  # FALSE for `mise activate` WITHOUT `--shims`: it rewrites PATH per

  # PATH. Measured in a login shell: the shims dir appeared 0 times in PATH.
  #
  # The consequence was Aaron's live report — from `~` on a host, `op` was
  # "command not found", while inside the checkout it resolved to the pinned
  # 2.34.1. On a DEVELOPER WORKSTATION that is correct and deliberate (the
  # pin travels with the project, exactly like a local `dotnet tool` manifest
  # or node_modules/.bin — Aaron: "it's like local scoped dotnet or npm …
  # that works great we don't need to global"). tools/setup/common/shellenv.sh
  # is therefore UNCHANGED.
  #
  # A CLUSTER NODE IS THE OTHER HOST CLASS, and here it is a real gap. A node
  # bootstrapping shared secrets is not sitting in the checkout — it is a
  # login shell in $HOME or a systemd unit — so project-scoped resolution has
  # nothing to scope to. Aaron 2026-08-22: "for the linux real hardware we
  # might need it global for op". The rest of this module already works around
  # it by hardcoding the shims dir into unit PATHs (zeta-ai-agent.nix,

  # BOTH lines below are required, and shims alone is NOT enough — measured:
  #   shims on PATH only          -> `op` runs and FAILS:
  #                                  "mise ERROR No version is set for shim: op"
  #   shims + MISE_GLOBAL_CONFIG_FILE -> `op --version` => 2.34.1
  # The shim dispatches back to mise, and outside a project mise has no config
  # declaring the tool. Pointing mise's GLOBAL config at the node's own Zeta
  # checkout supplies one WITHOUT duplicating the pin: the version still comes
  # from .mise.toml:114 ("1password-cli" = "2.34.1"), the single source of
  # truth. The rejected alternative is `mise use -g` (or a nixpkgs
  # `_1password-cli`), either of which forks the version and drifts — the
  # exact mistake Aaron already caught on this file for bun ("we already do
  # this we've drifted for nixos for some reason for bun", see the `mise`
  # entry in systemPackages above).
  #
  # Shims are APPENDED, not prepended, so inside the checkout `mise activate`'s
  # direct install paths still win and keep the fast path (measured 100 x
  # `op --version`: direct 1.47s vs shim 5.98s, ~4x).
  #
  # INTERIM, AND DELIBERATELY LABELLED AS SUCH. This exists because 1Password
  # is currently how shared secrets reach a node — Aaron: "not sure if that's
  # how we are going to share shared secrets until we have a decentralized way
  # of doing it". A node that must route through one vendor to boot has no
  # exit, which is an APPOINTED HUB under manifesto §1 and
  # .claude/rules/itron-hub-patent-boundary-p2p-is-the-upgrade.md. The
  # decentralized replacement is `proposed` only and is NOT designed here; it
  # belongs to the decentralized-identity-server lane. Tracked:
