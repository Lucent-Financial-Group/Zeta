# k3s-datastore-bootstrap-recovery.sh — recover a STILLBORN k3s datastore (one
# that has NEVER completed bootstrap) after a power cut in the first ~20
# seconds of a founding node's first boot; refuse loudly, and touch NOTHING,
# for every other shape of the same crash-loop.
#
# 081M39CR74D087G0R002BEG2G4. MEASURED (WP27's run 35968222668, graceful
# teardown, no self-heal -- the ESP marker was intact so all six WP11
# verdicts fired): k3sServiceActive=false, NRestarts=58, Result=exit-code,
# and 76x in the journal:
#
#   level=fatal msg="Error: preparing server: failed to bootstrap cluster
#   data: failed to reconcile with local datastore: no bootstrap data found
#   in datastore - check server token value and verify datastore integrity"
#
# k3s creates /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/db, gets roughly 20 seconds, and is
# stopped before it writes bootstrap data into it. A non-empty datastore is
# the one thing k3s will not initialise into, so it refuses forever. On
# metal: an operator who powers the machine off in the first ~20 seconds of
# its first boot -- impatience, a power cut, a tripped breaker -- gets a
# permanently wedged cluster that no reboot recovers. WP25's own ~495
# restarts (081M39B2MDA087G0R003CCEJPQ) are the same fatal, just unobserved
# because that run's verify unit never ran.
#
# THE NAIVE FIX IS CATASTROPHIC, AND THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT DO IT. Deleting the
# datastore whenever k3s reports this fatal is confiscation of the one thing
# on the machine that cannot be regenerated (manifesto §5) -- the exact thing
# `k3s-datastore-preflight.sh` already refuses to do, for the dirty-disk
# case.
#
# A CORRECTION, NOT A CLAIM. Earlier revisions of this header said k3s's
# message is "ambiguous by construction" -- that the identical text appears
# when a GOOD datastore meets a WRONG token. MEASURED (run 36095623765) and
# FALSE: a served datastore given a well-formed wrong token prints "bootstrap
# data already found and encrypted with different token", a DIFFERENT message.
# k3s distinguishes the two cases. Full measurement and the corrected
# reasoning live in `k3s-datastore-bootstrap-recovery.nix`'s header.
#
# What survives, and is the real reason for the sentinel: the stillborn
# signature is a SINGLE STRING IN AN UPSTREAM LOG LINE, and pinning data
# destruction to a log grep is fragile in a way a has-served marker is not.
# k3s can merge, reword or reorder those messages in any release.
#
# THE GUARD: A HAS-EVER-BOOTSTRAPPED SENTINEL, WRITTEN ELSEWHERE. This
# script never writes the sentinel itself --
# `k3s-datastore-bootstrap-sentinel-write.sh` (this module's sibling) writes
# it exactly once, when k3s has DEMONSTRABLY completed bootstrap (a real
# `/readyz` success, not something assumed). This script only ever READS it:
#
#   - Sentinel ABSENT + the fatal signature + enough restarts to be sure =
#     STILLBORN. This datastore has never held anything a client ever
#     depended on, so discarding it destroys no state. Recover: delete ONLY
#     the datastore directory, restart k3s, done -- ONCE per boot, ever.
#   - Sentinel PRESENT + the fatal signature = REFUSE. A datastore that has
#     served is never deleted, regardless of restart count -- loud refusal
#     with the remedy instead. NOTE this combination is not expected in the
#     wrong-token case at all: that case prints a different message (see the
#     correction above), so it is already excluded by the signature check.
#     This branch is the SECOND of two independent guards.
#   - The fatal signature ABSENT = some OTHER crash-loop. Not this script's
#     problem to fix; a loud, one-time diagnostic dump instead of silence.
#
# THE ONE-WAY PROPERTY: the recovery window opens at first boot and closes
# FOREVER the first time the cluster works. There is no code path in this
# script that can re-open it once the sentinel exists.
#
# SCOPE, STRICT: the ONLY path ever removed is $ZETA_DATASTORE_DIR (default
# /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/db) -- never server/tls, never server/cred,
# never anything named by path concatenation or a wildcard. And even that is
# removed at most ONCE per boot: a marker file records the attempt, and a
# second round of the same fatal after one recovery attempt gets the loud
# diagnostic path, not a second wipe.
#
# TESTABLE BY CONSTRUCTION: every external dependency (how to read the
# restart count, how to read the journal, how to restart k3s) is a
# COMMAND STRING read from an environment variable with a real-world
# default, so `src/Core.TypeScript/hygiene/k3s-datastore-bootstrap-recovery.test.ts`
# can execute this exact script with fake commands and fixture files and
# prove the has-served case is never touched, without a running systemd or
# k3s anywhere.
#
# NEVER FAILS THE CALLER: this script always exits 0. It is meant to run in
# a loop (systemd `Restart=always`), and its own failure must never become a
# new thing to crash-loop about.

# EVERY OUTCOME SPEAKS, AND THEY ARE DISTINGUISHABLE FROM EACH OTHER.
#
# The defect class this whole module exists inside of is a check whose
# FAILURE and whose ABSENCE look identical -- silence. The first revision of
# this script printed only on the paths where it ACTED, so a boot on which
# it decided "nothing to do" was byte-identical, on the console, to a boot on
# which the unit never started at all. That is the seventh instance of the
# same defect, written into the fix for the sixth.
#
# So every terminal path below ends in `verdict <code> <sentence>`, and the
# codes are mutually exclusive. The three that matter most, named:
#
#   stillborn-recovered  no sentinel, the datastore had never served, it was
#                        discarded so k3s could found fresh
#   served / served-refused
#                        the sentinel is present; this datastore has served
#                        and is NEVER touched, whatever k3s is reporting
#   datastore-absent     there is no datastore directory at all -- nothing to
#                        recover and nothing at risk
#
# PRINTED ONCE PER BOOT PER DISTINCT VERDICT, not once per poll: the unit
# restarts every 10s forever, so printing unconditionally would bury the
# console, and latching the FIRST verdict of the boot would report
# "watching" on a node that went on to recover. Recording the last verdict
# and printing only on CHANGE gives exactly one line per outcome that
# actually occurred, in the order they occurred -- the boot's whole story,
# in one line each. The state file lives on /run (tmpfs), so it is empty
# again at every boot without anything having to clean it up.
