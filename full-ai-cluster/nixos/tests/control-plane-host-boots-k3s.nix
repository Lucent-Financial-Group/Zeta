# full-ai-cluster/nixos/tests/control-plane-host-boots-k3s.nix
#
# WP20 — THE FAST, PRECISE ORACLE FOR THE REAL DEFECT. Boots the SAME
# `nixosConfigurations.control-plane` host the USB installer builds and asks
# the one question no test in this directory had ever asked: does k3s.service
# become active on the FULL host config, not just on the k3s-server.nix module
# in isolation?
#
# THE FINDING THIS TEST IS FOR
# -----------------------------
# Run 35717757526 (build-ai-cluster-iso.yml, scenario "WP11 installed-disk
# first-boot k3s verify") ran `nixos-install --flake .../full-ai-cluster#control-plane`
# for real, booted the INSTALLED disk with network, and k3s.service NEVER
# reached `active` in 4201s (the verify unit's own deadline). Every other VM
# test in this directory boots k3s-server.nix (or a couple of sibling modules)
# DIRECTLY -- none of them ever imports `hosts/control-plane/configuration.nix`
# whole, so none of them has ever exercised the FULL import graph: secure-boot,
# host-seal, tpm2-seal-prereqs, three AI-agent systemd services
# (otto/lior/vera), avahi, samba, docker, the k3s/longhorn/cilium-wireguard
# preflights, zeta-creds-restore/self-register/first-session, and injected-*.
# Every one of those is a candidate ordering-graph participant the smaller
# tests structurally cannot see.
#
# WHY THIS TEST DOES NOT COPY A MODULE LIST
# -------------------------------------------
# `imports = [ ../hosts/control-plane/configuration.nix ];` below is not a
# paraphrase of `flake.nix`'s `nixosConfigurations.control-plane` -- it is the
# exact same single-element module list `mkSystem` uses for that output
# (`flake.nix` line ~124-128: `modules = [ ./nixos/hosts/control-plane/configuration.nix ];`).
# `configuration.nix` itself pulls in `common.nix` (which pulls in every
# shared module) plus its own k3s-server/docker/local-storage/gpu-device-plugin/
# initial-password/operator-ssh-keys imports, so importing that one file IS
# importing the whole graph. There is no second copy of the list to drift.
#
# THE TWO DELIBERATE DEVIATIONS FROM `nixosConfigurations.control-plane`, AND
# WHY EACH ONE IS SAFE
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   1. `stateVersion` is not threaded through the flake's `inputs`/`specialArgs`
#      (nixosTest's node modules don't carry them). `common.nix` declares
#      `stateVersion ? "25.11"` with a Nix-level default, and the ORIGINAL
#      version of this file assumed that default would just apply, cosmetically,
#      leaving `system.stateVersion` at "25.11" instead of the flake's "26.05".
#      MEASURED WRONG (run 35741126744): `nixos/modules/tasks/swraid.nix`
#      forces `config.system.stateVersion` for its own compat check BEFORE
#      common.nix's `mkDefault stateVersion` line supplies a value, and
#      `pkgs.testers.nixosTest`'s `evalModules` call does not resolve an
#      absent, defaulted specialArg the way plain function application would
#      -- it throws `attribute 'stateVersion' missing`. Fixed below with an
#      explicit `_module.args.stateVersion = "26.05";` on `nodes.server`,
#      which both fixes the eval AND restores full fidelity (the real "26.05",
#      not the assumed-safe "25.11" fallback). Checked
#      (`grep -rl stateVersion nixos/modules/*.nix`): the only OTHER consumer
#      of the value once supplied is that same `system.stateVersion =
#      lib.mkDefault stateVersion;` line -- unrelated to k3s or systemd
#      ordering.
#   2. `virtualisation.{memorySize,cores,diskSize}` are VM-only options with no
#      hardware equivalent -- every other VM test in this directory sets them,
#      and this host boots MORE (avahi, samba, docker, k3s, three AI-agent
#      services, the full byte-lock toolchain closure) than any of them, so
#      it is sized at least as generously as the heaviest existing lane
#      (k3s-first-boot-roster.nix: 10240 MB / 4 cores / 32768 MB disk).
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* OVERRIDDEN, AND WHY
# -------------------------------------------------
#   * `hardware-configuration.nix` -- NOT replaced with a VM-specific stub.
#     The committed file (`hosts/control-plane/hardware-configuration.nix`) is
#     ITSELF already a QEMU-shaped placeholder (`lib.mkDefault` fileSystems on
#     `/dev/disk/by-label/{nixos,boot}`, virtio_pci/virtio_blk initrd modules)
#     kept so `nix flake check` passes pre-install -- and nixpkgs'
#     `qemu-vm.nix` test-driver module overrides `fileSystems` via
#     `mkVMOverride` regardless of what the host declares (it boots the built
#     `toplevel` directly with `-kernel`/`-initrd`, never through
#     `boot.loader`). So the stub already evaluates safely under nixosTest and
#     a second, VM-specific copy would be a second thing to keep in sync with
#     nothing corresponding on real hardware.
#   * `boot.loader.*` (systemd-boot / EFI vars) -- same reason: unused by the
#     nixosTest driver's default (non-bootloader) boot path; it evaluates and
#     is simply never exercised.
#   * `/etc/zeta/*` installer-written fixtures (cluster-node-id, join-server,
#     cluster-segment, initial-hashedpassword, operator pubkeys, cred blobs)
#     -- NOT staged. Every module that reads one of these is gated by
#     `builtins.pathExists` at EVAL time (injected-hostname.nix,
#     injected-cluster-address.nix, injected-join-server.nix,
#     injected-server-join.nix, initial-password.nix's runtime activation
#     script, operator-ssh-keys.nix) or by a RUNTIME `ConditionPathExists`
#     (zeta-creds-restore.nix, zeta-first-boot-k3s-verify.nix). Absent-file is
#     their documented no-op branch, and absent-file is exactly what the real
#     failing install exercised too: run 35717757526 was a bare
#     `nixos-install --flake .../full-ai-cluster#control-plane` with no prior
#     `zeta-install.sh` run, so it carried NO `/etc/zeta` fixtures either.
#     Staging fake ones here would make this test MORE installed than the
#     install that actually broke. `zeta.hostSeal.boxRole = "prod-metal"` (set
#     in configuration.nix itself, not overridden here) matches that same real
#     run too.
#   * `networking.networkmanager.enable` / NetworkManager itself -- NOT
#     swapped for plain DHCP the way `k3s-first-boot-roster.nix` does. That
#     swap is exactly what would hide the thing under investigation: the
#     `zeta-first-boot-k3s-verify.nix` incident (081M33XMWME087G0R000825CCB,
#     run 35697298781) measured a *different* unit's `After=network-online.target`
#     ordering dependency apparently never settling "on this image's first
#     boot (QEMU user-mode NIC + NetworkManager)" within 75+ minutes. Whether
#     that generalizes to k3s.service's OWN identical upstream dependency
#     (`nixpkgs/nixos/modules/services/cluster/rancher/default.nix`:
#     `after = [ "firewall.service" "network-online.target" ];
#      wants = [ "firewall.service" "network-online.target" ];`, confirmed
#     against the pinned nixos-26.05 branch, commit 1e8bc658) is precisely
#     hypothesis (2) this test exists to check -- so NetworkManager stays on.
#
# THREE SUBTESTS, IN COST ORDER
# --------------------------------
#   a) `systemd-analyze verify` + `journalctl -b | grep -i 'ordering cycle'`
#      -- catches hypothesis (1) (a real ordering CYCLE that systemd breaks by
#      deleting a job). Needs no network; runs first and fails fast.
#   b) k3s.service reaches `active` within a bounded window -- THE regression
#      gate for the actual measured defect. On failure, prints
#      `systemctl list-jobs`, `systemctl show k3s -p After -p Requires -p Wants`,
#      `systemctl status network-online.target NetworkManager-wait-online.service`,
#      and the ordering/failure grep again (state may have moved on since (a)).
#   c) The node reaches `Ready` (Cilium up) -- needs the chart image, hence
#      internet. Weaker signal than (b) but closes the loop to "does the
#      REAL first-boot experience work", which is WP20's actual charter.
#
# REQUIRES INTERNET for subtest (c) (Cilium's ~1 image), same discipline as
# `k3s-first-boot-roster.nix` and `k3s-cluster-online.nix`:
#
#   cd full-ai-cluster
#   nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.control-plane-host-boots-k3s -L --option sandbox false
#
# COST: heavier than k3s-first-boot-roster.nix -- this host's closure adds the
# full byte-lock toolchain (wabt/binaryen/emscripten/nodejs/zig/llvm/rustup/go/
# lua5), three AI-agent systemd services, avahi, samba and docker on top of
# everything the roster test already boots. Not wired per-PR for that reason;
# see `.github/workflows/control-plane-host-boots-k3s-vm.yml` (PRs scoped to
# this test's own inputs + daily cron + workflow_dispatch).
#
# WHAT IT IS NOT
# ----------------
#   * NOT a replacement for k3s-first-boot-roster.nix -- that test is the
#     detailed oracle for whether the ELEVEN-manifest roster converges
#     (root-application landing in particular). This test stops at "does k3s
#     even start, and does the node go Ready" on the FULL host config; it does
#     not assert anything about ArgoCD, SPIRE, cert-manager, or the rest of
#     the roster.
#   * NOT proof the real USB install path is fixed end-to-end -- it is the
#     fast, hermetic-as-possible proxy for the one link (k3s.service activation
#     on the full config) that a bare-metal install cannot cheaply re-run on
#     every PR.
