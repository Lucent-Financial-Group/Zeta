#
# WP25 (081M38G8NGC087G0R001GEGEDK). END-TO-END proof that the self-heal in
# `nixos/modules/k3s-agent-tls-self-heal.nix` actually recovers a node from
# the MEASURED defect CHAIN -- two bugs, found in sequence on real CI runs
# of this exact fix:
#   1. run 35927439681: k3s.service stuck `activating` forever because every
#      file under /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent was present but zero bytes (a
#      truncated write from an unclean stop -- this harness's own VM kill;
#      on real hardware a power cut during first boot).
#   2. WP25's own first re-run (target-1-only revision): fixing #1 exposed a
#      second failure at the same bootstrap endpoint -- "node password not
#      set" -- traced to /etc/rancher/node/password and
#      /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/cred/node-passwd suffering the identical
#      truncation. This test now reproduces and heals all three targets.
#
# THIS TEST'S OWN FIRST TWO WIRED RUNS caught two things in ITSELF, not in
# the module under test:
#   - PR run 35967573812: an immediate `succeed` on server/cred/node-passwd
#     right after `/readyz` failed the whole build -- a race, not a bug (k3s
#     writes that file as part of node REGISTRATION, which lands after
#     `/readyz` starts answering).
#   - PR run 35970475833: raising that to a 60s `wait_until_succeeds` still
#     timed out. In THIS single-node, embedded-etcd, --cluster-init hermetic
#     config, k3s's node-password mechanism resolves through a Kubernetes
#     Secret instead (`machine.node-password.k3s`), and the on-disk table
#     this module's target 3 heals is not guaranteed to appear on every k3s
#     boot shape or on this test's timeline.
# So target 3 is now OBSERVED best-effort (bounded poll, `node_passwd_present`
# below) rather than required -- its authoritative validation is the two REAL
# installed-disk CI runs cited inline where it is checked, not this VM.
# Targets 1 and 2 do not have this dependency and always run to completion.
#
# `lint-k3s-datastore-preflight.test.ts`'s sibling,
# `src/Core.TypeScript/hygiene/k3s-agent-tls-self-heal.test.ts`, already
# EXECUTES the repair SCRIPT over fixture directories and proves the pure
# "which files get removed" logic. What no fixture-directory test can reach
# is whether systemd actually runs the ExecStartPre before k3s, and whether
# a REAL k3s -- not a fixture -- actually regenerates the files and reaches
# `active` once they're gone. That is this test's whole job.
#
# WHY A REBOOT-INTO-BROKEN-STATE SCRIPT, NOT A FRESH BOOT WITH PRE-SEEDED
# EMPTY FILES: k3s's cert material does not exist before k3s has run once,
# so there is nothing to truncate before a first boot. The measured defect
# is specifically a SECOND start (after an unclean stop) finding files a
# FIRST start already created. This test reproduces that shape directly:
# boot once for real, stop k3s, truncate every agent file to 0 bytes (the
# measured state, exactly), and start k3s again. Without the self-heal,
# k3s would retry the same "error loading key ...: <nil>" forever (measured:
# 70+ minutes and counting on the real box) and this test would time out on
# the second `wait_for_unit`; with it, the zero-length files are gone before
# k3s's first read, dynamiclistener's LoadOrGenerateKeyFile sees a genuine
# IsNotExist, and k3s reaches active again.
#
# HERMETIC SCOPE, same line as the sibling tests: no internet in the nix
# build sandbox, so no Cilium image and the node never reaches k8s Ready.
# This test asserts k3s.service itself (`active` + the API `/readyz`
# endpoint), which is exactly the layer the measured defect broke --
# `k3s-cluster-online.nix` (non-hermetic, needs `--option sandbox false`)
# is the readiness/CNI layer above this one.
