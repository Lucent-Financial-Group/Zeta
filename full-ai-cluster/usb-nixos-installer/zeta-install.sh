# zeta-install — greedy N-disk installer for the AI cluster.
#
# Lives on the USB at /run/current-system/sw/bin/zeta-install (installed
# by the installer's configuration.nix). Walks through:
#
#   1. Enumerate ALL internal disks (NVMe, SATA SSD, HDD, SAS, etc.;
#      USB + removable + read-only excluded automatically)
#   2. Sort by speed class (NVMe first, then SSDs, then HDDs)
#   3. Pick the fastest disk as the BOOT disk (override via $BOOT_DISK
#      or interactive prompt; "auto" is the explicit default form)
#   3a. PRE-FORMAT PROBE (R6): read-only inspect every in-scope disk and
#       PRINT what is on it (partition table, Zeta ESP, zeta-creds blob,
#       foreign filesystems with labels and ext4 used space). Failure-closed:
#       a disk that will not probe never reads as blank.
#   3b. REPAIR MODE (R4): recognise a prior Zeta install, recover identity
#       read-only so a re-paved node rejoins as ITSELF. An unvalidatable
#       remembered identity STOPS the wipe (HWR-2: two registrations, one MAC).
#   3c. CIRCUIT BREAKER (R9): bounded destructive attempts, counted in a
#       ledger on the boot USB ESP. OPEN flips the cancel window default to
#       ABORT. It never silently retries.
#   4. CANCEL WINDOW (R7): a countdown whose default is PROCEED, so the USB
#      still boots headless; any keypress aborts to a shell. This runs on the
#      zero-typing path too. The typed WIPE prompt still exists for direct
#      interactive use and is still bypassed by ZETA_AUTO_CONFIRM=WIPE, but it
#      is NO LONGER the only gate: the countdown is unconditional.
#      ZETA_AUTO_CONFIRM=WIPE also skips iter-5.3 password,
#      081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69.3b passphrase, gh-auth, vendor logins.
#   5. Wipe + partition:
#        BOOT disk: ESP 1G + root (a COMPUTED FLOOR, 120G) + longhorn1 (the
#        REST of the disk). WP28 inverted this: root used to fill the disk and
#        longhorn1 got a fixed 1G tail, so a 1 TiB single-disk install handed
#        Longhorn ONE GIBIBYTE against a roster declaring ~943G of
#        driver.longhorn.io PVCs. The root floor is the whole roster's unpacked
#        container images (73G) + OS/swap/logs (30G) x 1.15.
#        LONGHORN1_TAIL=<size> overrides and root then takes what is left.
#        DATA disks: each becomes a single longhorn{2..N} whole-disk
#   6. Format (FAT32 ESP + ext4 root + ext4 longhorn{1..N})
#   7. Mount per the standard /mnt/var/lib/longhorn-disk{1..N} layout
#   8. Clone Zeta + nixos-install for the chosen host
#
# Storage backend is currently Longhorn (ext4 + mount at standard
# paths). Ceph/Rook is the planned alternative (B-future): takes the
# same data-disk slots but manages them as raw block devices. When
# that lands, set STORAGE_BACKEND=ceph to switch the formatting
# strategy. For now only `longhorn` (default) is implemented.

# classification, no IO: "empty" (nothing to honour -- today's unpinned

# ZETA-LB-POOL-BEGIN ---------------------------------------------
# docs/ops/INSTALL-TIME-CONFIG.md — the install-time settings that are a FACT
# ABOUT THE LAN: the Cilium LoadBalancer address range, and whether the cluster's
# own pod/service address space collides with the network this node is plugged
# into. Pure functions plus one resolver; checked for parity against
# src/Core.TypeScript/installer/lan-config.ts by
# src/Core.TypeScript/installer/lan-config-shell-parity.test.ts.
#
# THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES: `cilium-lb-ipam/ip-pool.yaml` shipped 192.168.1.240-250.
# On any other subnet Cilium hands every `type: LoadBalancer` Service (the portal
# gateway, GitLab) an address no router knows, and nothing says so. A generic
# installer edits no file, so every install applied it. Nothing in the repo
# carries a default any more; the value comes from here.
#
# RESOLUTION ORDER, and nothing else:
#   1. ZETA_LB_POOL from the ESP /zeta-firstboot.conf (zflash --lb-pool;
#      zeta-first-boot.sh exports it): `auto`, or `<first-ip>-<last-ip>`;
#   2. otherwise ASK — before any disk work — offering a PROPOSAL derived from the
#      detected LAN (.240-.250 of the node's /24) that is only ever applied on an
#      explicit `y`;
#   3. otherwise UNSET, loudly: no pool is applied, Services of type LoadBalancer
#      stay <pending>, and the completion banner says exactly that.
# A value that fails validation or whose addresses already answer on the LAN is
# REFUSED, never repaired: non-interactively that REFUSES the install (nothing has
# been wiped yet); interactively it is asked again.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED, NOT FAIL-OPEN: every function below answers a verdict word, never a
# guess. "The probe did not run" is reported as such and is not a pass.

# ── Force-reformat override (R4-reformat, 2026-08-23) ─────────────
#
# Aaron 2026-08-22: "we could allow for an override to completely reformat and
# ignore the installed version as an override."
#
# THIS IS THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE ACTION THE INSTALLER CAN TAKE, so it is the
# MOST bounded, not the exception. It routes THROUGH `zeta_pf_breaker` with a
# STRICTER bound (`ZETA_MAX_REFORMAT_ATTEMPTS`, default 1) rather than around
# it. There is deliberately no branch anywhere that reaches the wipe with the
# breaker unread: a `blind` breaker (attempts cannot be counted) and an `open`
# one (the bound is already spent) both REFUSE the override outright, where the
# ordinary repair path merely widens the cancel window. A destructive attempt
# that cannot be COUNTED is exactly the R9 loop, and a reformat is the worst
# instance of it.
#
# THREE INDEPENDENT FACTORS, none of them inferrable:
#
#   1. `ZETA_FORCE_REFORMAT` must equal the exact literal `REFORMAT`. Not `1`,
#      not `yes`, not `true` — a truthy-looking value left in an environment
#      does nothing.
#   2. `ZETA_FORCE_REFORMAT_NODE_ID` must NAME the node actually found on the
#      disk THIS RUN (or the literal `unreadable` when, and only when, nothing
#      readable was recovered). This is what a stale env var cannot satisfy: it
#      names a DIFFERENT machine, and it also makes the override SELF-DISARMING
#      — once the reformat succeeds the node has a new id, so the same
#      environment on the next boot no longer matches and refuses.
#   3. Interactively, the operator types `REFORMAT` at a prompt of its own,
#      before the existing `WIPE` one. On the declared zero-typing path
#      (`ZETA_AUTO_CONFIRM=WIPE`) there is by construction nobody to type, so
#      factor 2 carries the per-machine attestation there. Note the mode is
#      taken from ZETA_AUTO_CONFIRM and NOT from `[ -t 0 ]`: the headless
#      first-boot path DOES have a tty (the cancel window reads keypresses on
#      it), so a tty test would have silently demanded typing from a path
#      whose whole premise is that nobody is at the keyboard.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT CHANGE: consent. Recovery still happens read-only under
# `-o ro,noload` BEFORE any of this is evaluated — indeed the override CANNOT
# arm without it, because factor 2 needs the recovered id. The override decides
# what happens AFTER consent (mint a fresh identity instead of reusing the
# recovered one), never when consent may be assumed. It never shortens the
# cancel window and never flips a `default=abort` back to `proceed`.
#
# $1=flagToken $2=declaredNodeId $3=recoveredNodeId $4=reformatBreakerState
# $5=typedConfirmation, or the literal `non-interactive` on the zero-typing path.
# Prints exactly one line: `armed`, or `refused <reason>`. Never blank.

# ZETA-NODE-ZETAID-BEGIN -----------------------------------------
# Mint a node ZetaId at install time — the stable 128-bit key this installer
# did not have.
#
# Aaron 2026-08-22, on the MEASURED GAP recorded at Step 2.7 ("nothing in the
# tree writes a ZetaId at install time"): *"yes we should move this to a
# zetaid."*
#
# WHY Category.InventoryAsset (10) AND NOT A NEW CATEGORY. A cluster node is a
# physical machine, and physical machines already have a category and a
# minting convention: `inventory/items/*.md` is described by
# inventory/reconcile-surfaces.ts as the *register* — "identity of record;
# ZetaId-keyed, git-as-database" — and `inventory/new-item.ts` mints exactly
# `packGeneric(1, Category.InventoryAsset, (ms << 78) | random78)`. This block
# reproduces THAT id scheme byte-for-byte rather than inventing a parallel one.
# There is no node/traveler category slot today; adding one is a four-oracle
# byte-lock change (TS + C# + F# + Rust all pack Category), and the smallest
# honest addition is to reuse the register a node is already IN. The sizing of
# a dedicated slot is filed, not silently skipped:
# workitems/081M0QB3HP2087G0R0029W97ZZ-*.md.
#
# BIT LAYOUT (src/Core.TypeScript/zeta-id/zeta-id.gen.ts BIT_MASKS + zeta-id.ts
# packGeneric), MSB first, so the string below can be read against the source:
#
#   bits 127..123  version  = 1                    -> 00001
#   bits 122..69   payload >> 65   (54 bits)
#   bits  68..65   category = 10                   -> 1010
#   bits  64..0    payload & (2^65-1)  (65 bits)
#
# and payload itself is 119 bits: ms(41) << 78 | random(78). So the emitted
# 26-char Crockford string sorts chronologically, exactly as `ls workitems/`
# does, for the same reason.
#
# WHY IT IS DONE IN SHELL AT ALL. The installer runs inside the NixOS ISO with
# no bun, no node and no network; a mint that needed the TypeScript generator
# would simply not run. So this is a fifth oracle for one narrow path, and it
# is BYTE-LOCKED against the TypeScript one over fixed vectors by
# installer/node-zetaid.test.ts. bash-3.2 subset (no bignum, no arrays here),
# same reason as the preflight parity block: the test must run on the
# maintainer's macOS bash too.
#
# DST SEAM: the pure function takes (ms, randomHex) as ARGUMENTS. The clock and
# /dev/urandom enter only in the `zeta_mint_node_zetaid` wrapper below — the
# same boundary discipline as new-workitem.ts's `WorkItemEnv`, and what lets

# ZETA-HWCONFIG-CAPTURE-BEGIN ------------------------------------
# Pure decision functions for Step 6's hardware-configuration.nix capture.
#
# NOTHING IN THIS BLOCK TOUCHES A DEVICE, AND NOTHING IN IT WRITES.
# It reads paths and prints a verdict on stdout, so it can be extracted by
# src/Core.TypeScript/installer/hardware-config-capture.test.ts and executed
# under bash against tmpdir fixtures. Same bash-3.2 subset, same reason, as
# the ZETA-PREFLIGHT-PARITY block above.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL
# ----------------------
# The capture used to be:
#
#     if [ -f "$HW_SRC" ] && [ -e "$HW_DST" ]; then cp ...
#     else echo "WARN: hardware-configuration not copied" >&2; fi
#
# A FAILED capture printed one stderr line and the install continued, baking
# the committed placeholder -- which declares only / and /boot. The
# longhorn{1..N} partitions this script had just created, formatted and
# mounted therefore got no `fileSystems` entry and never mounted again on the
# installed node.
#
# That compounds with the boot-time Longhorn preflight added in PR #13252:
# nixos/modules/longhorn-preflight-checks.nix derives its must-be-mounted set
# from the host's OWN `fileSystems`. A placeholder node declares no Longhorn
# path, so the required set is EMPTY and the mount check passes with nothing
# to check. A silent install-time fallback turned a brand-new guard into a
# check that cannot fail -- a check that did not run looking exactly like a
# check that passed.
#
# So the capture fails CLOSED, and it checks the CONTENT rather than the file
# operation: the destination must declare every Longhorn mountpoint this
# install actually mounted. `cp` returning 0 was never the property we wanted.
#
# NOTE ON THE COMMITTED PLACEHOLDERS: hosts/control-plane and hosts/worker-gpu
# ship a `/`+`/boot` hardware-configuration.nix ON PURPOSE, so `nix flake
# check` can evaluate an unprovisioned host in CI. That committed state is
# CORRECT and is not what these functions object to. The defect was never the
# file's contents in git -- it was the install-time capture failing quietly.

# $1=hw_src $2=host_dir $3=hw_dst
# Prints exactly one verdict line. Failure CLOSED: every path that is not a
# proven-good capture prints REFUSE or SKIP, never blank.

#
# Read-only mount of a FAT ESP, with THREE attempts instead of one.
#
# blkid parses the FAT superblock in USERSPACE; `mount -t vfat` additionally
# needs the kernel driver AND its NLS charset modules. "Label readable, mount
# refused" -- which is what run 36044770870's guest reported for EVERY
# candidate, `/dev/disk/by-label/EFIBOOT` included -- is the signature of a
# kernel-side capability problem, not a data problem. That reading survives
# every measurement taken: both ISOs put the ESP at LBA 268, the pre-WP29
# detector resolves 137_216 through the MBR branch on both, and replaying the
# bake on the failing ISO yields a clean, mountable, byte-exact ESP.
#
# Two causes fit, and they are told apart ON SIGHT by what this records:
#   - NLS charset unavailable -> `FAT-fs: IO charset iso8859-1 not found` /
#     `codepage cp437 not found` as -EINVAL. Attempt 3 names a charset
#     explicitly and may succeed where attempt 1 was refused.
#   - a device-level read error -> all three fail, each with the kernel's own
#     words. Three errors instead of one is strictly more information.
#
# Under the first cause this turns a lost install into a completed one plus a
# diagnostic; under the second it costs two syscalls and buys evidence. It is
# a MITIGATION: it explains nothing and does not close the work item.
#
# Attempt 2 drops `-t vfat` and lets the kernel autodetect, which is also the
# only attempt that could mount something that is NOT FAT (this probe walks
# iso9660 partitions too), so its success is accepted ONLY after the mounted
# type is confirmed FAT. With no way to confirm, the attempt counts as failed:
# an unconfirmable mount is not a pass.

# ROOT CAUSE, measured on run 36073981145 and reproduced locally end to end.
# An isohybrid ISO's partition 1 starts at LBA 0 and spans the whole image, so
# `/dev/sda` and `/dev/sda1` expose the SAME iso9660 filesystem with the SAME
# `ZETA_INSTALL` label. `/dev/disk/by-label/ZETA_INSTALL` therefore resolves to
# whichever udev processed last. When it resolves to the WHOLE DISK, the boot
# medium is mounted from `/dev/sda`, which holds that device O_EXCL -- and
# every partition of it becomes unopenable for the rest of the install:
#
#   picker lane:  sda1 AND sda2 = `fsconfig system call failed: Can't open blockdev`
#   four others:  sda1 = openable (iso9660, not FAT), sda2 = mounted
#
# Same ISO, same run, minutes apart. Local proof with a real isohybrid image:
# `mount -t vfat` on the partition succeeds with the whole disk unclaimed and
# is refused with `already mounted or mount point busy` once `mount <disk>` is
# held. Rungs 1-3 all lose, because all three open the partition.
#
# NOT A CI DEFECT. A real USB stick is the same isohybrid image with the same
# LBA-0 partition 1, the same duplicate label and the same udev race, so on
# metal this silently costs the operator their injected SSH pubkeys, their
# chosen hostname and their wifi credentials, and the node comes up as
# `node-<6hex>` with no indication why.
#
# THE CLAIM NEVER CLEARS -- `/iso` stays mounted for the whole install -- so
# waiting was never an option; the rung has to route around it.
#
# WHY MTOOLS AND NOT `losetup -r`: both avoid the exclusive claim, and mtools
# is the smaller answer. `mcopy -i <wholedisk>@@<offset>` needs no mount, no
# loop device to allocate and release, and no kernel FAT driver at all -- it is
# the exact inverse of how the ESP was WRITTEN (`mcopy -i img@@offset` on the
# host), and `mtools` ships in this ISO's systemPackages beside `util-linux`.
# Verified working while the claim is held, on a real isohybrid image.
#
# THE OFFSET IS DERIVED, NEVER CONSTANT. This work item began with a fallback
# constant that was wrong and could not disagree with itself; a second constant
# would be the same mistake. `lsblk -bno START` reads sysfs, so it needs no
# open of the partition -- which is the whole point, since the partition is
# what cannot be opened. Unreadable => REFUSE, never guess. Zero (the LBA-0
# alias) or a whole-disk candidate => look the ESP up BY TYPE among the parent
# disk's partitions (081M3B7Z38Q087G0R003F9X7HM) -- still derived, never assumed.
#
# READ-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION: this materialises a COPY of the ESP onto a fresh
# tmpfs at the caller's mountpoint. Every consumer keeps working on a path and
# the caller's `umount` still unmounts. Writes to it would NOT reach the ESP;
# no read-only consumer writes, and the `rw` ledger mount is a different
# function that is deliberately untouched.

#
# The loop R9 names is a REBOOT loop: install fails, first-boot runs again,
# the disks get wiped again. Breaking it therefore needs a NON-VOLATILE
# counter, and the only non-volatile writable surface that is not about to
# be wiped is the boot USB ESP. When that surface cannot be written the
# breaker is BLIND, and a breaker that cannot count must never read as a
# closed one, so BLIND forces the full cancel window.

# Append ONE record to the attempt ledger, numbered contiguously after the
# records already on disk.
#
# BOTH ledger writes go through here -- the `started` record before the first
# destructive call and the `ok` record after the last step -- so the two can
# never disagree about numbering. Until this function existed there was only
# ONE write site and it only ever wrote `started`, which zeta_pf_validate_ledger
# counts as a failure. Nothing wrote `ok`, so the failure count never reset and
# the bound counted INSTALLS rather than failures: measured on main, three
# SUCCESSFUL installs from one stick left `trusted 3` and the fourth boot came
# up with the breaker OPEN. A breaker that counts successes as failures strands
# an operator who is doing nothing wrong.
#
# APPEND ONLY, deliberately. Rewriting the `started` line in place would need a
# read-modify-write on a FAT ESP whose entire job is to survive a node dying
# mid-install. A `started` with no `ok` after it IS the failure signal, so power
# loss needs no record of its own to be counted -- which is what keeps R9
# bounded rather than aspirational.
#
# $ZETA_SUDO exists so this function is reachable from a test with no root, no
# USB and no block device. It is "sudo" everywhere in the installer itself; the
# falsifier in installer/install-ledger-append.test.ts sets it empty.
ZETA_SUDO="${ZETA_SUDO-sudo}"
# $ZETA_LEDGER_SYNC is the SECOND injected seam, and it exists for the same
# reason as the first: `sync` with no argument flushes EVERY filesystem on the
# host, so its duration is set by the host's dirty page cache and by nothing
# this installer -- or a test of it -- did. In the installer that cost is the
# point: the whole reason the record is written is that the node may lose power
# in the next second. In a test it is a wall-clock wait on unrelated global
# state, which is the definition of a nondeterministic test.
#
# MEASURED 2026-08-22 on the fleet host: 40 `sync` calls took 3.78-4.19 s
# (~95 ms each) against 0.146-0.245 s for 40 trivial process spawns (~4 ms) --
# 24x, and the 95 ms is not a constant, it is whatever the machine owes the
# disk at that instant. The R9 falsifier runs six appends per scenario and had
# grown to 100.1% of bun's 5000 ms per-test cap on that term alone.
#
# The DEFAULT IS THE REAL BARRIER and must stay that way; pinned by
# install-ledger-append.test.ts ("the durability barrier defaults to a real
# sync"). A test may substitute a recorder, which is strictly more checking

# ── Step 2.7: repair mode / recognise-self (R4, 2026-05-25) ───────
#
# Aaron: "the USB basically says, hey, am I already running on this? I am?
# Let me make sure I recover any hardware IDs and stuff and just reinstall
# the image."
#
# Recovery is READ ONLY and uses -o ro,noload on ext4 on purpose: a plain
# -o ro mount still REPLAYS THE JOURNAL, which is a write to a disk we have
# not yet been given consent to touch. noload suppresses that.
#
# THE GAP THIS USED TO RECORD IS CLOSED (2026-08-23, Aaron: "yes we should
# move this to a zetaid"). It read: "nothing in the tree writes a ZetaId at
# install time. /etc/zeta/cluster-node-id is the closest existing stable key,
# so that is what is recovered." Step 6.6 now writes /etc/zeta/node-zetaid
# (Category.InventoryAsset, minted by the ZETA-NODE-ZETAID block above), and
# this step RECOVERS it.
#
# RECOVERS, never re-mints. A repaired node that came back with a new ZetaId
# would have FORGOTTEN ITSELF across the repair -- manifesto §5, memory
# preservation, is the whole reason recognise-self exists. Re-minting is
# correct in exactly one place: a deliberate force-reformat, which is a
# different node by declaration (see Step 2.75).
#
# cluster-node-id is UNCHANGED and still written. The ZetaId is a sibling key,
# not a replacement: injected-hostname.nix reads cluster-node-id at evaluation
# time and the roster is keyed by hostname, so retiring it here would break
# both. Two keys with two jobs -- the hostname is what the network calls this
# machine, the ZetaId is what the substrate calls it.

# getting it wrong destroys data, and until 2026-08-23 nothing in CI had ever

# ── Step 2.9: the cancel window (R7, 2026-06-09) ──────────────────
#
# Aaron: "it should NOT ask before format; it should ask to CANCEL for a
# minute before format; this USB should fully boot headless."
#
# What was here before this block: NOTHING. There was no sleep between the
# device list and wipefs, and zeta-first-boot.sh exported
# ZETA_AUTO_CONFIRM=WIPE which skipped the typed prompt, so the wipe followed
# the device list immediately. The comment in zeta-first-boot.sh claimed the
# consent WAS that Ctrl-C window. It described a window of zero width.
#
# THE ANSWER TO SECTION 5.5 (does the countdown run on the zero-typing path
# too): YES. It runs on every path, including ZETA_AUTO_CONFIRM=WIPE.
# Reasoning: the zero-typing path is precisely where nobody is watching a
# prompt, which makes it the one place a wrong-disk wipe is both
# unrecoverable and unwitnessed. A gate that is absent there is absent.
#
# THE COST, STATED: up to 60 s per node, once, at install. It is paid against
# an install that then runs for tens of minutes, and nodes flash in parallel
# so it overlaps rather than accumulating. It is NOT free and it is not being
# claimed as free.
#
# THE COST IS ALSO SHAPED: when every in-scope disk probes BLANK the window
# is 10 s, because there is nothing on those disks to consent to losing.
# Foreign data, a prior Zeta install, or a probe that FAILED all get the full
# 60 s. Failure-closed: an unreadable disk is treated as a full disk.
#
# THE ROSTER IS REPRINTED HERE, at the gate, and not left to the Step 1 table.
# The operator watching a countdown must not have to scroll back through a
# preflight probe to learn what is about to be destroyed, and "the disks listed
# above" names nothing on a console that has already scrolled. Every in-scope
# device is named by PATH, SIZE and MODEL at the moment the clock is running.
#
# FAIL CLOSED ON AN UNSIZEABLE DEVICE. A device the kernel will not report a
# size for is a device we cannot account for, so the default flips to ABORT
# rather than being destroyed on a description we could not produce. An empty
# MODEL is NOT that case -- virtio and many NVMe controllers report none, and
# treating a missing marketing string as an unreadable device would refuse
# every QEMU install for no safety gain. Size is the discriminator; model is

  # TWO BUGS LIVED HERE, and they compounded into the opposite of the intended

  #
  # 1. `read -n 1` consumes Return as its DELIMITER and yields an EMPTY
  #    variable, while still returning success. The old loop tested
  #    `[ -n "$ZETA_CANCEL_KEY" ]`, so Enter -- the key a worried operator
  #    actually mashes -- did NOT cancel. A successful read IS a keypress; that
  #    is what is tested now.
  # 2. The countdown decremented once per ITERATION, but `read` returns
  #    IMMEDIATELY when a key arrives instead of spending its 1s timeout. So a
  #    burst of keypresses spun the window to zero in milliseconds. Measured:
  #    five Enters into a 5s window gave `cancelled=NO elapsed=0s`.
  #
  # Together: mashing Enter burned the entire window AND failed to cancel --
  # a guard that fails precisely when someone panics. The deadline is now
  # wall-clock, so an early return cannot spend time it did not wait.
  #
  # Local wall-clock is correct here and is not a shared-fold leak: this steers

# me to type a password instead of having a default" — replaces
# the iter-4.x hardcoded `zeta-change-me` default with an
# operator-chosen password set at install time.
#
# Operator types password ONCE on cluster console (read -s; hidden);
# script hashes via mkpasswd ($6$ = sha512crypt); writes hash to
# /mnt/etc/zeta/initial-hashedpassword. The
# nixos/modules/initial-password.nix module reads that file via
# builtins.readFile at NixOS evaluation time + sets
# users.users.zeta.hashedPassword.
#
# Fallback: if operator presses Enter to skip (no password typed),
# the module's BACKWARD-COMPAT fallback hash (= sha512crypt of
# "zeta-change-me") stays in effect so the system still boots
# with a known credential.
#
# Why type-on-console (one exception to typing-avoidance discipline):
# secrets shouldn't transit non-operator surfaces (USB ESP, Aaron's
# Mac keychain, etc.); operator-typed at install time is the
# safest path. This composes with the wifi nmtui exception in
# zeta-first-boot.sh — both are operator-typed-once-on-cluster.

#
# Two-step lifecycle for the operator-entered passphrase, designed
# to minimize /proc/<pid>/environ exposure window:
#
#   - Step 6.56 (here): captured into the NON-EXPORTED shell
#     variable ZETA_CREDS_PASSPHRASE_VAL. Bash shell variables
#     without `export` live in the shell's own variable table but
#     are NOT copied into /proc/<pid>/environ for child processes
#     to read.
#
#   - Step 6.95-picker: inline-set
#     `ZETA_CREDS_PASSPHRASE="$ZETA_CREDS_PASSPHRASE_VAL" sudo
#     --preserve-env=ZETA_CREDS_PASSPHRASE ...` exports the env
#     var into the sudo subprocess ONLY (where the picker bash -c
#     reads it via --passphrase-env). Parent installer shell never
#     has ZETA_CREDS_PASSPHRASE exported.
#
#   - Step 6.95 post-picker: ZETA_CREDS_PASSPHRASE_VAL `unset`
#     unconditionally after the if/else block so it fires whether
#     the picker actually ran OR was skipped (env opt-out / file
#     marker / missing UUID).
#
# Operator pain point 2026-05-27: "i'm witing on the tool to be

# things to whoever reads this log after a data loss:
#
#   recovered              -- a repair. The node keeps the identity it had.
#                             This is manifesto §5 (memory preservation) doing
#                             its job: a node that came back with a new key
#                             would have forgotten itself across a repair.
#   minted-on-repair-legacy -- a repair of a node installed BEFORE this file
#                             existed. There is nothing to recover, so one is

# read /etc/zeta/* files at build time. Several NixOS modules in the
# flake use `builtins.pathExists` + `builtins.readFile` on absolute
# `/etc/zeta/*` paths at evaluation time (flake build-time). During
# nixos-install from live ISO, those paths refer to the LIVE ISO root
# (files absent) NOT the install target /mnt/etc/zeta/ (files present
# from earlier install steps).
#
# Modules affected (same bug class):
#   - injected-hostname.nix       → /etc/zeta/cluster-node-id (Bug 1)
#   - operator-authorized-keys.nix → /etc/zeta/operator-authorized-keys

#   - initial-password.nix → activation reads /etc/zeta/initial-hashedpassword
#     at boot-time on installed system; doesn't need this symlink
#
# Fix: per-file symlinks (NOT directory-level — /etc/zeta may already
# exist as a real dir + sym-replacement would lose contents). Only
# create the symlink if the destination doesn't already exist (handles
# rebuild-on-installed-system case where /etc/zeta/* are real files).
#
# Cleanup: trap-based so removal happens even if nixos-install fails or
# is Ctrl-C'd. Defense-in-depth via explicit cleanup at end too.
#

#
# CORRECTION 2026-08-21 — this comment used to say "flake pure-mode REFUSES
# non-store absolute paths", which is the readFile half only and is wrong in
# the direction that hurts. Measured on Determinate Nix 3.21.0 / Nix 2.34.6:
#
#     builtins.readFile   "/etc/hosts"  in pure eval -> error, loud
#     builtins.pathExists "/etc/hosts"  in pure eval -> false, SILENT
#
# Every module above guards its readFile behind a pathExists, so pure eval
# does not refuse — it takes the "no file, keep the default" branch. A pure
# rebuild therefore reverts the node with no error at all: hostname back to
# the flake default, k3s serverAddr back to mkDefault, static segment
# addressing gone, and the operator's captured pubkeys REMOVED from
# authorized_keys. Every nixos-rebuild string this script prints now carries
# --impure, and src/Core.TypeScript/hygiene/lint-nixos-rebuild-needs-impure.ts
# keeps it that way.
#
# Safe here because:
#   - Impure reads are operator-chosen hostname + operator's PUBLIC SSH
#     pubkeys (NOT secrets — pubkeys are public by definition)
#   - initial-password.nix does NOT use builtins.readFile (per 081KSGS9H0008QG0R00120EEHM
#     Bug 3b fix uses activation-script instead); its hash file (which

# ── Step 6.93b: WP34 — copy the bootstrap container images off the ISO ────────
#
# 081M3BZ111D087G0R000YBMKRY. The installed node's very first boot pulls 134
# container images across EIGHT registries, and the pull-through mirror covers
# ONE of them (docker.io, 48/134, 36%). The 25 images the BOOTSTRAP roster
# needs -- cilium, cert-manager, spire, trust-manager, external-secrets, argocd,
# local-path -- are 21/25 on registries the mirror does NOT cover. If quay.io or
# ghcr.io is down, or this operator's NAT has spent its per-source-IP budget on
# somebody else's pulls, those charts never come up and the only explanation the
# operator gets is an ImagePullBackOff on a box nobody is SSH'd into.
#
# The ISO carries them (isoImage.contents in
# usb-nixos-installer/nixos/installer/configuration.nix). k3s imports every
# archive in /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/images/ into containerd at agent startup
# BEFORE any pull is attempted, so this copy is the whole mechanism.
#
# WHY A COPY AND NOT A NIX STORE PATH: this installer runs `nixos-install
# --flake /mnt/etc/zeta/full-ai-cluster#$HOST` against a fresh GIT CLONE, and a
# clone cannot contain a 1 GB tarball. The full reasoning, including why a
# fixed-output derivation and an install-time fetch were both rejected, is in
# nixos/modules/k3s-bootstrap-image-preload.nix.
#
# NON-FATAL BY DESIGN, AND NEVER SILENT. A node with a working network installs
# perfectly well without this, so a missing or unreadable archive must not abort
# an install that is otherwise complete -- that would turn a reliability
# improvement into a new way to lose a machine. But absence is announced here
# AND on every subsequent boot by
# zeta-bootstrap-image-preload-status.service, which writes a named
# PRESENT/ABSENT verdict to /run. The failure this whole work item is about is a
# step that did not happen and left no record; a skip nobody prints would be

# ── Step 6.94: 081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69.3a cred-picker stub ───────────────────────────
# The actual picker invocation lives at Step 6.95-picker (below) which
# fires AFTER 6.95a-bootstrap clones the repo + installs bun. This
# header reserves the step number for forward references; no work here.

# ── Step 6.95: iter-5.5.0 — claude-code install + credential persistence (081KSGS9H0008QG0R001JNKBFD Phase 2) ──
# Aaron 2026-05-27 ask: "wanna make this automatic on boot before i even
# login and have it save my claude code device login like gh, also make
# sure they are all on path for me to play with when i log in?"
#
# This step mirrors iter-5.4.0's gh-auth pattern at install-time for the
# node-local Claude Code agent (081KSGS9H0008QG0R001JNKBFD). Three parts:
#
#   1. INSTALL Claude Code via npm globally into a writable prefix
#      under /mnt/home/zeta (so it survives reboot AND is in the zeta
#      user's PATH via .npm-global/bin from /etc/profile.d).
#
#   2. PERSIST credentials to /mnt/home/zeta/.config/{gh,claude}/ with
#      zeta-user ownership. This closes the iter-5.4.0 gap empirically
#      observed 2026-05-27: gh auth login wrote /root/.config/gh/ in the
#      INSTALLER environment but the installed system's zeta user had no
#      credentials post-reboot. iter-5.5.0 fixes both `gh` and `claude`
#      auth persistence in one step.
#
#   3. PRE-CLONE the Zeta repo to /mnt/home/zeta/Zeta so first-login
#      operator workflow is "cd ~/Zeta && claude" with no extra setup.
#
# Skip conditions (P2 fix per PR #5388 Copilot review — comment
# updated to match ACTUAL control-flow, which doesn't gate on
# GH_AUTH_OK):
#   - /mnt/home/zeta doesn't exist (means nixos-install hasn't created
#     the user yet — possible if Step 6.x ordering changes)
# iter-5.5.0 runs REGARDLESS of GH_AUTH_OK because: (a) claude install
# only needs network, not gh auth; (b) claude login is operator-
# interactive and independent of gh; (c) gh credential persistence
# step 6.95c is itself conditional on /root/.config/gh existing
# (which iter-5.4.0 only creates if gh auth succeeded). Net behavior:
# install + claude login always attempted; gh credentials persisted
# ONLY when they exist.

ZETA_HOME=/mnt/home/zeta

# P0 fix (PR #5388 Copilot review): resolve zeta UID/GID from the
# INSTALLED system rather than hardcoding 1000:100 — if another user
# is created first or NixOS module config changes, hardcoded IDs would
# chown files to the wrong owner.
#
# 081M3K16QKA087G0R002GT2F8X: read the installed system's account database as
# a FILE. The previous `sudo chroot /mnt id -u zeta` could never succeed on
# NixOS: a chroot resolves `id` through PATH, and every PATH entry the live ISO
# carries (/run/current-system/sw/bin, /run/wrappers/bin) is a /run path that
# does not exist inside /mnt until the installed system BOOTS -- /run is a tmpfs
# populated at activation. So every install on real metal printed the WARN
# below and guessed 1000:100. The guess happened to be right, which is exactly
# why nobody noticed that the resolution was dead.
#
# nixos-install's activation has already written /mnt/etc/passwd by the time
# this runs -- it is the same activation that created /mnt/home/zeta, which the
# block below gates on. The home directory's own ownership is the second
# witness: NixOS createHome chowns it to the user.

  # 6.95-picker — 081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69.3a cred-picker (operator interactive at setup time)
  # Operator 2026-05-27 framing: "human interactive at setup time" + "ask what declared
  # creds you want to bake in vs go through device flow".
  #
  # Runs AFTER 6.95a-bootstrap (repo + bun + mise present) and BEFORE 6.95b-* device-flow
  # logins so picker decides per-cred bake-vs-defer + the device-flow steps handle the
  # deferred subset.
  #
  # Default behavior (081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69.3c flip, 2026-05-27): AUTO-ENABLE when
  # both /etc/zeta/usb-uuid (PR #5637 closes this) and the
  # ZETA_CREDS_PASSPHRASE_VAL shell variable (populated by Step 6.56
  # prompt; held non-exported per 081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69.3b-supersede discipline) are
  # present. Explicit opt-out via ZETA_CREDS_PICKER=0 (env or
  # /etc/zeta/no-picker marker file).
  #
  # Rationale: with all 3 preconditions auto-populated by the install
  # flow, the picker becomes the operator's "don't re-enter credentials
  # over and over" solution. Backward compat preserved: any automated
  # install that doesn't want the picker can opt out via
  # ZETA_CREDS_PICKER=0 OR by NOT entering a passphrase at Step 6.56
  # (empty passphrase keeps current per-reboot re-entry behavior).
  #
  # Three opt-out paths (any one disables the picker):
  #   1. ZETA_CREDS_PICKER=0 env var
  #   2. /etc/zeta/no-picker marker file present
  #   3. Operator entered empty passphrase at Step 6.56 (no PASSPHRASE)
  #
  # SECURITY: the passphrase is FORWARDED VIA SUDO --preserve-env=ZETA_CREDS_PASSPHRASE,
  # NOT inlined in bash -c arg-string (the latter would leak the literal passphrase
  # into the process arglist visible to ps). The picker reads it via --passphrase-env
  # which references the env-var-NAME only. The env var name ZETA_CREDS_PASSPHRASE
  # is set INLINE-IN-SUDO-INVOCATION (`ZETA_CREDS_PASSPHRASE="$ZETA_CREDS_PASSPHRASE_VAL"
  # sudo --preserve-env=ZETA_CREDS_PASSPHRASE ...`) so it lives in the sudo
  # subprocess env only; the parent installer shell holds the secret in the

# which would turn the success record into an unconditional one -- a check that
# cannot fail, and the exact way this breaker would go back to being decorative.
