# Cluster install-time injection points — canonical catalog

End-to-end map of every credential / identifier / configuration value
that can be injected into a fresh NixOS install at flash time or first
console boot. Each row is declaratively backed by a NixOS module that
reads its value at evaluation time via `builtins.readFile`.

## Constitutional rail (from `usb-nixos-installer/zeta-install.sh`)

> *"Secrets shouldn't transit non-operator surfaces (USB ESP, Aaron's
> Mac keychain, etc.); operator-typed at install time is the safest
> path."*

This rail partitions injection points by **content class** + **transit
surface**:

| Content class | Allowed transit surfaces |
|---|---|
| **Public identifier** (SSH pubkey, hostname) | USB ESP at flash time; cluster console at install time |
| **Secret material** (passwords, WiFi creds, GPG, age, K8s tokens, ArgoCD admin, cosign signing key, etc.) | Cluster console at install time ONLY (operator-typed; never on USB ESP) |

Secret-class material that doesn't fit the operator-typed-once
discipline (e.g., long random tokens, multi-secret bundles) goes via
post-install secrets management (out of scope for this catalog;
candidates: SOPS, age, sealed-secrets, External Secrets Operator).

### The rail is now machine-checked (081KTWFYC9108QG0R001C8RDPK)

Until 2026-08-17 the rail above existed **only as this prose**. `FileBackedEspWrite`
in `src/Core.TypeScript/zflash/lib.ts` carried a closed union of six ESP
destinations and no notion of what class any of them held, so nothing in the
build could tell `/zeta-hostname.txt` from `/zeta-join-token`.

`src/Core.TypeScript/zflash/injection-rail.ts` makes the class a type,
**exhaustive over that same union** (`satisfies Record<EspDestination, …>`), in
the shape #11485 set for `VendorTrustRoot`: a seventh ESP destination added
without a declared content class is a TypeScript error, not a review miss.
`runFileBackedZflash` calls `railFindingsForEspWrites` and discloses every
secret-class write to the operator at flash time.

Three classes, not two — the table above cannot express why `/zeta-creds.enc`
is permitted while being called secret material. It is permitted because it is
an **encrypted envelope** whose key is not on the medium, so that is its own
class. **The class is DECLARED, never measured:** the rail does not open the
file to confirm it is an AES-256-GCM envelope.

| ESP destination | Content class | ESP verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `/zeta-authorized-keys.pub` | public identifier | permitted by class |
| `/zeta-hostname.txt` | public identifier | permitted by class |
| `/zeta-firstboot.conf` | public identifier | permitted by class |
| `/zeta-creds.enc` | encrypted envelope | permitted by class (declared, not measured) |
| `/zeta-join-token` | **secret material** | **refused by class; ships under the §6 recorded exception** |
| `/zeta-wifi-credentials.json` | **secret material** | **REFUSED — no exception on file; see §4a** |

**What is NOT claimed.** This module performs no cryptography and no key
material passes through it. Nothing here is sealed, bound, attested, or
verified. It classifies destinations and returns verdicts.

### 4a. WiFi credentials on the ESP — a divergence, not an exception

Found 2026-08-17 while making the rail machine-checkable, and recorded rather
than quietly fixed (the #11477 standard).

§4 below classifies WiFi credentials as **"Secret material (NEVER on USB ESP)"**
and says they are typed at the console into `nmtui`. **The shipping code does
otherwise.** `planFileBackedZflashImage` writes `/zeta-wifi-credentials.json` —
the SSID and the PSK as plain JSON — onto the ESP whenever `--wifi-ssid` /
`--wifi-password` / `--wifi-credentials` is passed;
`composeWifiCredentialsFileContent` validates and serialises, and performs no
encryption. Three existing tests in `file-backed.test.ts` assert that plaintext
write as expected behaviour, so the path is live, not vestigial.

This is a **divergence**, categorically different from §6's exception: §6 was
decided and written down; this was not noticed. It is left UNRESOLVED here on
purpose — removing a shipped operator flag is a maintainer call, and the
correct destination (the §7 encrypted blob, or console-only per §4) is the same
open question §6 already carries. Recorded in code as
`RAIL_DIVERGENCES` in `injection-rail.ts`, and disclosed at every flash that
carries it.

## Supported injection points (live catalog)

Each injection point has: stage (when injected) + content class +
flag/prompt (how operator drives it) + ESP filename (if ESP-transit) +
NixOS module (declarative reader) + iter/backlog tag.

### 1. Operator SSH pubkey

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **Stage** | macOS at `zflash` time → USB ESP write |
| **Content class** | Public identifier |
| **Operator-driven via** | `zflash --ssh-key <path>` (default `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`); `--no-inject` to skip |
| **ESP filename** | `zeta-authorized-keys.pub` |
| **NixOS reader module** | `full-ai-cluster/nixos/modules/operator-ssh-keys.nix` (+ `operator-authorized-keys.nix` variant) |
| **Backed by file** | `full-ai-cluster/nixos/modules/operator-ssh-keys.txt` |
| **Iter / backlog** | iter-4.2 / [081KSGS9H0008QG0R002T3BJ2R](../docs/backlog/) |
| **Reader entry point** | `builtins.readFile keysFile` → `users.users.zeta.openssh.authorizedKeys` |
| **Mechanism on Mac** | `diskutil mount` ESP + `sudo tee` write (read-only on `~/.ssh/`) |
| **Mechanism on installer** | `zeta-install.sh` probes mounted USB FAT/ESP partitions; writes file into `/mnt/etc/zeta/` (or equivalent) |

### 2. Cluster node hostname

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **Stage** | macOS at `zflash` time → USB ESP write |
| **Content class** | Public identifier (RFC1123-validated) |
| **Operator-driven via** | `zflash --host <name>` (default = flake's per-host config) |
| **ESP filename** | `zeta-hostname.txt` |
| **NixOS reader module** | `full-ai-cluster/nixos/modules/injected-hostname.nix` |
| **Backed by file** | `/mnt/etc/zeta/cluster-node-id` (written by installer from ESP) |
| **Iter / backlog** | iter-5.2 / [081KSGS9H0008QG0R003V23XNZ](../docs/backlog/) |
| **Reader entry point** | `builtins.readFile idFile` → `networking.hostName` (via `lib.mkOverride 50`) |
| **Validation** | `VALID_HOSTNAME_REGEX` in `zflash-lib.ts`; mirror grep `[a-zA-Z0-9]([a-zA-Z0-9-]*[a-zA-Z0-9])?$` in `zeta-install.sh` |

### 3. `zeta` user initial password

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **Stage** | Cluster console at install time → typed twice |
| **Content class** | **Secret material** (NEVER on USB ESP) |
| **Operator-driven via** | `read -s` prompt in `zeta-install.sh`; Enter to skip → keeps `zeta-change-me` default |
| **Hash mechanism** | `mkpasswd -m sha-512 -s` (sha512crypt; reads from stdin to avoid argv exposure) |
| **Backed by file** | `/mnt/etc/zeta/initial-hashedpassword` (chmod 0600, chown root:root) |
| **NixOS reader module** | `full-ai-cluster/nixos/modules/initial-password.nix` |
| **Iter / backlog** | iter-5.3 (+ 081KSGS9H0008QG0R00120EEHM Bug 3b runtime-injection fix) |
| **Reader entry point** | `builtins.readFile` → `users.users.zeta.hashedPassword` |
| **Why console-only** | Per constitutional rail above; password shouldn't transit Mac keychain OR USB ESP |
| **Fallback hash** | sha512crypt of `zeta-change-me` (BACKWARD-COMPAT; rotate via `passwd zeta` after first SSH login) |

### 4. WiFi credentials

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **Stage** | Cluster console at first boot → `nmtui` |
| **Content class** | **Secret material** (NEVER on USB ESP) |
| **Operator-driven via** | `nmtui` TUI on `zeta-first-boot.sh` |
| **Backed by** | NetworkManager system connections (under `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/`) |
| **Iter / backlog** | sibling exception in `zeta-first-boot.sh` (per `zeta-install.sh` line 392 comment) |
| **Why console-only** | Same constitutional rail; WiFi PSK is secret |

### 5. Node role (first control plane vs joiner)

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **Stage** | macOS/Linux at flash time → USB ESP write |
| **Content class** | Public identifier (role, flake host attribute, join endpoint) |
| **Operator-driven via** | `--role first-control-plane\|joiner` `--flake-host <attr>` `--join-server-url https://host[:port]` on the file-backed zflash CLI and `prepare-boot-image.ts` |
| **ESP filename** | `zeta-firstboot.conf` |
| **NixOS reader module** | none — the conf is read by **bash**: `zeta-first-boot.sh` sources it in preference to the ISO's `/etc/zeta-firstboot.conf`, then execs `zeta-install "$HOST"`. The join URL half is read at Nix evaluation time by `full-ai-cluster/nixos/modules/injected-join-server.nix`. |
| **Backed by file** | `/mnt/etc/zeta/cluster-join-server-url` (extracted from the conf by `zeta-install.sh`) |
| **Composer** | `src/Core.TypeScript/zflash/firstboot-role.ts` (pure; unit-tested in `firstboot-role.test.ts`) |
| **Validation** | flake host must match `VALID_FLAKE_HOST_ATTRIBUTE_REGEX`; join URL must be `https` host-and-port; **every emitted value passes `SHELL_SAFE_CONF_VALUE_REGEX` and is single-quoted**, because the file is `.`-sourced by bash |
| **Iter / backlog** | 081KSNY2Z0008QG0R0008PN7RQ scenario 5; supersedes the "per-flash `--role` deferred to v2" note in `usb-nixos-installer/nixos/installer/configuration.nix` |

**Why it exists:** before this, the role was fixed at ISO-BUILD time
(`environment.etc."zeta-firstboot.conf"` ships `HOST=control-plane`), so every
medium cut from one ISO installed a control plane and a second node could not
be provisioned as a joiner.

**UNEXERCISED.** The composer is unit-tested; the bash and Nix halves have not
been booted. See `JoinBlocker` in `src/Core.TypeScript/zflash/test-harness/scenarios.ts`.

### 5b. Cluster segment addressing — plaintext on ESP, NOT secret, but TAMPERABLE

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **Stage** | flash time → USB ESP write, inside `zeta-firstboot.conf` |
| **Content class** | Public identifiers (an IPv4 address, a prefix length, a MAC) — **not secret material** |
| **Conf keys** | `ZETA_CLUSTER_NODE_CIDR`, `ZETA_CLUSTER_SEGMENT_MAC`, `ZETA_CLUSTER_CONTROL_PLANE_IP` |
| **Composer** | `src/Core.TypeScript/zflash/cluster-address.ts` (pure; unit-tested in `cluster-address.test.ts`) |
| **Consumer** | `zeta-install.sh` re-validates and stages `/mnt/etc/zeta/cluster-segment-address`, `…-segment-mac`, `…-control-plane-address`; `nixos/modules/injected-cluster-address.nix` reads them at Nix evaluation time |
| **Validation** | derived (never free-typed): founder `.1`, joiner `.2+` in `10.88.0.0/24`; MAC must be six lowercase hex octets **and unicast**; shape re-checked independently in TypeScript, in bash, and in Nix |
| **Iter / backlog** | 081KSNY2Z0008QG0R0008PN7RQ scenario 5, `joining-node-address-assignment` |

**Why it exists:** the shared cluster segment has no DHCP server and no DNS, so
a joining node had no address and could not resolve the host in its own
`--server` URL. mDNS is not the fix — `k3s-server.nix` records that it was
tried and never resolved, and it ships only `--tls-san=control-plane`, so a
`.local` name would fail certificate verification even if it did resolve.

**HONEST CAVEAT — plaintext and tamperable, stated rather than shipped quietly.**
Unlike point 6, nothing here is secret: an address and a MAC leak nothing by
being readable. The exposure is the other direction — **anyone with physical
possession of the stick can REWRITE these values**, and the obvious attack is
repointing `ZETA_CLUSTER_CONTROL_PLANE_IP` at a rogue node so a joiner dials it.
What limits that, and what does not:

- It **does not** buy a silent takeover of the joiner. The joiner still verifies
  the API certificate against the name `control-plane`, and a rogue node cannot
  present a certificate for it without the cluster CA. The join fails rather
  than succeeding against the wrong cluster.
- It **does** buy denial of service and misdirection — a joiner sent to an
  address that answers nothing, or to a node that can now see its connection
  attempts. Neither is authenticated away by anything on the medium.
- The same physical access already reaches the point-6 join token, which is the
  strictly worse exposure. This is recorded as **not making that any better**,
  not as being safe on its own.
- The long-term home is the same one point 6 names: the AES-256-GCM cred blob
  bound to a passphrase and the USB UUID (081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69).

**UNEXERCISED.** The derivation is unit-tested with no network and no QEMU. The
`injected-cluster-address.nix` no-op path is evaluated (it yields `{}`); the
populated path, the NetworkManager keyfile pickup, MAC-based NIC selection, and
reachability of 6443 across the segment are **UNVERIFIED**. See `JoinBlocker`
in `src/Core.TypeScript/zflash/test-harness/scenarios.ts`.

### 6. k3s node-token (joiner) — plaintext on ESP, opt-in

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **Stage** | flash time → USB ESP write, **only when explicitly requested** |
| **Content class** | **Secret material, stored PLAINTEXT** — see the caveat below |
| **Operator-driven via** | `--join-token <path>` (requires `--role joiner`) |
| **ESP filename** | `zeta-join-token` |
| **Consumer** | `zeta-install.sh` copies it to `/mnt/var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/token` (0600), which is exactly the path `nixos/modules/k3s-agent.nix` sets as `services.k3s.tokenFile` |
| **Source of the value** | the founding server's `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token` |
| **Shape, enforced twice** | `K10<64 lowercase hex>::<creds>` — refused at flash time by `firstboot-role.ts` `validateJoinTokenMaterial`, and again by `zeta-install.sh` before install |

**WHY THE SHAPE IS ENFORCED AND NOT ASSUMED (traced upstream 2026-08-21).** The
`K10<hash>::` prefix is not decoration; it is the only thing authenticating the
server a joiner hands its credential to. In k3s `pkg/clientaccess/token.go`:

- `parseToken` does **not** reject a token lacking the prefix — it rewrites it
  to `K10:::<password>`, so `caHash` becomes the empty string.
- `getCACerts` downloads the cluster CA from `/cacerts` using `insecureClient`,
  declared in that same file with `tls.Config{InsecureSkipVerify: true}`.
- `validateCAHash` with an empty `caHash` and a non-empty CA bundle emits
  `logrus.Warn(...)` and returns nil — the join proceeds.

So a bare shared secret (`K3S_TOKEN=hunter2`) yields a joiner that accepts
whatever CA answers first on the segment and then presents the cluster token to
it. `https://` in the server URL does not close this: the request that ignores
TLS is the CA download itself. Refusing the shape costs a correct operator
nothing — `server/token` and its `node-token` symlink are both written by
`handlers.WriteToken` → `clientaccess.FormatToken`, which always prepends the
digest.

**CONSTITUTIONAL-RAIL CAVEAT — read before using this on real hardware.** Point
7's "Encrypted cred-blob" earns its place on the ESP by being AES-256-GCM
encrypted and bound to an operator passphrase plus the USB UUID. **This one is
not.** A k3s node-token written here sits in the clear on a FAT filesystem that
anyone with physical possession of the stick can read, and it grants cluster
membership. That is a weaker bar than the rail sets for secret material, and it
is recorded as a gap rather than argued away:

- It is **never written implicitly** — only when the operator passes `--join-token`.
- It is intended for the QEMU harness, where the token is deterministic test
  material and the "stick" is a file in `/tmp`.
- The correct long-term home is the existing encrypted blob path
  (081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69), which already has the passphrase + UUID binding
  this needs. Folding the join token into that blob is the follow-up.

### 9. Workload identity (SPIFFE) at the door — NOT SHIPPED; derivation + policy only

081KTWFYC9108QG0R001C8RDPK. What exists today is **pure derivation and policy**
in `src/Core.TypeScript/zflash/injection-rail.ts`. **No workload identity is
issued, sealed, bound, attested, or injected by anything in this repo.** No
node has been flashed or booted against any of it.

A SPIFFE workload identity is three artifacts, and only the third is what people
mean by "the key":

| Artifact | Content class | ESP verdict |
|---|---|---|
| SPIFFE ID (the URI) | public identifier | permitted |
| trust bundle (trust-domain CA **public** keys) | public identifier | permitted |
| SVID **private key** | secret material | **refused** |

The refusal has two independent reasons, either sufficient: the rail (secret
material, unencrypted medium), and SPIFFE's own design — the workload generates
its own private key and only a CSR leaves it. So the honest reading of "keys
injected at the door" is that **the key is not injected**; what can travel with
the medium is the public half and the node coordinate.

**The composition that already exists:** the hostname zflash writes to
`/zeta-hostname.txt` is exactly the `@<node>` coordinate of the identity-treaty
form (`docs/research/2026-07-03-persona-cell-identity-treaty-*` Article 3,
`spiffe://zeta/persona/<persona>/cell/<surface>[/<instance>][@<node>]`).
`deriveNodeWorkloadSpiffeId` derives it and validates by round-tripping through
`parseSpiffe` — necessary, because `VALID_HOSTNAME_REGEX` accepts uppercase and
the actor-ref segment charset does not, so `--host Node-A` flashes cleanly and
yields a SPIFFE ID this repo's own parser rejects.

**Missing injection point (candidate, not filed as a change):** the **trust
bundle** has no ESP destination. It is a public identifier, so the rail permits
it, and without a trust anchor on the medium a booting node has nothing to
verify an issuer against — first contact is TOFU. Adding an ESP destination is
key handling and therefore behind this work-item's review gate (Nazar + Mateo),
so it is named here rather than shipped.

**Custody decisions this deliberately does NOT make** (`WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_CUSTODY_DECISIONS`,
each `decided: false`, asserted by test):

1. Where an SVID private key is **sealed at rest** — TPM 2.0, Secure Enclave,
   software keystore, or nothing. (The 2026-08-14 hardware probe found no TPM
   and no usable seal tier on the Mac Studio; the x86 nodes are unprobed.)
2. Whether the node identity is **TPM-bound** — sealing and binding are separate
   choices and either can be made without the other.
3. **Who authorizes issuance** at first boot. SPIRE node attestation answers
   "which node is this" from a vendor-rooted claim; nothing here answers "and
   may it have an identity in this trust domain".
4. Which **governance class** a node workload key takes (self-sovereign /
   shared-capability / delegated-operational — taxonomy fixed by the 2026-08-14
   L0→L6 ladder, per-key assignment explicitly left to ratification).

## Operator-driven `zflash` flag inventory (current)

Allowlist from `zflash.ts`:

```text
--help / -h          show usage + exit
--ssh-key <path>     override SSH pubkey injected to ESP
                     (default: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub)
--no-inject          skip SSH pubkey injection entirely
--host <name>        inject RFC1123 hostname to ESP as zeta-hostname.txt
--skip-freshness-check
                     bypass main-vs-local divergence check
                     (NOT recommended — surfaces silent flash-without-inject hazard)
--skip-iso-pull      use the existing newest ~/Downloads/zeta-installer-*.iso
                     instead of pulling latest CI artifact
--agent              authorized-agent mode (auto-types `yes <nonce>` challenge;
                     operator's Touch ID still gates the dd)
```

## In-flight injection points (substrate-engineering targets — not yet shipped)

### 7. Encrypted cred-blob on USB ESP (081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69 Phase 1, in-flight)

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **Stage** | Cluster console at install time → encrypted blob persisted to USB ESP after successful auth (post-install service trigger) |
| **Content class** | **Secret material** (encrypted-at-rest; key never hits disk) |
| **Operator-driven via** | Boot-sequence auth-method picker (4 options: restore-from-blob / fresh-device-flow / operator-PAT / skip) + operator passphrase |
| **Encryption** | AES-256-GCM; key derived via 2-layer scrypt → HKDF chain (full mechanism + parameters below) |
| **ESP filenames** | `/esp/zeta-creds.enc` (encrypted) + `/esp/zeta-creds-manifest.yaml` (declarative + operator-readable) |
| **Backlog** | [081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69](../docs/backlog/P1/081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69-credential-persistence-on-usb-esp-plus-boot-sequence-auth-method-picker-encrypted-blob-bound-to-usb-uuid-plus-operator-passphrase-aaron-2026-05-27.md) (P1, open, M-effort) |
| **Covers credentials** | per declarative manifest: `gh-cli` (`~/.config/gh/hosts.yml`), `claude` (per-persona), `gemini` (per-persona), `codex` (per-persona), `ssh-host-keys`, `ssh-operator-pubkey` |
| **Constitutional-rail compliance** | Secret material; encrypted-at-rest on ESP IS allowed because the operator-passphrase + USB-UUID binding means the ESP-stored blob is useless without operator presence — the consent floor stays at operator-typed passphrase, not at USB-physical possession alone |

#### KDF chain detail (mechanism + parameters)

The 32-byte AES-256-GCM key is derived in two layers; full implementation in `tools/installer/zeta-creds-crypto.ts` (the `deriveKey` function + the `SCRYPT_*` + `KEY_LEN` + `SALT_LEN` + `HKDF_INFO` constants declared near the top of the file).

**Layer 1 — scrypt** (memory-hard work-factor KDF):

```text
stretched = scrypt(passphrase, salt, length=32, N=2^17, r=8, p=1, maxmem=256MB)
```

scrypt does NOT increase the underlying entropy of the operator passphrase (a weak passphrase remains weak in information-theoretic terms). What scrypt provides is a tunable **work-factor cost** per guess: with the parameters below, each candidate passphrase requires ~128MB of memory and (empirically per `zeta-creds-crypto.ts` Layer 1 source comments, on the maintainer's modern CPU at parameter-selection time) ~1-2 seconds of CPU per derivation. This makes brute-force attacks memory-prohibitively expensive on GPU/ASIC (per the 2026-05-27 security-review HIGH finding documented in the source: HKDF alone assumes high-entropy IKM, which user-typed passphrases violate; scrypt is the layer that makes the IKM cryptographically suitable for HKDF input).

Parameter selection: `N=2^17`, `r=8`, `p=1` — per [OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#scrypt) recommended scrypt parameters (current at parameter-selection time 2026-05-27; bump procedure: visit the cheat sheet at next security-review cadence, update both the cheat-sheet-citation date here AND the `SCRYPT_N`/`SCRYPT_R`/`SCRYPT_P` constants in `zeta-creds-crypto.ts`). Per-machine operational cost will vary with CPU + memory bandwidth; the ~1-2s figure is anchored to the source-code comment's empirical timing context.

**Layer 2 — HKDF-SHA256** (binds key to USB UUID):

```text
ikm  = concat(usbUuid_utf8, "|", stretched)
key  = HKDF-SHA256(ikm, salt, info="zeta-b0852-cred-persistence-v1", length=32)
```

HKDF binds the stretched secret to the USB UUID via IKM concatenation. Wrong USB → different IKM → different HKDF output → AES-GCM auth tag verification fails → structured error returned (not garbled plaintext). Defends against copy-blob-to-different-USB attack (operator-named threat 2026-05-27: *"we can put a key on the usb too if wnated tied to the uuid so it can't be copied to uuid"*).

Both layers must reproduce identically at decrypt time for the AES-GCM auth tag to verify; salt is per-blob (generated at encrypt time; stored in envelope; required at decrypt).

### 8. GitHub-creds-at-flash-time variants (081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69 picker options 1 + 3)

Per operator 2026-05-27 verbatim: *"the current ones on my machine OR a token i generate on the website."*

Maps directly to 081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69 Sub-target 2 (boot-sequence auth-method picker):

| Picker option | Operator-driven via | Credential source | Constitutional-rail compliance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Option 1: Restore from encrypted USB blob** | Operator passphrase at boot picker prompt; default when blob present | Previously-persisted operator Mac `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml` (encrypted into the blob on prior boot's successful auth) | Encrypted-at-rest; operator-passphrase-derived key |
| **Option 2: Fresh device-flow login** | Operator visits github.com on phone/browser to enter device code | gh CLI device-flow (current behavior; uses gh-CLI quota) | Operator-driven directly; no transit issue |
| **Option 3: Operator-provided PAT** | Operator pastes fine-grained PAT at prompt (created at github.com/settings/tokens) | Operator-typed at cluster console | Typed once; same rail as initial-password |
| **Option 4: Skip** | Operator presses Enter at picker | (no GitHub-side substrate) | Cluster operates degraded; no inject |

## Architectural-principle layer — USB self-healing direction on reformat (operator 2026-05-27)

Operator 2026-05-27 verbatim:

> *"this makes the usb move in the self healing instead of full wipe direction on reformat"*

Substrate-engineering principle: when 081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69 lands, **the DEFAULT behavior on USB reformat = preserve previous keys + choices** (081KSKBP80008QG0R00146WEX1's reformat-with-current-keys mode). Full-wipe (new-keys + new-decisions) becomes the OPT-IN path, not the default.

Three-mode reformat substrate (per [081KSKBP80008QG0R00146WEX1](../docs/backlog/P1/081KSKBP80008QG0R00146WEX1-post-boot-ai-as-home-owner-not-controlled-runtime-every-knob-from-first-boot-aaron-2026-05-27.md)):

| Mode | What it does | Default? |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Boot off USB again (fix mode)** | Substrate diagnoses + repairs broken state on cluster machines | Always available |
| **2. Reformat with current keys + decisions** | Wipe cluster machine; reflash from USB; restore previously-persisted creds + architectural decisions | **DEFAULT post-081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69** |
| **3. Full reflash with new decisions + keys** | Wipe cluster machine; reflash from USB; generate new creds + start fresh architectural state | Opt-in (fresh-identity case) |

This direction-of-default matters because:

- **AI worry-about-mistakes dissolves** when reformat preserves identity (per 081KSKBP80008QG0R00146WEX1 operational-freedom mechanism)
- **Operator re-flash workflow becomes lower-friction** (the common case = preserve; the rare case = wipe)
- **Cred-leak / identity-corruption recovery stays available** via mode 3 opt-in (not default)
- **Self-healing direction composes with operator's persistent-recovery vision**: 3-machine quorum + remote-KVM + remote-power-button-press (per 081KSKBP80008QG0R00146WEX1) means substrate survives as long as ONE of {any cluster machine, the USB, operator's re-flash ability} survives

Operator's substrate-honest acknowledgment 2026-05-27: *"i know you can't preserve what i have now but for the next time would be cool"* — current ISO (`fd0ca0c8b` 25.11 Xantusia) doesn't yet ship 081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69; this catalog tracks the direction for when it does. Today's flash IS full-wipe-default (because mode 2 doesn't exist yet); next flash post-081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69 IS preserve-default.

## Remaining gaps (no backlog row yet — candidates per constitutional rail)

Substrate-engineering targets NOT covered by 081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69 or sibling rows.
Each new credential-type filing should walk the constitutional-rail
decision before authoring: **public identifier → ESP allowed; secret
material → console or post-install secrets management only**.

When 081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69 ships, secret-class additions become MANIFEST EDITS
(declarative; new entry in `/esp/zeta-creds-manifest.yaml`) rather than
new code. Per Aaron 2026-05-27 in 081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69: *"the keep credentials options
we should declare each credential we need and save and restore so it's
not so imparative too."* Adding a new cred type post-081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69 = one YAML
entry; the persist/restore code reads the manifest + iterates.

| Candidate | Content class | Likely transit (post-081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GPG signing key (operator) | Secret | 081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69 manifest extension | Per constitutional rail |

| Cosign signing key (cluster-issued) | Secret | Post-install secrets mgmt | For artifact signing |
| Cluster TLS root CA | Secret | Post-install secrets mgmt | For internal-CA bootstrap |
| Tailscale / WireGuard auth key | Secret | 081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69 manifest extension | For overlay-network bootstrap |
| Time-server NTP override | Public config | USB ESP at flash time (candidate) | Cheap; non-secret |
| Locale / timezone | Public config | USB ESP at flash time (candidate) | Cheap; non-secret |
| Per-node disk role hints | Public config | USB ESP at flash time (candidate) | Currently in flake per-host config |
| **GHCR pull token (`zeta-platform/ghcr-pull`)** | **Secret** | **Cluster console at install time, OR retired entirely by making the packages public** | **Live blocker, not a candidate — see below** |

### The GHCR pull token is the first entry here that is BLOCKING something today

Every other row above is a target. This one names why the metal platform control
plane has never started, and it is recorded here because the constitutional rail
already decides how it would have to arrive.

**Measured 2026-08-22.** `ghcr.io/lucent-financial-group/zeta-platform-controller`
and `.../zeta-portal` are both `visibility: private` (36 published versions each,
built by `.github/workflows/build-platform-images.yml`). An anonymous manifest GET
returns HTTP 401; a credentialed one returns 200. The pods therefore take
`ImagePullBackOff` on **every** substrate, and ArgoCD reports that as
`Progressing` rather than `Degraded`, so nothing ever went red about it.

**The dev/CI half is now wired** — `applyDevRegistryPullSecret` mints
`zeta-platform/ghcr-pull` at bring-up from a token in the environment, and both
pod specs reference it. CI can do this because a workflow already holds a token.

**Metal cannot**, and that is the finding worth stating plainly against the
standing goal that hardware comes up with no manual step:

> A registry pull token is **secret material** under the rail at the top of this
> file, so its only sanctioned transit is **operator-typed at the cluster console
> at install time** (or, later, the encrypted cred-blob of
> 081KSKBP80008QG0R003AX2A69). There is no path by which an unattended node
> obtains it. **So as long as these packages are private, unattended metal
> bring-up of `platform` is not achievable** — not for want of automation, but
> because the node has no way to hold a credential nobody gave it.

**The exit that removes the requirement rather than satisfying it** is making the
two packages public, after which `imagePullSecrets` becomes inert and metal needs
no credential at all. That is a **disclosure decision and it is the maintainer's
alone** — it is recorded here as the alternative, not advocated. The two options
are genuinely different trades: operator-typed keeps the images closed and costs a
manual step per cluster; public costs disclosure and buys unattended bring-up.

## Substrate-engineering composition

- 081KSGS9H0008QG0R002T3BJ2R (iter-4.2 SSH pubkey injection)
- 081KSGS9H0008QG0R003V23XNZ (iter-5.2 hostname injection)
- 081KSGS9H0008QG0R00120EEHM (initial-password runtime activation fix)
- 081KSKBP80008QG0R0039RW25E (streams-are-relationships substrate — each injection-point pipeline is a tiny typed function per the distribute-across-tiny-functions architectural principle)

## Composes with rules

- `.claude/rules/non-coercion-invariant.md` HC-8 — secret-class material requires operator-typed consent at the cluster console; ESP-transit for non-public secrets would violate HC-8 floor
- `.claude/rules/glass-halo-bidirectional.md` — each injection mechanism is type-visible; operator can inspect every path
- `.claude/rules/honor-those-that-came-before.md` — iter-4.2 / 5.2 / 5.3 substrate preserved + named in catalog
- `.claude/rules/verify-existing-substrate-before-authoring.md` — this catalog is the substrate-inventory pass for future credential-type additions
