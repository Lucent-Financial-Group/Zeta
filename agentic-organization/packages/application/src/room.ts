/**
 * Room — an ephemeral, deterministic-simulation container that hosts hats and
 * injects either real or mock IO interfaces at every seam.
 *
 * A room is "simple RISC-like micro-operations before execution": you bind the
 * seams (real or mock), seat the hats, declare the budget, then step. Same
 * inputs -> same trace (DST). Its `roomId` is content-addressed (ZetaId-shaped)
 * and IS its Reticulum destination, so a room is a first-class mesh endpoint and
 * cross-room messages route to `roomId`.
 *
 * Every agent lives in a room — including the ephemeral observe.ts agents. A
 * room is the per-agent isolation boundary: a bwrap sandbox plus a credential
 * proxy bound to the agent's OAuth identity. The agent holds no raw secrets; it
 * goes through observe.ts, which invokes the credential proxy to turn a chosen
 * slot into a scoped, allowed tool grant.
 *
 * Design: ../../docs/ROOMS_AS_DETERMINISTIC_SIMULATIONS.md
 * Seam discipline: real seams do real I/O; the mock seam substitutes a
 * deterministic double at the SAME boundary (Feathers' seam, made universal —
 * see docs/research/2026-06-07-test-seam-deterministic-simulation-of-all-nouns-and-verbs).
