/**
 * infra/k8s/tests/validate-applications.test.ts
 *
 * MUTATION SUITE — proves `validate-applications.ts` can go RED.
 *
 * A green check is worth nothing until someone has watched it fail. On
 * 2026-08-14 this repo found five separate checks that could not fail, and
 * the previous version of the validator under test was one of them: it
 * reported `PASS: valid YAML` on a manifest containing a tab-indented line
 * and an unterminated quote, and `44 passed, 0 failed` on a chart pinned to
 * version 999.999.999.
 *
 * So each case here takes the REAL manifest tree, copies it to a temp dir,
 * applies ONE mutation, runs the validator as a subprocess, and asserts
 * BOTH that the exit code is 1 AND that the specific expected reason is in
 * the output. The exit code alone is not enough — a script can exit 1 for
 * the wrong reason (an argument-parsing error, a missing file) and still
 * look like a working check.
 *
 * `control` runs the UNMUTATED copy and asserts exit 0. Without it, a
 * validator that failed unconditionally would pass every other case here.
 *
 * All cases run `--offline`: no network, deterministic, and comfortably
 * inside bun's effective 5000 ms per-test cap (see bunfig.toml).
