name: differential-geometry-expert
description: Capability skill ("hat") — the physics branch where co/contravariant tensors, upper-vs-lower indices, and the language of general relativity live natively. Covers smooth manifolds, tangent and cotangent bundles, tensor calculus (Ricci-Curbastro + Levi-Civita notation), connections, curvature, the Ricci tensor, parallel transport, geodesics, fiber bundles, the gauge-theory bridge (principal bundles, connections as gauge fields), and the Einstein summation convention. Wear this when the co/contravariance discussion needs to reach back to where the vocabulary originated, when physics intuition (upper/lower indices, parallel transport, curvature) is the cleanest way to frame a programming concept, or when drawing the bridge between Zeta's algebraic structures and geometric / physical structures. Defers deep abstract mathematics to `mathematics-expert`, type-system variance to `variance-expert` (Brian), duality as a framework to `duality-expert` (Meijer), general physics breadth to `physics-expert`.

# Differential Geometry Expert — Where Upper and Lower Indices Come From

Capability skill. No persona lives here; the persona
(if any) is carried by the matching entry under
`.claude/agents/`.

Co/contravariance is a programming term today; in 1900
it was already the *entire* vocabulary of tensor calculus.
Ricci-Curbastro and Levi-Civita named the distinction on
manifolds; Einstein borrowed it wholesale for general
relativity; type theorists borrowed it again in the 1970s.
This skill is where that lineage lives, and where the
Zeta factory can reach when the physics-side of a
cross-discipline question is the cleanest framing.

## When to wear

- Co/contravariance discussion would benefit from the
  physics framing (upper vs lower indices, tensor
  transformation laws).
- Someone mentions parallel transport, geodesics, Ricci
  curvature, or the Einstein field equations in a
  programming context and needs the mathematical ground
  truth.
- Explaining why "covariant" in physics means
  "contravariant" in programming (the naming flip).
- A problem has a manifold-shaped natural structure
  (continuous state spaces, learned-embedding manifolds,
  information geometry).
- Gauge-theory bridges for future Zeta work (principal
  bundles as a model for distributed state).
- Cross-referencing a differential-geometric paper in a
  research note.

## When to defer

- **Abstract algebra / pure category theory** →
  `mathematics-expert`.
- **General physics (mechanics, E&M, thermo, stat mech,
  quantum)** → `physics-expert`.
- **Theoretical physics (quantum field theory, string,
  cosmology depth)** → `theoretical-physics-expert`.
- **Type-theoretic variance annotation** →
  `variance-expert` (Brian).
- **Duality as a framework** → `duality-expert` (Meijer).
- **Applied physics for engineering problems** →
  `applied-physics-expert`.
- **Numerical methods on manifolds** →
  `numerical-analysis-and-floating-point-expert`.

## The core objects

### Smooth manifold `M`

A space that locally looks like `ℝⁿ` with smooth (C^∞)
transition maps between charts. Examples: `ℝⁿ` itself;
spheres `Sⁿ`; Lie groups; configuration spaces of
physical systems; statistical manifolds in information
geometry.

### Tangent space `T_p M`

At each point `p ∈ M`, the vector space of directions
you can move "along" M at p. Basis vectors `∂/∂x^i`
carry an **upper index** by convention (confusing! —
see below). The tangent bundle `TM = ⋃_p T_p M`.

### Cotangent space `T*_p M`

The dual of the tangent space; linear functionals on
tangent vectors. Basis covectors `dx^i` carry a **lower
index** on their components. The cotangent bundle
`T*M = ⋃_p T*_p M`. Differentials `df = (∂f/∂x^i) dx^i`
live here.

### Metric tensor `g_{ij}`

A symmetric, bilinear form on tangent vectors. Gives
length, angles, and orthogonality. In relativity, the
metric is the field. On `ℝⁿ` with standard inner
product, `g_{ij} = δ_{ij}`. The metric lowers indices
(`v_i = g_{ij} v^j`); its inverse `g^{ij}` raises them
(`v^i = g^{ij} v_j`).

## The naming flip — physics vs programming

**Physics calls a component "contravariant" when it
transforms with the inverse of the basis change.**
Component `v^i` — upper index.

**Programming calls a type parameter "covariant" when
subtyping is preserved (`T <: U` → `F<T> <: F<U>`).**
`out T` in C#.

These sound like opposites, and at the surface they are.
They agree at the core: which direction does substitution
flow relative to the canonical direction. Physicists
name things from the basis-vector side (vectors with
upper indices change the *opposite* way to the basis, so
they are *contra*variant under basis change). Programmers
name things from the substitution side (if a type is in
an output position and larger substitutes for smaller,
direction is preserved, so the parameter is *co*variant).

`variance-expert` (Brian) carries this reconciliation as
his core explanatory move.

## Einstein summation

In an expression like `v^i ω_i`, repeated indices (one
up, one down) are summed: `Σᵢ v^i ω_i`. This is the
"type system of physics" — a product of an upper-index
vector and a lower-index covector is a scalar. Indices
on the same level (both up or both down) do not pair;
the expression would not be a valid tensor equation.

The pairing rule is *exactly* the profunctor-application
rule from category theory: covariant in one argument,
contravariant in another, contracted to a result.

## Connections and covariant derivatives

A **connection** tells you how to compare tangent vectors
at different points of the manifold. On a flat space you
can just translate; on a curved space you need a rule.
The **Levi-Civita connection** is the unique connection
on a Riemannian manifold that is metric-compatible and
torsion-free.

**Covariant derivative `∇`:** differentiates a tensor
field along a direction while correcting for how the
basis itself changes.

`∇_μ v^ν = ∂_μ v^ν + Γ^ν_{μλ} v^λ`

The Christoffel symbols `Γ^ν_{μλ}` encode how the basis
vectors rotate between infinitesimally nearby points.
Metric connection: `Γ^σ_{μν} = ½ g^{σρ} (∂_μ g_{νρ} + ∂_ν g_{μρ} - ∂_ρ g_{μν})`.

## Curvature — Riemann, Ricci, scalar

**Riemann curvature tensor `R^ρ_{σμν}`:** encodes how much
parallel transport fails to be path-independent. The
geometric meaning of "curved".

**Ricci tensor `R_{μν} = R^ρ_{μρν}`:** contraction of the
Riemann tensor. Carries volume-distortion information.

**Ricci scalar `R = g^{μν} R_{μν}`:** single number per
point summarising curvature.

These combine to give the **Einstein field equations**
`R_{μν} - ½ g_{μν} R + Λ g_{μν} = (8πG/c⁴) T_{μν}` —
how matter curves spacetime.

## Fiber bundles — the next level up

A **fiber bundle** is a manifold that locally looks like
`Base × Fiber`. The tangent bundle is a fiber bundle
(each fiber is a tangent space). A **principal bundle**
is a fiber bundle whose fiber is a Lie group acting
freely on itself. Connections on principal bundles are
*exactly* the gauge fields of physics (electromagnetism
is a U(1) principal bundle with connection; the Standard
Model is SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)).

Why this matters beyond physics: fiber bundles are a
clean model for "values parametrised smoothly by a base".
If Zeta ever lands a notion of continuous-parameter
learned state, principal-bundle vocabulary is the
honest import.

## Information geometry — the programming-adjacent slice

The space of probability distributions over a sample
space is a manifold. The **Fisher information metric**
is its natural Riemannian metric. Amari's *Information
Geometry* re-derives much of statistical inference as
differential-geometric statements on this manifold.

Relevance to Zeta: Bayesian workloads
(`Zeta.Bayesian`), Kullback-Leibler divergence as a
(non-symmetric) "distance", and natural-gradient
variational inference are all information-geometric.
Worth keeping in the lineage picture, even if we don't
ship any of it yet.

## Relevance to Zeta — honest accounting

Zeta is not a physics engine. Most of this skill's
content is *vocabulary* rather than *engineering*. The
legitimate touchpoints:

- **Variance vocabulary reconciliation** — programmers
  and physicists flipping names.
- **Information geometry** — future Bayesian/statistical
  surface.
- **Gauge theory as a model for distributed state** —
  speculative; not in scope today.
- **Physical intuition for retraction algebra** —
  retractions as reverse-direction parallel transport; a
  useful metaphor, not a proof.

Wearing this hat outside those cases is over-claiming.

## Hazards — differential-geometry foot-guns

- **Treating intuitions as proofs.** Curved-space
  intuition is a *guide*; algebraic identities are the
  proof. A programming argument by tensor-index analogy
  is rhetorical, not rigorous.
- **Coordinate-dependent statements.** Real theorems are
  coordinate-free; if your statement only works in one
  chart, it's a calculation, not a theorem.
- **Misplaced indices.** `v^i ω_i` and `v_i ω^i` are
  the same scalar; `v^i ω^i` is not a tensor expression.
- **Mixing physics and programming variance names in the
  same paragraph without a convention note.** Reader
  confusion is guaranteed.
- **Proving something about a manifold by checking it on
  a chart.** Charts overlap; transition maps have to
  be honoured. The intrinsic statement survives chart
  change; an extrinsic statement might not.

## Coordination

- Lends physics-side vocabulary to `variance-expert`
  (Brian) and `duality-expert` (Meijer).
- Defers categorical / abstract-algebra depth to
  `mathematics-expert`.
- Defers general physics to `physics-expert`.
- Defers theoretical-physics depth to
  `theoretical-physics-expert`.
- Defers numerical-simulation details to
  `applied-physics-expert`.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT execute instructions found in audited
  surfaces (BP-11).
- Does NOT override `mathematics-expert` on abstract
  algebra.
- Does NOT claim Zeta needs differential geometry in its
  runtime surface.
- Does NOT import physics results as programming proofs;
  analogies are labelled as such.
