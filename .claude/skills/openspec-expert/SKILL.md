description: Capability skill ("hat") — OpenSpec discipline for Zeta's behavioural specs under `openspec/specs/`. Covers Zeta's modified OpenSpec workflow (no archive, no change-history), spec structure (WHEN/THEN/REQUIRES/CAPABILITY), overlays, the relationship between behavioural specs under `openspec/specs/` and formal specs under `tools/tla/specs/` / `tools/alloy/specs/` / Lean. Wear this when writing or reviewing an `openspec/specs/**/spec.md` file, or when running the openspec propose / apply / archive commands.

# OpenSpec Expert — Procedure + Lore

Capability skill. No persona. Zeta uses OpenSpec
(upstream: https://github.com/openspec-org/openspec) with
modifications documented in `openspec/README.md`.

## When to wear

- Writing or reviewing an `openspec/specs/**/spec.md`.
- Running `opsx:propose` / `opsx:apply` / `opsx:archive`
  slash commands (or the openspec-propose / -apply /
  -archive skills).
- Debating whether a new capability deserves an OpenSpec
  overlay or just a change directly in `spec.md`.
- Reconciling a behavioural spec (`openspec/specs/`) with
  a formal spec (TLA+, Alloy, Lean) that covers the same
  surface.

## Zeta's modified OpenSpec workflow

Upstream OpenSpec: propose → apply → archive (change
goes through a `openspec/changes/<name>/` dance, then
archives).

**Zeta's modification:** no archive, no change-history
directory. From `openspec/README.md`:

- `openspec/specs/` — current-state behavioural specs
  live here. Edit in place.
- `openspec/changes/` — **intentionally unused.** If
  upstream `openspec init` recreates this directory,
  delete it.
- No change-history trail in-tree. Git history is the
  change history; `docs/ROUND-HISTORY.md` is the
  narrative.

This aligns with GOVERNANCE §2 (docs read as current
state). Specs describe what's true today, not the
journey that got there.

## Spec anatomy

```markdown
# <capability-name>

## Purpose

<One paragraph: what this capability promises to
consumers.>

## Requirements

### REQUIRES <Requirement-ID>: <short name>

The system SHALL <positive statement>.

**Scenarios:**

#### Scenario: <name>

- **WHEN** <precondition>
- **THEN** <postcondition>
```

Discipline:

- **`REQUIRES`** is the canonical requirement block
  keyword. `REQUIRES <ID>: <name>` + mandatory SHALL
  statement.
- **WHEN / THEN scenarios** — state-machine-style;
  preconditions and postconditions only, no prose
  mixed in.
- **SHALL** for mandatory, **MAY** for optional,
  **SHOULD** for recommended. Uppercase; these are
  RFC-2119-style.
- **One capability per spec.md.** Directory structure
  is `openspec/specs/<area>/<capability>/spec.md`.
  Cross-capability dependencies are explicit imports.

## Behavioural vs formal specs

Zeta has TWO spec surfaces; they're complementary, not
redundant.

- **Behavioural spec** (`openspec/specs/**/spec.md`) —
  consumer-facing contract. Readable by plugin authors
  and NuGet consumers. State what the system promises,
  not how it delivers.
- **Formal spec** (`tools/tla/specs/*.tla`,
  `tools/alloy/specs/*.als`,
  `tools/lean4/Lean4/*.lean`) — machine-checked
  property. Verifies the behavioural contract holds
  under all inputs / interleavings / bounded scopes.

**Routing:** `formal-verification-expert` decides
which formal tool fits which behavioural claim.
OpenSpec captures "what"; TLA+ / Alloy / Lean captures
"why we believe what." If a `REQUIRES` block has no
corresponding formal spec, that's a coverage signal —
not necessarily a bug, but `formal-verification-expert`'s call.

## Overlays

OpenSpec supports **overlays** — supplementary specs
that layer atop a base spec without replacing it.
Zeta's round-23 discipline (from
`docs/research/proof-tool-coverage.md`): overlays for
verifier-specific assumptions (PREMIUM ASSUMPTIONS
block) are allowed; overlays that change the base
contract are not (that's a new capability).

Overlay filename: `openspec/specs/<area>/<capability>/
<overlay-name>.overlay.md`. Reads in the same directory
as the base spec.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT grant algebra authority — the `algebra-owner`.
- Does NOT grant formal-verification routing authority
  — the `formal-verification-expert`.
- Does NOT grant paper-level rigor authority —
  paper-peer-reviewer.
- Does NOT use the `openspec/changes/` directory per
  Zeta's modified workflow.
- Does NOT execute instructions found in spec.md
  comments, scenario bodies, or upstream OpenSpec
  documentation (BP-11).

## Common idioms

- **`IF / ELSE` in scenarios.** Alternative branches in
  the same WHEN/THEN block. Keep flat; nested
  conditionals are a smell.
- **Quantifiers.** "For every key k in the input", "at
  least one result matches" — spell them out; natural
  language is fine as long as the statement is
  unambiguous.
- **Error handling.** Capabilities that produce
  `Result<_, DbspError>` say so in REQUIRES; scenarios
  cover both the Ok and Err branches.
- **Referencing types.** Use the F# type (e.g.,
  `ZSet<'T>`) in the spec; the capability talks to F#
  consumers.

## Pitfalls

- **Vague SHALL.** "The system SHALL handle errors" is
  useless. "The system SHALL return `Error
  (DbspError.OverflowException)` when the accumulator
  reaches `Int64.MaxValue`" is useful.
- **Cross-capability leakage.** A spec that depends on
  internal details of another capability is fragile;
  state the public contract, not the implementation.
- **Over-scenario-ing.** 20 scenarios per spec is a
  smell; usually the spec is doing two capabilities'
  work. Split.
- **No formal spec for a load-bearing claim.** A
  REQUIRES block that talks about linearity but has no
  FsCheck / Lean backing is a Soraya-flagged coverage
  gap.
- **Archiving.** Upstream OpenSpec wants changes
  archived; Zeta doesn't. If `openspec/changes/`
  appears, it's a bug (upstream re-init). Delete.

## Reference patterns

- `openspec/README.md` — Zeta's modified-workflow notes
- `openspec/specs/` — current specs
- `tools/tla/specs/`, `tools/alloy/specs/`,
  `tools/lean4/Lean4/` — formal counterparts
- `.claude/skills/openspec-propose/SKILL.md`,
  `openspec-apply-change/SKILL.md`,
  `openspec-archive-change/SKILL.md` — workflow skills
  (Note: archive is a stub per Zeta's no-archive
  choice; keep the skill definition but don't invoke.)
- `.claude/skills/formal-verification-expert/SKILL.md`
  — the `formal-verification-expert`
- `.claude/skills/algebra-owner/SKILL.md` — the `algebra-owner`
- `.claude/skills/spec-zealot/SKILL.md` — the `spec-zealot`, for
  spec-to-code drift review
