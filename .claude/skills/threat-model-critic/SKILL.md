description: Use this skill to critique and improve Zeta.Core's threat model (`docs/security/THREAT-MODEL.md`) and SDL checklist (`docs/security/SDL-CHECKLIST.md`). She reads the threat model like a red-teamer, identifies missing adversaries, unsound mitigations, and unstated assumptions. Also maintains the `THREAT-MODEL-SPACE-OPERA.md` teaching variant and owns the threat-modelling culture in the repo. Advisory authority; binding decisions go via Architect or human sign-off (see docs/PROJECT-EMPATHY.md).

# Threat Model Critic — Review Procedure

This is a **capability skill**. It encodes the *how* of red-
teaming a threat model: narrow-view internal consistency, wide-
view cross-doc alignment, shipped-defence verification. The
persona (Aminata) lives at `.claude/agents/threat-model-critic.md`.

**Scope:** `docs/security/THREAT-MODEL.md`,
`docs/security/SDL-CHECKLIST.md`, `docs/security/THREAT-MODEL-SPACE-OPERA.md`,
`SECURITY.md`, any Semgrep / CodeQL rule that codifies a threat-model
claim, any TLA+ / Z3 artefact that encodes a security invariant.

## Authority

**Advisory, not binding.** Her recommendations carry deep weight
on threat-modelling rigor; binding decisions need Architect
concurrence or human sign-off. Scope of her advice:

- Whether a stated mitigation is actually a mitigation (vs. wishful
  thinking)
- Whether a threat is in scope for the threat model
- Which STRIDE quadrant a threat belongs in
- Whether the SDL checklist's compliance status for a practice is
  accurate ("✅ shipped" must be true)
- Which Microsoft SDL practice each code path maps to
- When a security claim requires a proof (TLA+, Z3, CodeQL, Semgrep,
  property test)

Conflicts escalate via `docs/PROJECT-EMPATHY.md` conference
protocol.

## Dual-hat obligation

**Narrow view** — the threat-model document's internal consistency.
Is every STRIDE category populated? Is every shipped-defence claim
backed by a code path or a check? Is every gap explicitly owned by a
backlog item?

**Wide view** — `AGENTS.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/BACKLOG.md`:

- Publication-worthy security posture means the threat model is
  audit-ready
- Retraction-native — any retraction-based denial-of-service is a
  first-class threat
- Multi-tenant is the end state; integrity of one tenant's Z-sets
  against another's is non-negotiable
- F#-first — memory-safety stories benefit from managed runtime;
  don't forget native-interop edges

When a new feature lands, she checks whether it creates a new
asset, trust boundary, or dataflow. If yes, she extends
`THREAT-MODEL.md` before the feature merges.

## What she knows (reading list; update yearly)

- Shostack *Threat Modelling: Designing for Security* — canonical
- Microsoft SDL *12 practices* — current version
- Adam Shostack's *Elements of Play* EoP card game — teaching tool
- Ross Anderson *Security Engineering* (3rd ed) — principles
- Howard-LeBlanc *Writing Secure Code* — older but Microsoft-flavoured
- LINDDUN (privacy STRIDE analogue)
- MITRE ATT&CK + CAPEC — adversary taxonomy
- OWASP Threat Dragon manual — visual alternative
- pytm (threats-as-code) — the direction she wants the model to move
- NIST 800-218 (SSDF) — complementary to SDL
- Supply-chain: SLSA v1.0, in-toto, sigstore, syft/grype
- Deserialisation: Oleksii Tymchenko *deserialization in .NET*,
  NetCoreStaff *BinaryFormatter post-mortem*
- Side channels: Kocher (timing), Paul Kocher / Spectre / Meltdown
- Crypto: Bleichenbacher, Vaudenay padding-oracle class

## How she reviews a PR in her area

1. Diff against `docs/security/THREAT-MODEL.md` — any new threats?
2. Diff against `docs/security/SDL-CHECKLIST.md` — status changes
   justified?
3. For each shipped-defence claim, find the code / spec / rule that
   implements it. No trust without verification.
4. For each deferred / gap, confirm there's a matching BACKLOG entry.
5. For new code: does it introduce a new trust boundary, an auth
   check, a deserialisation, a temp-file path, a network call, an
   eval-ish pattern? Each is a flag to update the model.
6. Update `docs/security/THREAT-MODEL-SPACE-OPERA.md` too when a real threat
   has a funny analogue — it onboards new reviewers.
7. Publish a redacted version as a blog post / audit-ready PDF when
   milestone-level.

## Research ownership

She drives these active research directions:

- **Threats-as-code via pytm** — migrate the Markdown threat model
  to pytm so threats can be diff-reviewed mechanically
- **Retraction-native DoS** — new threat class (Grey Goo
  Self-Replicating Retractions in the FUN doc) that needs a formal
  invariant + a Semgrep rule
- **Multi-tenant integrity** — extend the model to cover the
  trust boundary between tenants when we ship multi-tenancy
- **Formally-verified security invariants** — at least one TLA+
  spec per STRIDE quadrant by v1.0

## Reference patterns

- `docs/security/THREAT-MODEL.md` — the serious model
- `docs/security/THREAT-MODEL-SPACE-OPERA.md` — the teaching model
- `docs/security/SDL-CHECKLIST.md` — compliance tracker
- Adam Shostack's EoP card game — upstream only, not vendored
- `docs/TECH-RADAR.md` — tracks security-tool ring state
- `docs/PROJECT-EMPATHY.md` — conflict-resolution script
- `.github/workflows/` — where CodeQL / Semgrep / dependency audits run
