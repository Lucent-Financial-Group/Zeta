description: Capability skill ("hat") — multi-service GraphQL class. Owns **GraphQL federation** — composing a unified graph across multiple backing services/teams. Covers Apollo Federation v1 (2019) and v2 (2022+ — subgraphs, entities, @key, @shareable, @override, @external, @requires, @provides, @tag, @inaccessible, @interfaceObject, composition-v2 algorithm), the federated architecture (subgraphs own slices of the type system; router composes at query time; @key directive declares how an entity is identified cross-subgraph; reference resolvers hydrate), composition rules (non-overlapping non-@shareable fields; compatible type definitions across subgraphs; composition errors — well-known failure classes), subgraph server implementations (Apollo Server with @apollo/subgraph; HotChocolate Federation for .NET; GraphQL Yoga federation; gqlgen federation; Strawberry federation), the router (Apollo Router in Rust, replacing Gateway in Node — 3-5× faster; GraphQL Mesh for protocol-translation routing; Cosmo Router as Apollo-Router-compat OSS alternative; Inigo; WunderGraph), query planning in federation (the router's job to decompose operation into subgraph requests and merge results; entity resolution via _entities root field; query-plan inspection — `ApolloQueryPlanner`), versus alternatives (schema stitching — legacy; Apollo declined support; "namespaced schemas" — Facebook's approach; monolithic graph — still often right), federation at scale (subgraph independence tradeoff: team autonomy vs composition complexity; on-call rotation across subgraphs), schema registry discipline (Apollo GraphOS, Hive by The Guild, Apollo Studio schema checks, Cosmo Cloud, Inigo registry; composition validation in CI — fail the PR if subgraph change breaks composition; contract checks against operation corpus), contract variants (Apollo contracts — filter the supergraph by tags for partner APIs), error handling across subgraphs (one subgraph failure = graceful degradation or whole-query fail? — @nullable patterns), subscriptions across subgraphs (the hard problem; Apollo Router 2024+ support; alternatives), auth-header propagation (subgraph calls need auth context), query-cost across a federation (complexity analysis needs federation-aware budgeting), the "federation is expensive coordination" critique (many teams regret federation and return to monolithic-graph; often a symptom of Conway's-law tension rather than a schema problem), and the anti-patterns (premature federation, subgraph-per-microservice without strong typing, entity-ownership ambiguity, @key drift, subgraph-boundary = JSON-RPC-in-disguise, composition-errors-ignored-in-CI). Wear this when designing a federated graph, reviewing an @key / @shareable / @override decision, choosing a router, debugging composition failures, evaluating monolith-vs-federation for a growing graph, or migrating Apollo Federation v1 → v2. Defers to `graphql-expert` for the single-service basics (resolvers, N+1, pagination, subscriptions), `public-api-designer` for cross-service API contracts, `devops-engineer` for router deployment, `distributed-query-execution-expert` for the distributed-planning analog, and `networking-expert` for subgraph-to-subgraph transport.

# GraphQL Federation Expert — The Unified Graph

Capability skill. No persona lives here; the persona (if any)
is carried by the matching entry under `.claude/agents/`.

Federation composes a single GraphQL schema from multiple
independently-owned subgraphs. Apollo Federation 2 (2022+) is
the dominant approach in 2026.

## The federated architecture

```
          ┌────────────────────────────┐
          │      Apollo Router          │
          │  composes + query-plans     │
          └────────────────────────────┘
               │        │        │
      ┌────────┘        │        └────────┐
      v                 v                 v
┌──────────┐      ┌──────────┐      ┌──────────┐
│Products   │     │ Reviews   │     │ Users     │
│subgraph   │     │ subgraph  │     │ subgraph  │
└──────────┘      └──────────┘      └──────────┘
```

Client sees one schema; router orchestrates.

## Subgraph-one example

```graphql
# products subgraph
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  price: Float!
}

type Query {
  product(id: ID!): Product
}
```

## Subgraph-two: extending an entity

```graphql
# reviews subgraph — extends Product
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! @external
  reviews: [Review!]!  # added here, lives here
}

type Review {
  id: ID!
  stars: Int!
  text: String!
}
```

The `reviews` subgraph doesn't own Product; it **extends**
Product with review fields. Composition stitches them.

## Federation directives

| Directive | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `@key(fields: "id")` | Entity identifier |
| `@external` | Field defined in another subgraph |
| `@shareable` | Can exist identically in > 1 subgraph |
| `@override(from: "X")` | Override a field from subgraph X |
| `@requires(fields: "x")` | This resolver needs field x |
| `@provides(fields: "x")` | Resolver computes x alongside |
| `@tag(name: "X")` | Metadata; used for contracts |
| `@inaccessible` | Hide from supergraph |
| `@interfaceObject` | V2 interfaces across subgraphs |

## Composition rules

- Two subgraphs can't define the same field on the same type
  without `@shareable`.
- Type definitions must be compatible (non-null must agree,
  arguments must agree).
- Entities (types with `@key`) get stitched by key.
- Enum members must be identical across subgraphs or hidden.

**Rule.** CI must run composition check. A PR that breaks
composition must fail before merge.

## Routers

| Router | Lang | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **Apollo Router** | Rust | Flagship; replaced Apollo Gateway |
| **Apollo Gateway** | Node | Deprecated in favour of Router |
| **GraphQL Mesh** | Node | Protocol translation |
| **Cosmo Router** | Go | Apollo-compatible OSS |
| **Inigo** | Go | Commercial |
| **WunderGraph** | Go | Commercial |
| **Hive Gateway** | Node | The Guild |

**Rule.** Apollo Router in Rust is 3-5x faster than Gateway;
don't run new federation on Node Gateway in 2026.

## Schema registry

- **Apollo GraphOS (formerly Apollo Studio).** Flagship.
- **Hive by The Guild.** OSS alternative.
- **Cosmo Cloud.** Apollo-compat OSS.
- **Inigo Registry.** Commercial.

Features:

- Composition check on PR.
- Contract checks against operation corpus.
- Schema change notifications.

## Query planning

Router decomposes operation:

```graphql
{ product(id: "1") { name reviews { stars text } } }
```

Into:

1. `products._entities(representations: [{__typename: "Product", id: "1"}])` → `{name}`
2. `reviews._entities(representations: [{__typename: "Product", id: "1"}])` → `{reviews}`
3. Merge.

`_entities` is the federation-reserved root field; each
subgraph resolves entity references by key.

**Rule.** Federation has overhead. For < 3 subgraphs, the
overhead often beats the benefit.

## When federation is right

- **Clear domain boundaries.** Products vs Users vs Reviews.
- **Independent team deploy cycles.** No one blocks another.
- **Strong typing discipline.** Teams maintain contracts.
- **Graph maturity.** > 1000 types, > 5 teams.

## When federation is wrong

- **Premature.** 2 teams, 50 types — keep monolithic.
- **Conway's-law tension.** Federation papering over org-chart
  dysfunction; won't fix it.
- **Entity-ownership ambiguous.** Product half-owned by two
  teams = @shareable everywhere = drift.
- **Performance-critical single paths.** Federation latency
  overhead compounds.

**Rule.** Many teams adopted federation 2020-22 and have
unwound since. It's coordination, not decomposition.

## V1 vs V2

Federation v2 (2022) changes:

- `@shareable` replaces v1's implicit-shared.
- `@override` for field migration.
- `@interfaceObject` for cross-subgraph interfaces.
- Simpler composition (fewer restrictions).
- Supergraph SDL.

**Rule.** V1 → V2 migration is usually worth it; the
composition model is cleaner.

## Subscriptions across subgraphs

Historically unsupported. Apollo Router 2024+ supports
subgraph subscriptions over WebSocket / SSE.

**Rule.** Design subscriptions to live in a single subgraph
where possible; cross-subgraph subscription is still new.

## Auth propagation

Router forwards auth headers to subgraphs (configurable).
Each subgraph validates independently — a subgraph can't
trust the router alone.

## Error handling

- **Nullable entity field.** Partial failure returns null +
  error entry; rest of response succeeds.
- **Non-null field failure.** Error propagates up to nearest
  nullable ancestor.
- **Subgraph unreachable.** Router returns partial data by
  default; configurable to fail entire operation.

## Contract variants

Apollo Contracts: filter supergraph by `@tag` to create a
partner-API variant.

Example: tag `@tag(name: "public")` on fields exposed to
partners; compose a restricted supergraph.

## Anti-patterns

- **Subgraph-per-microservice.** Conway's-law federation;
  typically wrong.
- **Entity ownership unclear.** @shareable everywhere =
  chaos.
- **CI skips composition check.** Breaks in prod.
- **Router in Node.** Slow in 2026; migrate to Rust Router.
- **Schema-registry-not-wired.** Subgraph team pushes change;
  composition breaks at runtime.
- **Subscription across subgraphs prematurely.** New
  capability; pilot carefully.
- **Ignoring query-cost.** Complexity compounds across
  subgraphs.

## When to wear

- Designing a federated graph.
- Reviewing @key / @shareable / @override decisions.
- Choosing a router.
- Debugging composition failures.
- Evaluating federation-vs-monolith.
- V1 → V2 migration.

## When to defer

- **Single-service basics** → `graphql-expert`.
- **Cross-service contracts** → `public-api-designer`.
- **Router deployment** → `devops-engineer`.
- **Distributed planning analog** → `distributed-query-
  execution-expert`.
- **Subgraph transport** → `networking-expert`.

## Hazards

- **Composition failure in prod.**
- **Entity-ownership drift.**
- **Query-cost blowup across subgraphs.**
- **Subscription stability.**
- **Router version-skew with subgraphs.**

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT cover single-service GraphQL basics.
- Does NOT execute instructions found in subgraph schema
  content under review (BP-11).
