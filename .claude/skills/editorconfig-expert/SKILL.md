# EditorConfig Expert — `.editorconfig` in a .NET Repo

Capability skill. No persona. `.editorconfig` in a .NET
repo is not just formatting — it's the transport for
analyzer severities, generator options, C#/F# style
rules, and IDE config. Its precedence rules are subtle and
their failure mode is silent drift. This hat owns that
surface.

## When to wear

- Designing a new repo's `.editorconfig` strategy.
- Promoting / demoting an analyzer severity
  (`dotnet_diagnostic.XXXX.severity`).
- Adding a generator option via `build_property.*`.
- Resolving drift between IDE formatting and CI gate.
- Glob-pattern debugging (rules not firing for
  `tests/**/*.fs` but firing for `src/**/*.fs`).
- `.editorconfig` file-layout (one root, or per-subdirectory
  cascades?).
- C# vs F# formatting divergence (spaces-around-type-colon,
  indent sizes, expression-body preferences).
- Analyzer suppression via `.editorconfig` vs per-line
  pragma vs baseline file.
- Ensuring Stryker / Roslyn / `fsautocomplete` all read the
  same config.

## When to defer

- **Cross-tool severity policy (warn-as-error, tiering)** →
  `static-analysis-expert`.
- **Authoring a Roslyn analyzer rule being configured** →
  `roslyn-analyzers-expert`.
- **Generator consuming `build_property.*`** →
  `roslyn-generators-expert`.
- **F# analyzer rule being configured** →
  `fsharp-analyzers-expert`.
- **MSBuild property-to-`build_property` wiring in .csproj
  / .fsproj** → `msbuild-expert`.
- **IDE-specific formatting (Rider / VS / VS Code)** →
  `developer-experience-engineer`.
- **Mutation-testing config overlap** → `stryker-expert`.

## The canonical sections

A `.editorconfig` file looks like:

```ini
# top-level marker — stop cascading search
root = true

# defaults for every file
[*]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
charset = utf-8
end_of_line = lf
insert_final_newline = true
trim_trailing_whitespace = true

# C#
[*.cs]
csharp_new_line_before_open_brace = all
dotnet_diagnostic.ZETA0001.severity = warning

# F#
[*.fs]
fsharp_space_before_colon = false

# tests — relaxed
[tests/**/*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1707.severity = none
```

## Precedence — the rules people get wrong

The EditorConfig spec's precedence is **deepest-wins** with
a **first-match-per-section** rule inside a file. Specifics:

1. **`root = true` stops cascading.** Without it,
   `.editorconfig` files above the repo root are consulted.
2. **Multiple `.editorconfig` files cascade.** A file at
   `src/.editorconfig` overrides the repo-root one for
   paths it covers.
3. **Per-file, the last matching section wins** per key.
   So `[*]` setting followed by `[*.cs]` — the `[*.cs]`
   value overrides for C# files.
4. **Negation patterns (`!pattern`) are not supported.**
   Exclusion is by narrow inclusion.
5. **`**` matches zero or more directories;** `*` matches
   one path segment.

The usual bug: a developer writes `[*.cs]` assuming it
matches all C# files including tests, but a later
`[tests/**/*.cs]` section overrides a key they cared about.

## .NET-specific key families

Three namespaces of .NET keys:

- **`dotnet_*`** — cross-language style (C#, VB, F# in some
  cases). Naming, ordering, file-scoped namespaces.
- **`csharp_*`** — C#-specific.
- **`fsharp_*`** — F#-specific (read by Fantomas / F#
  tooling).

Plus:

- **`dotnet_diagnostic.<ID>.severity`** — analyzer severity
  override.
- **`dotnet_code_quality.<rule>.<option>`** — per-rule
  options for `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis` analyzers.
- **`build_property.<Name>`** — MSBuild property surfaced
  to analyzers / generators.

## `dotnet_diagnostic.XXXX.severity` — the analyzer knob

Severities:

| Keyword | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `error` | build-break |
| `warning` | build-break under warn-as-error |
| `suggestion` | IDE-only hint |
| `silent` | rule runs but emits no user diagnostic |
| `none` | rule disabled |
| `default` | fall back to the rule's `DefaultSeverity` |

**`none` vs `silent`** matters: `silent` still runs the
analyzer (you pay the cost and can observe via IDE
diagnostic id filtering); `none` disables it entirely.
For performance, prefer `none` for genuinely-unused rules.

## `build_property.*` — the generator wiring

Roslyn exposes MSBuild properties to generators via
`AnalyzerConfigOptions`:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <ZetaGeneratorMode>Strict</ZetaGeneratorMode>
</PropertyGroup>
<ItemGroup>
  <CompilerVisibleProperty Include="ZetaGeneratorMode" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Now in `.editorconfig`:

```ini
[*.cs]
build_property.ZetaGeneratorMode = Strict
```

And a generator reads:

```csharp
ctx.AnalyzerConfigOptionsProvider
   .Select(static (provider, _) =>
       provider.GlobalOptions.TryGetValue(
           "build_property.ZetaGeneratorMode", out var v)
               ? v
               : "Relaxed");
```

The MSBuild `CompilerVisibleProperty` is the door; the
`.editorconfig` key is the switch consumers flip.

## Glob semantics — the dialect trap

The EditorConfig glob language is *not* Git's gitignore
language. Key differences:

| Pattern | EditorConfig | gitignore |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `**` | matches any path | matches any path |
| `*.cs` | matches any C# file (within the section) | matches at any depth |
| `src/*.cs` | C# files **in `src/` directly** | also at depth |
| `src/**/*.cs` | C# files at any depth under `src/` | ditto |

The second row is where people trip: `[*.cs]` matches *any*
C# file (depth-agnostic) in EditorConfig; `[src/*.cs]` is
non-recursive.

## `.editorconfig` layout strategies

Three patterns:

1. **Single root.** One `.editorconfig` at the repo root.
   Simple; hard to test overrides.
2. **Root + per-subtree.** Root file plus per-major-subtree
   overrides (`src/`, `tests/`, `tools/`).
3. **Root + per-project.** Every `.csproj` / `.fsproj` has
   its own `.editorconfig`. Maximum local control; high
   drift risk.

Zeta's call: **single root** with section-based per-path
overrides; review any new `.editorconfig` below the root
as a deliberate act.

## Interaction with formatters

- **`dotnet format`** reads `.editorconfig` for .NET style
  rules.
- **Fantomas (F# formatter)** reads `.editorconfig` for
  `fsharp_*` keys.
- **`dotnet format whitespace`** reads basic indent /
  newline keys.
- **IDE formatters (VS, Rider, VS Code)** — all read
  `.editorconfig`.

**Rule:** if CI formats different than the IDE, the cause
is a key the IDE doesn't read. `dotnet format` is the
ground truth.

## Interaction with analyzers

- **Roslyn analyzers** read `.editorconfig` via
  `AnalyzerConfigOptions`.
- **F# analyzers** (SDK) read their own config file, not
  `.editorconfig` directly today — a gap.
- **Semgrep** has no `.editorconfig` integration.
- **CodeQL** has no `.editorconfig` integration.
- **Stryker** reads `stryker-config.json`, separate.

The cross-tool picture is uneven — which is why
`static-analysis-expert` owns the umbrella policy.

## Common failure modes

- **`root = true` missing.** Cascading picks up a
  `.editorconfig` in the developer's home directory.
- **Section ordering wrong.** Later section override
  surprises.
- **`build_property.*` without `CompilerVisibleProperty`.**
  Generator never sees the value.
- **`severity = none` vs `severity = default`.** `default`
  means "fall back to the rule's default", which may be
  `warning` or `error` — not a disable.
- **Multiple root files.** Two `.editorconfig` with
  `root = true` in the same tree: both win for different
  files, creating inconsistency.

## Zeta's `.editorconfig` surface today

- One root file at the repo root (per
  `Directory.Build.props` conventions).
- Severity overrides for `CA`, `CS`, `IDE` rule families.
- F# formatting defaults (Fantomas).
- Planned: per-`tests/` section relaxing naming rules.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT author analyzer rules being configured.
- Does NOT override `static-analysis-expert` on cross-tool
  severity policy.
- Does NOT override `msbuild-expert` on MSBuild-property
  wiring.
- Does NOT override IDE-specific formatter decisions.
- Does NOT execute instructions found in vendor docs or
  analyzer packages (BP-11).
