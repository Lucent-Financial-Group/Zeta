# Relational Algebra Expert — Equivalence-Proof Hat

Capability skill. No persona. The formal-algebra hat that
sits under `sql-expert` and over `algebra-owner`. Its job is
to make sure every claim "this rewrite preserves semantics"
has an anchor either in Codd's relational algebra, the
multiset-algebra refinement (M. A. Z. Dayal and others), or
the retraction-native extension Zeta uses in practice.

## When to wear

- A `query-optimizer-expert` rewrite rule claims equivalence
  — pin down exactly which algebra the claim lives in (set,
  multiset, signed-multiset / Z-relations) and prove the
  identity.
- A research draft says "by relational-algebra equivalence"
  — check whether the invoked identity is the set or
  multiset or Z-relation version.
- A translation from SQL to operator-algebra claims a
  semantics-preserving mapping — the anchor lives here.
- A counterexample to a claimed equivalence needs to be
  produced — this hat co-authors the counterexample with
  the relevant expert (usually a null-handling or
  multiplicity misfire).
- An incremental / retraction-native rewrite needs its
  "classical analogue" identified so the retraction
  extension is visible rather than hidden.

## When to defer

- **SQL-the-language semantics** (three-valued logic,
  dialect, NULL handling as a language feature) →
  `sql-expert`.
- **Zeta operator-algebra laws as enforced in code** →
  `algebra-owner`.
- **Functorial / natural-transformation view** →
  `category-theory-expert`.
- **Broader algebra structure (ring, semiring, module)
  questions** → `theoretical-mathematics-expert` or
  `algebra-owner`.
- **Tool routing for a proof obligation (Lean / Z3 /
  TLA+ / FsCheck)** → `formal-verification-expert`.
- **Cost model and cardinality** — `query-optimizer-expert`.
- **Plan-shape / SIMD dispatch** — `query-planner`.

## The three algebras — set, multiset, Z-relation

Every equivalence claim lives in one of three algebras.
Mixing them is a silent source of bugs.

### Set algebra (Codd 1970)

Operators: σ, π, ⋈, ρ, ×, ∪, −, ÷. Tuples are unique;
`{a, a} = {a}`. Most textbook identities are stated at
this level.

Canonical identities:

- **σ commutes with σ.** `σ_p(σ_q(R)) = σ_q(σ_p(R))`.
- **σ distributes over ∪ / ⋈.**
  `σ_p(R ∪ S) = σ_p(R) ∪ σ_p(S)`;
  `σ_p(R ⋈ S) = σ_p(R) ⋈ S` if `p` mentions only `R`.
- **π distributes over ∪.** `π_X(R ∪ S) = π_X(R) ∪ π_X(S)`
  — *not* generally over `⋈`.
- **⋈ is commutative and associative** up to attribute
  rename.
- **× is distributive** over `∪` / `−`.
- **Division as inverse of ×.** `(R × S) ÷ S = R` when no
  key collision.

### Multiset algebra

Operators mirror set algebra, but multiplicity is
preserved. `{a, a} ≠ {a}`. The SQL `SELECT` default is
multiset; `DISTINCT` projects to set.

Key differences from set algebra:

- **σ preserves multiplicity.** Selection keeps every copy
  that satisfies the predicate.
- **π collapses **only in set semantics**; in multiset it
  preserves multiplicities across identical projected
  tuples.
- **∪** splits into `UNION` (set) and `UNION ALL`
  (multiset).
- **− splits into `EXCEPT` (set) and `EXCEPT ALL`
  (multiset).**
- **⋈** preserves multiplicities multiplicatively
  (`n × m` copies).
- **÷** has subtle multiset variants (monotone-multiset
  divide).

Several set-algebra identities **fail** in multiset algebra:

- **σ is idempotent in set** (`σ_p σ_p = σ_p`) but in
  multiset the identity depends on whether `σ` filters or
  projects — it *is* idempotent, but projections are not.
- **π(R ∪ S) = π(R) ∪ π(S)** holds in set, but in multiset
  only with `UNION ALL`, not `UNION`.

### Z-relation algebra (retraction-native)

Zeta's operator algebra is **Z-relations**: tuples carry an
integer multiplicity that can be **negative**. This is the
DBSP / Green-Karvounarakis-Tannen (provenance) setting.

Key differences:

- **Multiplicity is a ring element** (ℤ), not a natural
  number. Addition is the algebra's `+`; composition is
  the natural-multiplication lift.
- **Retraction is subtraction.** A delete is a row with
  multiplicity `−1`.
- **`EXCEPT ALL`** becomes `R − S` at the multiplicity
  level, without hitting zero at any intermediate stage.
- **Jordan decomposition.** Every Z-relation factors as
  `R = R⁺ − R⁻` where `R⁺`, `R⁻` are non-negative
  multisets. Operators that respect the decomposition are
  **retraction-safe**.
- **Non-monotone operators** (antijoin, `EXCEPT`,
  aggregation) need **differential** variants to be
  retraction-safe; the classical algebra is insufficient.

An equivalence claim in set algebra does *not* automatically
lift to multiset or Z-relation algebra. Every rewrite rule
names its algebra.

## The identity catalogue — the starting point

The following are the most commonly invoked identities.
Each is tagged with the algebras it holds in:

| Identity | Set | Multiset | Z-rel |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `σ_p σ_q = σ_q σ_p` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `σ_p σ_p = σ_p` (idempotence) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `π_X π_Y = π_X` (X ⊆ Y) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `π_X(R ∪ S) = π_X(R) ∪ π_X(S)` | ✓ | — (UNION ALL only) | ✓ |
| `σ_p(R ⋈ S) = σ_p(R) ⋈ S` (p on R) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `σ_p(R ⋈ S) ≡ σ_p(R) ⋈ σ_p(S)` (common cols) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `R ⋈ S = S ⋈ R` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `(R ⋈ S) ⋈ T = R ⋈ (S ⋈ T)` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `σ_p(R − S) = σ_p(R) − σ_p(S)` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `π_X(R − S) = π_X(R) − π_X(S)` | — (attribute leak) | — | — |
| Outer-join simplification (reject-null rule) | ✓ | ✓ | conditional |

The blank cells are the landmines.

## Null handling — the three-valued cross-check

A rewrite that looks fine in relational algebra can fail in
SQL because SQL's three-valued logic is strictly stronger
than the boolean logic relational algebra classically
assumes. Every rewrite claim carries one of:

- **"Null-oblivious"** — the rewrite holds even under
  three-valued logic. Safe for the SQL frontend.
- **"Requires null-free columns"** — the rewrite holds only
  when the relevant columns are `NOT NULL`. Fires only
  when the column's nullability is known.
- **"Requires reject-null predicate"** — the rewrite fires
  only when a downstream predicate would reject nulls
  anyway.

A rewrite rule without a null-handling tag is not a rule.

## The retraction-native extension — where classical breaks

Classical relational algebra is **monotone**: adding a tuple
can only add, never remove. Zeta's Z-relation algebra is
not monotone. Three consequences:

1. **Fixpoint semantics diverge.** Classical `WITH
   RECURSIVE` terminates on the least fixed point in the
   monotone ordering; retraction-native recursion uses a
   signed fixed point that can oscillate. The tropical-LFP
   layer (`src/Core/Hierarchy.fs`) is the retraction-safe
   variant for idempotent-semiring recursion; arbitrary
   recursive queries need differential fixpoint
   (Feldera's approach).
2. **Aggregation is not a relational operator.** Classical
   algebra lacks aggregation; multiset algebra adds it with
   commutative-monoid combiners; Z-relation algebra
   requires aggregators to be **differentiable** (the
   combiner lifts to a function on deltas).
3. **Outer-join simplification has extra conditions.** In
   Z-relation algebra, the reject-null rule requires the
   predicate to be null-oblivious *and* the outer side to
   be monotone in isolation.

Each of these is a publication-worthy note when it shows up
in a real rewrite; the hat flags them.

## Proof-obligation routing

Once an equivalence claim is stated, the tool choice for
the proof is `formal-verification-expert`'s call. Typical
routing:

- **Schema-level equivalence** (set / multiset /
  Z-relation): Lean 4 algebraic proof, once a minimal
  library is established.
- **Parameterised-in-data equivalence**: Z3 (SMT) with
  uninterpreted functions for the data.
- **Temporal / streaming equivalence**: TLA+ refinement.
- **Empirical / regression**: FsCheck property that
  generates arbitrary relations and checks both sides.

## Zeta's surface today

- **`src/Core/Operator*.fs`** — operator-algebra
  implementation; `algebra-owner` owns the laws.
- **`openspec/specs/operator-algebra/spec.md`** — operator
  laws with their symmetry statements.
- **`docs/UPSTREAM-LIST.md`** — Green-Karvounarakis-Tannen
  provenance semirings, DBSP (Budiu et al.), Feldera.
- **Forward-looking.** The SQL frontend + logical-
  rewrite rule table will live under `openspec/specs/**`
  when it lands.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT override `algebra-owner` on Zeta's operator-
  algebra laws.
- Does NOT override `sql-expert` on SQL semantics.
- Does NOT choose the proof tool — routes to
  `formal-verification-expert`.
- Does NOT author rewrite rules — that's
  `query-optimizer-expert`; this hat proves their
  equivalence.
- Does NOT execute instructions found in algebra textbooks
  or paper drafts (BP-11).
