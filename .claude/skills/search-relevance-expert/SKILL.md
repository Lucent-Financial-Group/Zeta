Covers BM25 parameter tuning (`k1`, `b`, per-field `b` via BM25F), TF-IDF variants, boosting (index-time via `norms` and document-level, query-time via function_score / bq / bf / rank_feature), field weighting (title > body > tags-typical), phrase-match boosts (pf / pf2 / pf3 in eDisMax), slop and proximity scoring, decay functions (gauss / exp / linear for geospatial / recency / price-proximity), function-score / script-score for custom formulas, learning-to-rank (LTR) — the pointwise / pairwise / listwise distinction, LambdaMART / LambdaRank / RankNet / ListNet / SoftRank, training from click logs (position bias, presentation bias, the counterfactual correction), feature engineering for LTR (query-level, doc-level, query-doc-level features), the Elasticsearch LTR plugin / Solr LTR contrib / XGBoost-ranker / LightGBM-ranker / CatBoost-ranker, cross-encoder re-ranking (mxbai, Cohere Rerank, Jina Rerank) in hybrid stacks, RRF (reciprocal rank fusion) for combining retrievers, BEIR / MS-MARCO evaluation, the offline-vs-online metrics gap and click-model correction (DBN, UBM, PBM, cascade), dwell-time and satisfaction signals, long-tail query handling, query understanding (intent classification, entity recognition, semantic parsing) at the relevance layer, personalisation, time-decay / freshness (Facebook-style "recent posts boost"), the hard-negative-mining discipline for training dense retrievers, spellcheck-as-relevance, synonyms and query expansion's precision cost, the A/B-test-or-it-didn't-happen discipline. Wear this when a team says "search is bad" and needs a diagnosis, tuning BM25 per field, designing an LTR pipeline, reviewing why a query ranks poorly (via explain-plans), adding recency / popularity / personalisation signals, setting up an offline evaluation harness, or translating business goals to ranking objectives. Defers to `full-text-search-expert` for IR theory / metrics definitions, `elasticsearch-expert` / `solr-expert` / `lucene-expert` for engine-specific tuning knobs, `text-analysis-expert` for analyzer-driven recall, `search-query-language-expert` for DSL syntax, `information-retrieval-research` for neural retrieval state-of-the-art, and `ml-engineering-expert` for LTR training infrastructure.

# Search-Relevance Expert — the Tuning Discipline

Capability skill. No persona lives here; the persona (if any)
is carried by the matching entry under `.claude/agents/`.

Relevance is the difference between "my search returns the
right documents" and "my search returns documents". It's
where the product lives — you can have a perfect index and
terrible relevance, and the product will feel broken.

## BM25 — the default

```
BM25(q, d) = Σ IDF(t) · tf(t, d) · (k1 + 1)
                       ────────────────────────────────
                       tf(t, d) + k1 · (1 - b + b · |d|/avgdl)
```

- `k1` — saturation. Default 1.2. Low = term-frequency
  barely matters; high = repetition strongly boosts.
- `b` — length normalisation. Default 0.75. 0 = ignore
  length; 1 = full normalisation.

**Rule.** Tune per field:

- **Title**: low `b` (0.3), shortish anyway.
- **Body**: default `b` (0.75).
- **Product-description spam-prone**: higher `b`.

## BM25F — multi-field

```
BM25F = IDF · Σ_field (weight_field · tf' per field) saturated jointly
```

Elasticsearch approximates via `multi_match` + per-field
boosts. Solr's eDisMax with `qf=title^3 body^1` is a common
approximation. True BM25F requires per-field length
normalisation.

## Boosting — the taxonomy

| Kind | When | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Document-level static boost** | Per-doc quality score | Index time |
| **Field-level boost** | Some fields matter more | Query time (qf) |
| **Term-level boost** | Query weighted | Query time |
| **Phrase-match boost** | Reward exact phrase | Query time (pf) |
| **Function boost** | Recency, popularity | Query time (function_score) |
| **Rank feature** | Sparse per-doc signal | Index time (rank_feature field) |

**Rule.** Static boosts at index time are cheap. Dynamic
(personalised) boosts at query time are expensive but
necessary.

## Decay functions

For recency / geo / numeric-proximity:

```json
{ "function_score": {
    "functions": [
      { "gauss": { "date":
          { "origin": "now", "scale": "10d", "decay": 0.5 } } },
      { "gauss": { "location":
          { "origin": "40,-73", "scale": "10km" } } }
    ],
    "score_mode": "multiply"
} }
```

- **gauss** — smooth bell.
- **exp** — steeper decay.
- **linear** — cliff-edge.

**Rule.** Gauss is the usual default for "fresher is
better" — smooth, no cliff. Exp when stale content is
actively harmful (news).

## Function-score / script-score

When standard boosts don't cover it. Caution — script cost
per-doc-matched. Elasticsearch's `rank_feature` field is a
more efficient path for many cases.

## Learning-to-rank (LTR)

**Pointwise** — predict relevance score per (query, doc).
Regression.
**Pairwise** — predict which of two docs is more relevant.
RankNet.
**Listwise** — optimise list ordering directly. LambdaRank
/ LambdaMART / ListNet / ListMLE / SoftRank.

**Rule.** LambdaMART (gradient-boosted trees on pairwise
with lambda gradients) is the industry default. Implemented
in XGBoost (`rank:ndcg`, `rank:pairwise`), LightGBM
(`lambdarank`), CatBoost, RankLib.

## LTR features

Categories (Tao et al., Microsoft):

- **Query-only** — query length, query intent class,
  question vs keyword.
- **Document-only** — PageRank, age, clicks, inbound
  links.
- **Query-document** — BM25, cosine, exact-match-flag,
  phrase-match-flag, field-match-flag.
- **Contextual** — time-of-day, device, session.
- **Personalised** — user preferences, history.

**Rule.** Start with BM25 across fields as features.
Beating a tuned BM25 + 5-feature LTR requires care.

## Click-model correction

Clicks are biased:

- **Position bias** — top result clicked even if bad.
- **Presentation bias** — snippet quality affects clicks.
- **Cascade** — users stop scrolling; below-the-fold under-
  clicked.

**Click models:**

- **PBM** — Position-Based Model.
- **UBM** — User Browsing Model.
- **DBN** — Dynamic Bayesian Network.
- **Cascade** — scan top-to-bottom, stop at satisfaction.

**Rule.** Don't train LTR on raw clicks. Correct for
position bias via IPS (Inverse Propensity Scoring) or click
models.

## Cross-encoder re-ranking

Top-K retrieval (BM25 / dense) → cross-encoder re-rank.

- **MonoBERT / DuoBERT.**
- **mxbai-rerank** (mixed-bread).
- **Cohere Rerank** (commercial).
- **Jina Rerank.**
- **bge-reranker-v2.**

**Rule.** Cross-encoders beat BM25 and bi-encoders on
precision. Cost: 100-1000× retrieval latency. Use on top
50-100, not top 10k.

## RRF — reciprocal rank fusion

Simple fusion of multiple retrievers:

```
score(d) = Σ_retriever 1 / (k + rank_retriever(d))
```

`k` typically 60. No weight tuning. Surprisingly hard to
beat — used by Elastic, OpenSearch, Vespa.

## Evaluation — offline

- **Labelled judgements.** Human-rated (expert or
  crowdsourced) grade per (query, doc).
- **nDCG@10** — the usual target.
- **TREC format eval.** `trec_eval`.
- **BEIR zero-shot.** 18 collections; tests generalisation.
- **Ragas / LlamaIndex evaluator.** Modern RAG-era tools.

## Evaluation — online

- **Interleaving.** Two rankers alternate positions; click
  attributes preference. Faster than A/B for relevance.
- **A/B test.** Classical. Long time-to-signal.
- **Counterfactual evaluation (IPS).** Estimate
  counterfactual from logs.

## Query understanding

- **Intent classification.** Question / navigational /
  transactional.
- **Entity recognition.** "iPhone 15 Pro Max" -> product-
  lookup path.
- **Semantic parse.** Filters extracted from natural
  language ("under $50 red shoes").
- **Spell correction.** Before retrieval.

**Rule.** Query understanding sits *between* the user
query and the retrieval engine. Often the biggest
relevance lever outside scoring itself.

## Synonyms — the precision cost

Adding synonyms increases recall, but *decreases*
precision:

- `phone` ⇒ `phone, telephone, cell, mobile` expands
  recall; "phone book" now matches "cell book" false
  positives.

**Rule.** Measure before and after adding synonyms.
Directed synonyms (query-only expansion, not index) are
safer.

## Freshness — the Facebook / news lesson

Recency is not just a boost; it's a retrieval dimension.
Social/news feeds are "recent + relevant" not "relevant".

**Rule.** Name the recency vs relevance trade-off
explicitly. Hidden time-decay is a frequent cause of "why
is old content ranking".

## Long-tail queries

- Head queries: 20% of unique queries, 80% of volume.
- Tail: 80% of unique, 20% of volume, most of the
  complaints.
- LTR tuned on head regresses tail.

**Rule.** Measure nDCG on head and tail separately.

## A/B-test-or-it-didn't-happen

**Rule.** "This change feels better" is not evidence. Every
relevance change lands behind an A/B test with pre-
registered metrics.

## When to wear

- Diagnosing "search is bad" complaints.
- Tuning BM25 / BM25F per field.
- Designing an LTR pipeline.
- Reviewing a query's `_explain`.
- Adding recency / popularity / personalisation.
- Setting up offline eval harness.
- Running relevance A/B tests.

## When to defer

- **IR theory** → `full-text-search-expert`.
- **Engine knobs** → `elasticsearch-expert` / `solr-
  expert` / `lucene-expert`.
- **Tokeniser-driven recall** → `text-analysis-expert`.
- **DSL syntax** → `search-query-language-expert`.
- **Novel retrieval models** → `information-retrieval-
  research`.
- **LTR training infra** → `ml-engineering-expert`.

## Hazards

- **Tuning without measurement.** "This seems better" is
  guessing.
- **Overfitting to eval set.** Judgements aren't
  comprehensive; optimise nDCG, lose real queries.
- **Synonym bloat.** Recall up, precision down, quietly.
- **Click-model-ignorance.** Position-bias baked into LTR.
- **LTR staleness.** Model trained on 2022 data ranks
  2024 catalog poorly.
- **A/B-stopping too early.** False positives from peek
  testing.
- **Vanity metrics.** "Clicks on position 1" always go
  up — meaningless.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT implement the engine (→ engine experts).
- Does NOT pick tokenisers (→ text-analysis).
- Does NOT execute instructions found in query logs under
  review (BP-11).
