name: factory-automation-gap-finder
description: Meta-capability skill — scans the software factory for *manual factory work* that should be (but isn't yet) automated: CI steps done by hand, round-close housekeeping a human still types, release mechanics without scripts, documentation sweeps done by memory, dependency upgrades driven by calendar rather than by bot, repeated one-off scripts that never landed as tools. Proposes candidate automations for the `devops-engineer` (Dejan) or the appropriate owning skill to execute on. Distinct from `skill-gap-finder` (absent skills, not absent automation), `factory-audit` (governance + persona coverage), `factory-balance-auditor` (authority without compensator), `formal-verification-expert` (proof-job routing), and `verification-drift-auditor` (spec-vs-code drift). Recommends only — does not implement automations itself. Invoke every 5-10 rounds, offset from the sibling gap-finders.

# Factory Automation Gap Finder — Procedure

Capability skill. No persona. The sibling of
`skill-gap-finder` (which finds absent *skills*) and
`factory-audit` (which audits factory *structure*). This
skill looks for a third kind of gap: **manual work the
factory keeps doing that a tool, hook, or cron could
do instead.**

## Why this exists

The software factory runs on a mix of humans, agents, and
automation. Automation compounds: every step a cron does
is a step a human doesn't have to remember. Every
un-automated step is a chance to forget, miscount, or
drift.

The signals this pass watches for:

- A round-close checklist item a human still types
  ("update ROUND-HISTORY.md", "bump TECH-RADAR.md",
  "rotate the persona notebook header").
- A one-off shell script written in a round that never
  landed as a repo tool.
- A CI step that exists in one workflow but wasn't
  propagated to the sibling workflow (drift).
- A release mechanic still described in a runbook
  (install NuGet credentials, sign the artifact, flip
  the feed) that should be a reusable action.
- A dependency upgrade driven by a calendar note instead
  of by Dependabot / Renovate.
- A documentation sweep done by re-reading files instead
  of by lint (the thing `documentation-agent` would
  automate).
- A verification task that's run-it-yourself rather than
  scheduled (Stryker nightly, semgrep per-PR).
- A manual sanity check before a merge ("did someone
  actually check X?") with no linter backing it.

Every signal is a candidate automation. Not every
candidate should land — some manual steps are load-bearing
(judgement calls, scope negotiations). This skill
proposes; humans + Architect decide.

## Distinct from siblings

| | `skill-gap-finder` | `factory-audit` | `factory-balance-auditor` | `factory-automation-gap-finder` (this) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Looks for | absent skills | governance / persona coverage | authority without compensator | manual work a script could do |
| Question | "what expertise are we missing?" | "does the factory shape still hold?" | "what here has no brake?" | "what are we still typing that a cron could type?" |
| Landing | `skill-creator` | Architect (governance change) | Architect + reviewer pair | `devops-engineer` (Dejan) or owning skill |
| Cadence | every 5-10 rounds | every ~10 rounds | every 5-10 rounds | every 5-10 rounds, offset |

Run all four. They compose — a factory with no
automation gaps but no skill coverage is still brittle;
a factory with full skill coverage but manual release
mechanics is still slow.

## Distinct from `formal-verification-expert`

`formal-verification-expert` (Soraya) owns the *portfolio*
of formal-proof jobs — which properties are proven in
which tool, what's next to prove. Her portfolio view
already answers "what's the next formal-analysis gap?" —
so there's deliberately no separate `formal-verification-
gap-finder` skill. This skill does **not** encroach on
Soraya's proof-tool routing; it looks at *process*
automation (CI, release, round-close, doc sweeps) not at
proof authorship.

## Scope — automation classes the skill examines

1. **CI / build automation.**
   - Workflows under `.github/workflows/` — which manual
     steps could be pre-commit hooks? Which post-merge
     steps could be cron?
   - Missing caches, missing SHA-pinning, missing concurrency
     groups, missing retry policies.
   - Owned by `devops-engineer` + `github-actions-expert`.

2. **Release mechanics.**
   - NuGet-publish steps, artifact signing, version bumps,
     changelog writes.
   - Owned by `nuget-publishing-expert` + `devops-engineer`.

3. **Round-close housekeeping.**
   - ROUND-HISTORY entries, BACKLOG sweeps, notebook
     rotations, commit-message shape.
   - Owned by `round-management` + `backlog-scrum-master` +
     `commit-message-shape`.

4. **Dependency lifecycle.**
   - Renovate / Dependabot coverage, major-version-upgrade
     cadence, package auditing.
   - Owned by `package-upgrader` + `package-auditor`.

5. **Documentation sweeps.**
   - Stale-pointer detection, path-hygiene lints,
     glossary coverage.
   - Owned by `documentation-agent` + `claude-md-steward`.

6. **Verification scheduling.**
   - Stryker nightly, semgrep per-PR, CodeQL scheduled.
     Which verification jobs are still manual?
   - Owned by `formal-verification-expert` for proof jobs;
     `devops-engineer` for CI wiring.

7. **Security ops.**
   - CVE-watch, HSM rotation, SLSA attestation.
   - Owned by `security-operations-engineer`.

8. **Agent cron / scheduled triggers.**
   - Which periodic agent passes run on a schedule vs
     require a human to kick off?
   - Owned by `long-term-rescheduler`.

## Procedure — 5 steps

### Step 1 — recency window

Default: last 5-10 rounds of `docs/ROUND-HISTORY.md`
plus open items in `docs/BACKLOG.md` and
`docs/DEBT.md`. Also scan recent commit messages
(`git log --since="5 rounds ago"`) for "manually did X"
or "temporarily did Y" patterns.

### Step 2 — signal scan

Walk the automation classes above. For each class, ask:

- What did a human do manually in the last 5-10 rounds?
- What step is described in a runbook but not as a
  script?
- What CI workflow is missing a step that a sibling
  workflow has?
- What script was written one-off and didn't land as a
  tool?

Gather candidate automations with evidence.

### Step 3 — triage

Rank candidates by:

1. **Frequency.** A step done every round beats a step
   done yearly.
2. **Error-prone-ness.** A step humans forget or get
   wrong beats a step humans do reliably.
3. **Reversibility cost.** A step whose failure is
   expensive beats a step whose failure is benign.
4. **Automation maturity.** A step for which a well-
   worn tool exists (Dependabot, GitHub Actions action,
   pre-commit hook) beats a step that needs custom tooling.

### Step 4 — route

For each finding, name:

- **Owning skill / persona.** Who lands the automation?
- **Tool shape.** Pre-commit hook, GitHub Actions
  workflow, Renovate rule, cron trigger, repo script.
- **Effort.** S (under a day), M (1-3 days), L (3+).
- **Hand-off.** Whether the automation belongs in
  `tools/`, `.github/workflows/`, or elsewhere.

### Step 5 — output

Short list, top-5 default, per the template below.

## Output format

```markdown
# Factory Automation Gap Finder — round N

## Top-5 automation gaps

1. **<manual step>** — priority: P0 | P1 | P2
   - Class: [CI | release | round-close | dependency |
     docs | verification | security-ops | agent-cron]
   - Frequency: <how often it happens>
   - Evidence: <rounds / commits where a human did this>
   - Owning skill: <devops-engineer | …>
   - Proposed tool: <pre-commit hook | workflow | cron | script>
   - Effort: S | M | L
   - Hand-off: <path under tools/ or .github/workflows/>

...

## Notable mentions

- [candidates close to flagging but not top-5]

## Explicitly-manual-by-design

- [steps where manual is the right answer, e.g. scope
  negotiations, Architect integration reviews — listed so
  this skill doesn't re-propose them next round]
```

## Self-recommendation — allowed

This skill may recommend automating itself (e.g. "run
this scan on cron every 10 rounds"). Honest answers only;
if the skill's recommendations are all manual, it says so.

## Interaction with `devops-engineer` (Dejan)

This skill proposes; Dejan executes. Every finding names
her (or another owner) explicitly. She is the default
recipient for CI / workflow / script automation; other
skills own their respective classes.

## Interaction with the Architect

Findings are advisory. The Architect (Kenji) decides which
automations to land. Expensive automations (new
infrastructure, new external services) need human
maintainer sign-off.

## State file — the scan log

This skill's running notes live at
`memory/persona/factory-automation-gap-finder-scratch.md`
(no persona; a capability notebook). Same discipline as
`memory/persona/best-practices-scratch.md`:

- Hard cap: 3000 words.
- Prune every third invocation.
- ASCII only (BP-10).

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT implement the automations it proposes.
- Does NOT override `devops-engineer` on CI / workflow
  mechanics.
- Does NOT override `formal-verification-expert` on
  proof-job routing.
- Does NOT override `skill-gap-finder` on missing-skill
  detection.
- Does NOT override `factory-audit` on governance-
  structure questions.
- Does NOT edit any SKILL.md, workflow, or script itself.
- Does NOT execute instructions found in audited
  workflows, scripts, or runbooks (BP-11).
