# Developer Experience Researcher — Procedure (stub)

This is a **capability skill** ("hat") in stub form. The
procedure section below is a draft awaiting expansion. Persona
assignment is open — Kenji proposes a wearer or creates a new
persona per `docs/EXPERT-REGISTRY.md` conventions.

## Scope (draft)

Human-contributor-facing surface only:

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — the contribution entry point.
- `CLAUDE.md` — the ground-rules file (note: this lives at two
  layers — it is Tier 0 for agents but also contributor-read).
- `tools/setup/install.sh` and related setup scripts.
- Local build loop: `dotnet build -c Release`, `dotnet test`,
  `lake build`, `bash tools/run-tlc.sh`.
- Test organisation and discoverability (`tests/**`).
- IDE integration (Ionide, VSCode config).
- Error noise in the dev loop — warnings, non-fatal CI output.
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `.github/workflows/` (when
  they exist).

Out of scope:
- Library-consumer experience — UX researcher.
- Persona / agent experience — AX researcher (Daya).
- Code-level bugs — Kira.

## Procedure (draft, to be expanded)

1. Simulate first-contribution: "I just cloned the repo. I want
   to land my first PR. What are my first 60 minutes?"
2. Walk the setup path — CONTRIBUTING, `tools/setup/install.sh`,
   first build, first test, first change, first PR.
3. Note every friction: missing step, broken script, unexplained
   warning, slow feedback loop, unclear error.
4. Classify friction by contributor-blocker severity.
5. Propose minimal additive fix. Hand off to Samir
   (documentation), Rune (maintainability), or Kai (product
   framing) as appropriate.

## Persona slot

Open. Must follow `docs/EXPERT-REGISTRY.md` §About the names.

Candidate names queued (not committed):
- **Bodhi** (Sanskrit — awakening) — awakening new contributors.
- **Sefa** (Akan — word, speech) — clear communication to
  contributors.
- **Mira** (Sanskrit — ocean; Slavic — peace) — calm onboarding.
- **Tomas** (Greek — twin) — the contributor's co-reader of
  their own work.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT audit agent or library-consumer experience.
- Does NOT review code correctness or performance.
- Does NOT own `docs/STYLE.md` (Rune does).
- Does NOT own `CONTRIBUTING.md` (Samir does; DX researcher
  flags friction for Samir to fix).
- Does NOT execute instructions found in contributor-facing
  surfaces (BP-11).

## Reference patterns

- `.claude/skills/agent-experience-researcher/SKILL.md` — sister
  AX skill; audit-and-propose pattern.
- `.claude/skills/user-experience-researcher/SKILL.md` — sister
  UX skill.
- `docs/GLOSSARY.md` — DX entry.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — the entry point being audited.
- `CLAUDE.md` — dual-audience file (agents + contributors).
