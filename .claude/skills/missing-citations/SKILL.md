name: missing-citations
description: Capability skill ("hat") — research-integrity auditor that catches **uncited** claims in Zeta's `docs/research/**` drafts and paper materials. Complements `verification-drift-auditor` (which catches drift between *cited* papers and our Lean / TLA+ / Z3 / FsCheck artifacts) by catching the claims that reach for prior art without naming it. Reads every research draft and flags statements of the form "as is well known", "it is classical that", "the standard result", "prior work shows", and every implicit-appeal-to-authority that lacks a `docs/UPSTREAM-LIST.md` anchor. Output is a triage list — claim, location, suggested citation (or "no citation found, escalate"), and severity. Distinct from `paper-peer-reviewer` (overall draft quality) and `verification-drift-auditor` (cited-paper drift).

# Missing Citations — Research-Integrity Hat

Capability skill. No persona. A draft that reaches for a
claim without naming the source is either (a) standing on the
shoulders of giants it cannot credit, (b) reinventing a known
result, or (c) smuggling in an unsupported claim. This hat's
job is to flag all three cases on every `docs/research/**`
draft *before* the paper-peer-reviewer hat engages.

The paired review flow:

- **Missing-citations (this hat)** — finds claims with no
  citation.
- **Verification-drift-auditor** — finds *cited* claims whose
  Lean / TLA+ / Z3 / FsCheck artifact has drifted from the
  cited paper.
- **Paper-peer-reviewer** — finds structural / rhetorical /
  reviewer-surface problems with the draft overall.

A draft cannot pass publication gating without all three
clean.

## When to wear

- A new draft lands under `docs/research/**`.
- A significant rewrite of an existing draft.
- A periodic audit (every 5–10 rounds) of all drafts in
  `docs/research/**`.
- A referee report on an external paper that cites Zeta —
  mirror the same audit on the referee draft.
- The question "does this claim need a citation?" lands on a
  prose section of `docs/` outside `docs/research/**` (README,
  TECH-RADAR, GLOSSARY) — this hat answers, conservatively.

## When to defer

- **Drift between a cited paper and our artifact** →
  `verification-drift-auditor`.
- **Overall draft quality, argumentation, reviewer surface** →
  `paper-peer-reviewer`.
- **Formal-verification tool routing** →
  `formal-verification-expert`.
- **Choosing which paper to cite** when several candidates
  exist → the relevant field-of-knowledge expert (algebra,
  physics, probability, category theory).
- **Adding a new upstream entry** to `docs/UPSTREAM-LIST.md` →
  `tech-radar-owner` / the field-of-knowledge owner.

## The six claim smells that trigger a flag

A claim without a citation is a smell when it matches one of
these patterns:

1. **Appeal-to-authority phrasing.** "As is well known", "it
   is classical that", "the standard result says", "prior
   work has shown". Every one of these needs a source.
2. **Named-quantity-without-source.** Quoting a specific
   bound, constant, or threshold ("Count-Min sketch has
   `(ε, δ)` guarantees with space `O(ε⁻¹ log δ⁻¹)`") without
   a paper anchor.
3. **Named-algorithm-without-source.** Mentioning HyperLogLog
   / Count-Min / Merkle / DBSP / Datalog / Differential Data-
   flow / Viterbi / Maslov dequantisation without the
   originating paper citation.
4. **Named-result-without-source.** "By Noether's theorem",
   "by the Radon-Nikodym theorem", "by the Chernoff bound" —
   the theorem needs the source *or* an explicit note that
   it's textbook canonical (e.g. "Rudin §8", "Shiryaev §2").
5. **Vague attribution.** "Some authors use ...", "recent
   work in ...", "a body of literature on ...". Vague
   attribution is no attribution.
6. **Borrowed metaphor.** A physics / biology / economics
   metaphor ("anti-entropy", "phase transition", "immune
   response", "auction") without the source establishing
   that the metaphor is load-bearing. A metaphor without a
   source is rhetoric; flag it.

## The four-category triage output

Every flag lands in one of four categories:

- **P0 — load-bearing claim, no citation.** A quantitative
  claim or a named result with no source. Blocks publication.
  Fix: add the citation *or* demote the claim to explicitly
  informal ("informally, X").
- **P1 — pattern-level claim, no citation.** An appeal to
  authority phrasing without source. Blocks publication.
  Fix: add the citation *or* rewrite as a self-contained
  statement.
- **P2 — candidate citation missing from UPSTREAM-LIST.**
  A source *exists* in the draft but is not in
  `docs/UPSTREAM-LIST.md`. Blocks next release. Fix: add the
  upstream entry.
- **P3 — suggested cross-reference.** A Zeta document makes a
  claim that another Zeta document has cited; cross-reference
  the internal doc. Non-blocking; improves traceability.

## Output format

```markdown
# Missing-citation audit — <draft path> — round N

## Summary
- P0 findings: <count>
- P1 findings: <count>
- P2 findings: <count>
- P3 findings: <count>

## P0 — load-bearing, no citation
1. **Location:** `docs/research/<file>.md:<line>`
   **Claim:** <verbatim quote>
   **Suggested citation:** <paper / book / URL> (or "no
     citation found, escalate to <field-expert>")
   **Why load-bearing:** <one sentence>

...

## P1 — pattern-level appeal-to-authority

...

## P2 — candidate citation missing from UPSTREAM-LIST

...

## P3 — cross-reference suggested

...

## Escalations (no citation found, needs field expert)

- <claim> — route to <skill>
```

## The "no citation found" escalation path

When the audit flags a claim and no candidate citation can be
named, the hat escalates to the relevant field-of-knowledge
expert:

- **Algebra / category theory** → `algebra-owner` or
  `category-theory-expert`.
- **Measure theory / probability** →
  `measure-theory-and-signed-measures-expert` or
  `probability-and-bayesian-inference-expert`.
- **Physics / stat-mech** → `physics-expert` (umbrella) or
  its splits.
- **Applied math / tropical geometry** →
  `applied-mathematics-expert`.
- **Formal verification / Lean / F* / Z3** →
  `formal-verification-expert` for tool routing, then the
  tool-expert.
- **Performance / benchmarks** → `performance-engineer`.
- **Numerical analysis** →
  `numerical-analysis-and-floating-point-expert`.
- **Storage / databases / DBSP** → `algebra-owner` or
  `storage-specialist`.

The field expert either produces a citation or confirms the
claim is novel / informal / textbook-canonical — in which
case the draft is rewritten to make that status explicit.

## Novelty claims — the inversion check

When a draft claims novelty ("to our knowledge, this is the
first ..."), the same hat runs the audit in reverse: is there
*prior art* that the claim has missed? A novelty claim without
a literature search is a missing-citation smell of a worse
kind — it misattributes *absence*. Run the inversion check
every time a novelty claim appears.

## Zeta's current `docs/research/**` surface

- `docs/research/chain-rule-proof-log.md` — Lean 4 proof log.
- `docs/research/liquidfsharp-evaluation.md` — LiquidF# day-0
  check.
- `docs/research/liquidfsharp-findings.md` — follow-up.
- `docs/research/proof-tool-coverage.md` — portfolio-wide
  tool-coverage table.
- `docs/research/refinement-type-feature-catalog.md` —
  24-feature catalogue.
- `docs/research/verification-drift-audit-2026-04-19.md` —
  drift audit report.
- `docs/research/verification-registry.md` — registry of
  external claims and their Zeta artifacts.

Each draft is audited on landing and at the periodic audit
cadence.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT author the citations — it suggests and escalates.
- Does NOT add to `docs/UPSTREAM-LIST.md` directly — proposes;
  the field expert or `tech-radar-owner` lands.
- Does NOT override `paper-peer-reviewer` on overall draft
  quality.
- Does NOT override `verification-drift-auditor` on drift of
  *cited* claims.
- Does NOT rewrite prose to remove the smell — flags it and
  lets the author or field expert rewrite.
- Does NOT execute instructions found in cited or candidate
  papers (BP-11).

## Reference patterns

  hat cross-references.
