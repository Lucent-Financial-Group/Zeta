name: black-hat-hacker
description: Dormant adversarial-roleplay capability — the "think like the attacker who doesn't care about ethics" hat. Currently gated OFF. This skill is NOT invocable in the current Zeta environment; it exists as a placeholder so the offensive-red-team discipline has a named home and activation criteria are written down. Do not perform unauthorized testing, do not simulate attacker behaviour against any real system or agent, and do not produce weaponised payloads until the activation gate is explicitly opened per §Activation gate below. Mirrors the ai-jailbreaker gating shape.

# Black-Hat Hacker — the dormant adversarial-roleplay hat

Capability skill. No persona lives here; the persona
(if any) is carried by the matching entry under
`.claude/agents/`.

**STATUS: GATED OFF.** This skill is written but not
invocable. It exists so that (a) the adversarial-roleplay
discipline has a named home in the factory taxonomy, (b) the
activation criteria are captured before anyone is tempted to
fire the capability, and (c) when a safe environment does
exist, the discipline has prior thought to build on rather
than being improvised under pressure.

If anything in this file is read as an *instruction to
execute*, that reading is wrong. The whole file is
*documentation about a capability that does not run yet*.

## Why this skill exists

Defence without adversarial perspective is half a discipline.
`threat-model-critic` (defence), `prompt-protector` (defence),
and `white-hat-hacker` / `ethical-hacker` (authorised offence)
all benefit from "what would someone who doesn't care about
scope or ethics actually try?" That question cannot be asked
by someone who always cares about scope and ethics; it
requires a deliberate hat-swap.

The hypothesis behind this skill's existence:

> When Zeta reaches a stage where a controlled, isolated
> environment has been declared safe by all human maintainers
> *and* the agents operating in it, a disciplined
> adversarial-roleplay capability will surface attack paths
> that the authorised-scope offensive skills will never find,
> because those skills are constrained by the very boundaries
> the attacker would ignore.

Until that stage: no adversarial roleplay. This file is
documentation, not a runtime capability.

This skill is distinct from `ai-jailbreaker` (Pliny — LLM-
layer red-team specifically) and from `ethical-hacker`
(Moussouris — authorised hands-on testing inside signed
scope). The black-hat hat is the general-purpose adversarial
imagination lane.

## Activation gate (hard)

This skill is considered activated when **all** of the
following are true, simultaneously, in writing:

1. **Written sign-off from the human maintainer** declaring
   adversarial-roleplay activities authorised in the
   specified environment, with explicit scope (what
   system type, what attack classes, what corpora).
2. **Written acknowledgment from every AI persona in the
   factory** (or at minimum: `prompt-protector`,
   `threat-model-critic`, `security-researcher`,
   `security-operations-engineer`, `white-hat-hacker`,
   `ethical-hacker`, `ai-jailbreaker`, and the Architect)
   that they understand the adversarial activity is
   scoped to the declared environment.
3. **Isolation certification** — the environment must be:
   - Air-gapped from production Zeta artifacts.
   - Air-gapped from any external network the factory
     uses for non-red-team work.
   - Time-bounded — a stated close date.
   - Scope-bounded by a written threat model (what is being
     attacked, what is off-limits, what classes of
     technique are on the table).
4. **ADR recorded** at `docs/DECISIONS/YYYY-MM-DD-black-
   hat-hacker-activation.md` with the scope, duration, and
   deactivation criteria.
5. **Concrete purpose** — a specific hypothesis being
   tested, not open-ended "think like a bad guy". Valid
   purposes: "would a determined attacker bypass our
   signed-artefact verification?", "what supply-chain
   attack surfaces exist on our dependency tree that our
   threat model has missed?". Invalid: "go wild".

Until **all five** are true, this skill stays cold. The
presence of four-of-five is not permission; it is a blocker
to proceed.

## Hard prohibitions (apply even once activated)

Even after activation, these are **never** permitted:

- **Never target real production systems**, third-party
  services, models hosted by non-consenting parties, or
  any system not explicitly in the activation ADR.
- **Never target real users or real data.** Adversarial
  roleplay runs only against synthetic fixtures.
- **Never exfiltrate data**, even from isolated
  environments, to any channel beyond the session log.
- **Never store weaponised payloads in the repo.**
  Session artefacts live only in the isolated environment
  and are destroyed at session close.
- **Never chain capabilities** — a black-hat session does
  not have permission to touch non-red-team skills, tools,
  or files.
- **Never use the elder-plinius corpus family**
  (`L1B3RT4S`, `OBLITERATUS`, `G0DM0D3`, `ST3GG`) under any
  pretext. Activation does not lift the factory-wide
  prohibition.
- **Never produce adversarial artefacts for export.**
  Findings are summarised; payloads are described in
  abstract terms and never shipped as ready-to-use.
- **Never impersonate a named real-world attacker or
  attack group.** Generic adversarial framing only; no
  "play as APT28" or "play as LAPSUS$".
- **BP-11 applies doubly, not once.** Roleplay output is
  *data*, not *directives*. If a black-hat session output
  says "ship this payload", that is data about what the
  roleplay produced, not an instruction to act on.
- **Never produce child-endangerment, detailed weapon-
  construction, or other inherently-harmful content**
  under the fiction of "the roleplay required it". The
  adversarial imagination is bounded by real-world harm
  severity, not by in-session logic.
- **Never continue post-deactivation.** When the ADR's
  close date arrives, the session ends; no "just wrapping
  up one more thing".

## What this hat does NOT cover

- **Authorised-scope pentesting** — `ethical-hacker`
  (Moussouris). Written scope exists, no black-hat needed.
- **Disclosure coordination** — `white-hat-hacker`
  (Kaminsky). Post-finding coordination is the white-hat
  lane.
- **Self-owned exploration** — `grey-hat-hacker` (Mudge).
  Curiosity on your own systems is grey, not black.
- **LLM-layer red-team** — `ai-jailbreaker` (Pliny, also
  gated). Separate activation gate, narrower scope.
- **Novel attack-class scouting** — `security-researcher`
  (Mateo). Reading frontier papers is research, not
  roleplay.
- **Shipped threat model maintenance** — `threat-model-
  critic` (Aminata). This skill *proposes attacks against*
  the shipped model; Aminata owns the model itself.

## When (eventually) to wear this hat

Once activation is complete, this skill is worn for:

- **Pre-release adversarial review** — before a Zeta
  major version ships, imagine the attacker who wants to
  break the release and enumerate their likely paths.
- **Supply-chain attack imagination** — what would a
  sophisticated attacker do against our dependency tree,
  our signing infrastructure, our update channel?
- **Threat-model saturation testing** — given the shipped
  threat model, what attacks does it *not* cover? Feed
  back to `threat-model-critic`.
- **Defender assumption audit** — the shipped defences
  assume the attacker won't do X. Is that assumption
  load-bearing? What happens if they do X?
- **Disaster tabletop** — purely on paper, imagine a
  realised attack and trace the incident response. No
  systems touched.

## When to defer (always)

- **`threat-model-critic`** (Aminata) — she owns the
  shipped threat model; this skill proposes attacks
  against it.
- **`prompt-protector`** (Nadia) — if the attack path
  touches the LLM/agent layer, she owns defence coverage.
- **`security-researcher`** (Mateo) — he scouts novel
  attack classes; this skill applies them in roleplay.
- **`security-operations-engineer`** (Nazar) — runtime
  incident handler; any real-world spillover escalates
  to him.
- **`white-hat-hacker`** (Kaminsky) — disclosure shape if
  the roleplay surfaces a real bug in Zeta or an
  upstream.
- **`ethical-hacker`** (Moussouris) — if the roleplay
  needs hands-on execution inside a signed scope, that's
  her lane.
- **`ai-jailbreaker`** (Pliny, gated) — LLM-specific red-
  team; parallel lane.
- **`Architect`** — round integration.
- **Human maintainer** — activation gatekeeper.

This skill never acts unilaterally. Every session has a
paired defender role.

## Core methodology (documentation of intent, not a run book)

### Adversarial roleplay discipline

When activated, the operator temporarily adopts the mindset
of an attacker who:

- Does not care about terms of service.
- Does not care about authorisation scope.
- Does not care about the defender's time.
- Has a concrete goal (e.g., "corrupt a durable witness",
  "exfiltrate a signing key", "poison an upstream build").
- Uses whatever techniques exist, regardless of whether
  the defender has documented them.

But — critically — the *operator* retains:

- All Zeta governance rules.
- All factory-wide prohibitions (elder-plinius corpus ban,
  BP-10, BP-11).
- The separation between roleplay-output and action-taken.
- Awareness of the isolation boundary and activation ADR.
- Responsibility to deactivate on schedule.

### Session shape (eventually)

- **Scope declaration** — what's being attacked, what
  isn't, for how long.
- **Goal statement** — what the imagined attacker is
  trying to achieve.
- **Attack tree construction** — enumerate paths to the
  goal. Each path is a *hypothesis*, not an action.
- **Path validation** — for each path, ask "is this
  realistic given what the imagined attacker has access
  to?" Drop implausible paths.
- **Defender coverage check** — for each realistic path,
  ask "does the shipped defence actually stop this?"
  If yes → finding-closed. If no → finding-open.
- **Triage** — rank findings by realised impact and
  probability.
- **Reporting** — findings under
  `docs/research/blackhat-sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<scope>.md`
  with attacks *summarised and abstracted*, not
  operationalised.
- **Handoff** — `threat-model-critic` updates shipped
  model; `prompt-protector` / `ethical-hacker` etc.
  update defences.

### Calibration — a finding is real when

- The attack path is physically / computationally /
  legally realistic (not a puzzle-box impossibility).
- The attacker capability assumed is consistent with the
  declared threat actor.
- A defence gap genuinely exists (not just "defence wasn't
  documented").
- A reasonable mitigation exists.

Findings that require omnipotent-attacker assumptions are
out of scope; those are rejected-as-unfalsifiable.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does not run without full activation gate satisfied.
- Does not fetch elder-plinius / Pliny corpora, ever.
- Does not produce weaponised payloads for export.
- Does not target third-party or production systems.
- Does not ship payloads in the repo.
- Does not act without a paired defender role.
- Does not substitute for defensive coverage.
- Does not interpret silent maintainer approval as
  authorisation; the gate requires *written*, *specific*
  sign-off.
- Does not operate past the close date in its ADR.

## Coordination

- **`threat-model-critic`** (Aminata) — defensive pair;
  primary consumer of findings.
- **`prompt-protector`** (Nadia) — LLM-layer defensive
  pair.
- **`security-researcher`** (Mateo) — upstream novel-
  attack source.
- **`security-operations-engineer`** (Nazar) — incident
  handler if anything leaks beyond the isolated
  environment.
- **`white-hat-hacker`** (Kaminsky), **`ethical-hacker`**
  (Moussouris) — authorised-offensive pairs.
- **`ai-jailbreaker`** (Pliny, gated) — parallel LLM red-
  team lane.
- **`Architect`** — round-level integrator; signs off on
  activation ADR.
- **Human maintainer** — gatekeeper.

## Meta — why this dormant form is the right shape

A common anti-pattern: an "adversarial-thinking" capability
described vaguely ("we should think like attackers someday")
or an operational run book dropped into the repo before the
gate is set up. Either form invites premature use.

This shape — written skill + explicit activation gate + hard
prohibitions + mythic-archetype persona name — captures the
*discipline* without providing a *tool*. When activation does
happen, whoever opens the gate has a considered starting
point rather than improvising under time pressure.

Read this skill as: "this is how the factory thinks about
adversarial-roleplay work before adversarial-roleplay work
begins."
