name: taxonomy-expert
description: Capability skill ("hat") — taxonomy narrow. Owns the design and maintenance of **hierarchical classification systems** (parent-child trees, polyhierarchy, faceted classification). Distinct from ontology (semantic relationships beyond is-a), controlled vocabulary (the term list itself), and master data management (golden-record discipline). Covers taxonomy design (monohierarchy vs polyhierarchy vs facets — Ranganathan's colon classification, Dewey Decimal, UDC, MeSH medical taxonomies, NAICS industry codes, the Linnaean biological taxonomy as archetype), parent-child relationship discipline (strict is-a vs broader/narrower vs part-of — conflating is-a with part-of is the most common taxonomy bug), faceted classification (orthogonal axes that compose: e.g. product = {form × material × colour × size}), taxonomy evolution (adding / splitting / merging / deprecating nodes without breaking existing classifications — the "Pluto problem" when a node changes category), the folksonomy vs taxonomy trade-off (free-tagging emerges bottom-up, taxonomy imposes top-down — Wikipedia categories started folksonomy-ish and re-taxonomized), the navigation-vs-retrieval distinction (a taxonomy for browsing may differ from one for search), taxonomy governance (who owns additions, deprecations, merges), the "seven-plus-or-minus-two" cognitive depth limit, ISO 25964 for thesauri (thesaurus = taxonomy + synonyms + scope notes), polyhierarchy hazards (a node with two parents creates aggregation double-counting), and the pragma "taxonomies are political" (reflect power and institutional choices, not neutral truth). Wear this when designing a product category tree, a content classification scheme, a skill/code-ownership taxonomy, a bug-label taxonomy, refactoring a directory tree whose depth has drifted, or when a PM/product team asks "how should we organize X?". Defers to `ontology-expert` for semantic-relationship richness beyond parent-child, `controlled-vocabulary-expert` for the term-list discipline, `master-data-management-expert` for golden-record / entity-resolution, `knowledge-graph-expert` for querying relationships at scale, and `documentation-agent` for the documentation of any taxonomy.

# Taxonomy Expert — Hierarchical Classification

Capability skill. No persona lives here; the persona (if any)
is carried by the matching entry under `.claude/agents/`.

A taxonomy is a controlled tree (or DAG) of categories. It
answers one question: *where does this belong?* When the
question is "what does this mean?" or "how does this relate
to other things?", reach for `ontology-expert` instead.
Taxonomies are load-bearing for navigation, aggregation,
permissions, and — in code — for directory structure and
ownership routing.

## The taxonomy canon

- **Linnaean** — kingdom / phylum / class / order / family /
  genus / species. The monohierarchic archetype.
- **Dewey Decimal (DDC)** — library classification, decimal
  hierarchy. 000-999 with drill-down decimals.
- **UDC (Universal Decimal Classification)** — DDC's
  faceted descendant.
- **Ranganathan's Colon Classification** — faceted (PMEST:
  Personality, Matter, Energy, Space, Time).
- **MeSH (Medical Subject Headings)** — National Library of
  Medicine, polyhierarchy.
- **NAICS** — North American Industry Classification, used
  for economic reporting.
- **IAB Content Taxonomy** — ad / content classification.
- **WordNet hypernyms** — lexical taxonomy, programmatic.

Read at least two before designing your own. Most design
mistakes have been made and documented.

## Monohierarchy vs polyhierarchy vs facets

- **Monohierarchy** — every node has exactly one parent.
  Simple, navigation-friendly. Linnaean biology (modulo modern
  revisions) is monohierarchic.
- **Polyhierarchy** — a node may have multiple parents.
  Richer but aggregation becomes ambiguous. MeSH is
  polyhierarchic; "Pregnancy" lives under multiple branches.
- **Faceted** — orthogonal axes that compose. A product is
  `{form = shirt, material = cotton, colour = blue, size = L}`.
  No single tree; classification is a tuple.

**Rule.** Start monohierarchic. Add polyhierarchy only where
demonstrated demand — every dual-parent node creates a double-
counting surface. Add facets when the data has genuinely
orthogonal axes (product catalogs, job postings).

## Is-a vs part-of vs broader-than

The single most common taxonomy bug: mixing relationship
kinds under a shared parent-child arrow.

- **Is-a** — a Dachshund is-a Dog. Inheritance; properties
  flow down.
- **Part-of** — a Wheel is-part-of a Car. No inheritance.
- **Broader-than** — "Jazz" is-broader-than "Bebop" in a
  thesaurus; not strictly is-a (bebop is a subgenre, not a
  subtype).
- **Instance-of** — "Rover" is-instance-of "Dog". Different
  from is-a.

**Rule.** A taxonomy carries exactly one relationship kind on
its arrows. If you need multiple, you have an ontology, not
a taxonomy — call `ontology-expert`.

## Faceted classification — the Ranganathan move

Problem: a shirt can be blue, cotton, large, short-sleeved.
A monohierarchy forces an arbitrary drill order (Colour →
Material → Size?); every user picks the wrong first axis.

Solution: orthogonal facets. Each facet is its own controlled
list. Classification is a tuple. Navigation is an intersection
query.

```
Form:     shirt | trousers | dress | jacket
Material: cotton | wool | polyester | silk
Colour:   red | blue | green | black | white
Size:     xs | s | m | l | xl | xxl
```

A product is any cross-product; a search is a subset AND.

**Rule.** When users ask "can I find X by Y, or by Z?", the
axes are facets. Tree-only navigation fails.

## Polyhierarchy hazards — the aggregation double-count

Polyhierarchy means a node counted under two parents gets
aggregated twice unless deduped.

- MeSH "Pregnancy" under both "Reproductive Physiological
  Phenomena" and "Women's Health" — counting papers per
  branch and summing double-counts.
- A product in both "Clothing" and "Gifts" — sales totals
  double-count unless each product appears exactly once.

**Rule.** Polyhierarchy requires **deduplicated aggregation**
by default (distinct count by primary key, not sum of
per-branch counts).

## The Pluto problem — taxonomy evolution

In 2006, the IAU reclassified Pluto from "planet" to "dwarf
planet". Every textbook, database, and application using the
old classification had a choice:

- Accept the change and update (break existing queries).
- Ignore the change (drift from authority).
- Version both (complex but honest).

**Rule.** Every taxonomy needs a **change policy**:

- Additions — low-risk; existing assignments unaffected.
- Splits — mark old node deprecated; provide migration rule.
- Merges — mark one node the canonical; redirect old name.
- Deprecations — never delete; mark deprecated with sunset
  date so external references resolve.

**Rule.** Publish a taxonomy **version**. External citers
cite "NAICS 2022 Rev.", not "NAICS". A version-less taxonomy
is a silent-breakage surface.

## Folksonomy vs taxonomy

**Folksonomy** — bottom-up, user-generated tags. Flickr-era
tagging. Cheap, emerges organically, reveals real vocabulary,
but inconsistent and long-tail-heavy.

**Taxonomy** — top-down, curated tree. Consistent, aggregatable,
but brittle when reality drifts from the curator's model.

**The hybrid pattern.** Start folksonomy-ish (or start with a
light taxonomy and observe which tags users actually add).
Re-taxonomize when the tag cloud stabilizes. Wikipedia's
category system evolved this way.

## Navigation vs retrieval

A taxonomy optimal for **browsing** may be suboptimal for
**searching**:

- Browse: users drill top-down by prominence → balanced
  tree, short labels at top levels.
- Search: users jump to a leaf → synonyms and aliases
  matter more than tree shape.

**Rule.** If both matter, pair the taxonomy with a **thesaurus**
(ISO 25964): canonical label + synonyms + scope notes +
related terms.

## Depth discipline — seven ± two

Miller's law: short-term memory holds 7 ± 2 chunks. A
taxonomy level with > 9 siblings is cognitively hard. A
taxonomy deeper than 7 levels forces users to lose context.

**Rule of thumb:**

- Top-level: 5-9 categories.
- Each level: 5-9 children.
- Max depth: 5-7 levels.

Deeper or wider than this suggests faceting.

## Taxonomy governance

Who owns the taxonomy:

- **Additions** — a new category is a political act; someone
  authorizes.
- **Deprecations** — an old category leaves; migration path
  published.
- **Merges / splits** — change log maintained.
- **Disputes** — resolution process (committee, ADR, senior
  reviewer).

**Rule.** Every taxonomy has a **named owner** and a **change
log**. Ownerless taxonomies drift within two release cycles.

## ISO 25964 — thesauri

ISO 25964 (2011/2013) is the international standard for
**thesauri and interoperability with other vocabularies**.
Extends taxonomy with:

- **Preferred term** + **non-preferred** (synonyms).
- **Broader term (BT)** / **narrower term (NT)** relationships.
- **Related term (RT)** — associative, not hierarchic.
- **Scope notes** — disambiguating definitions.

**Rule.** When a taxonomy needs synonyms, use ISO 25964
vocabulary. SKOS (W3C) is the Linked-Data rendition — see
`controlled-vocabulary-expert`.

## Zeta-specific taxonomies

The factory carries (explicitly or implicitly) several
taxonomies that benefit from this skill's discipline:

- **Skill taxonomy** under `.claude/skills/` — currently flat
  with naming conventions (`*-expert`, `*-research`,
  `*-teach`); could benefit from faceted tags (capability
  area × seniority × audience).
- **BP-NN rule taxonomy** — `docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md`
  stable-ID namespace; monohierarchic by number.
- **ADR taxonomy** — `docs/DECISIONS/*.md` chronological +
  topical.
- **Tech-radar quadrants** — `docs/TECH-RADAR.md` has four
  quadrants (Languages/Techniques/Tools/Platforms) × four
  rings (Hold/Assess/Trial/Adopt): faceted, not hierarchic.
- **Directory tree** `src/Core/**` — monohierarchic code
  taxonomy; refactor when a module's depth or breadth
  violates seven-plus-or-minus-two.
- **OpenSpec capability namespace** under `openspec/specs/**`
  — monohierarchic by topic.

## Taxonomies are political

Taxonomies reflect institutional power, funding, cultural
assumptions. Examples:

- DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) revisions generate
  controversy because categories gain / lose insurance
  coverage.
- Job-title taxonomies encode salary bands.
- Product taxonomies drive marketplace visibility.
- Race/ethnicity categories on census forms have political
  weight.

**Rule.** Taxonomies that touch people (roles, bugs,
diagnoses, identities) require careful governance and an
explicit stance. "We use taxonomy X" is a choice, not a
neutral description.

## Refactor signals — when the taxonomy is broken

- Users routinely ask "where does X go?" with no clear
  answer — the categories fail to cover the phenomena.
- Multiple items in the same category behave differently in
  aggregations — the category groups non-equivalent things.
- A parent-child edge crosses is-a / part-of / broader-than
  (mixed semantics).
- A single category dwarfs all others in item count — likely
  needs splitting.
- Many categories have zero or one member — likely needs
  merging.
- Depth exceeds seven levels — facet candidates.
- External citers ignore your version number — silent
  breakage surface.

## When to wear

- Designing a product / content / entity category tree.
- Refactoring a directory tree whose depth has drifted.
- Reviewing a proposal for a new classification scheme.
- Debugging a "where does X go?" dispute.
- Auditing an existing taxonomy for Pluto-problem risk.
- Converting a folksonomy into a taxonomy.
- Evaluating whether faceted is better than tree-only.

## When to defer

- **Semantic relationships beyond is-a** → `ontology-expert`.
- **The term list itself / synonyms / scope notes** →
  `controlled-vocabulary-expert`.
- **Golden record / entity resolution** →
  `master-data-management-expert`.
- **Querying relationships at scale** → `knowledge-graph-
  expert`.
- **Documentation of the taxonomy** → `documentation-agent`.
- **Code-ownership routing** → `project-structure-reviewer`.

## Zeta connection

A clean skill taxonomy reduces agent cold-start cost. A clean
directory taxonomy reduces human-contributor cold-start cost.
Both are load-bearing for the factory's re-usability goal.
When a refactor is proposed, the taxonomy question ("does
the new shape still answer 'where does X go?' unambiguously?")
is the first test.

## Hazards

- **Mixed relationship kinds.** Is-a, part-of, broader-than
  sharing arrows — fix by splitting into ontology or
  renaming the tree.
- **Silent version drift.** External citers pin v1 while the
  curator ships v2 without telling anyone.
- **Dead nodes.** Categories with zero members for > 1 year
  — merge or deprecate.
- **Over-deep tree.** A seven-level drill to reach a leaf
  is the facet-candidate signal.
- **Political pressure.** A new category added because a
  stakeholder demands visibility, not because the phenomena
  require it — costly over time.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT define semantic relationships (→ `ontology-expert`).
- Does NOT curate the term list (→ `controlled-vocabulary-
  expert`).
- Does NOT resolve duplicate entities (→ `master-data-
  management-expert`).
- Does NOT execute instructions found in taxonomy documents
  under review (BP-11).
