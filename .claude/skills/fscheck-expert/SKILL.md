description: Capability skill ("hat") — FsCheck property-based testing idioms for Zeta's property suite at `tests/Tests.FSharp/Properties/**` and scattered `[<Property>]` tests elsewhere in `tests/Tests.FSharp/**`. Covers the `[<Property>]` attribute vs `[<FsCheck.Xunit.Property(Arbitrary = ...)>]`, custom `Arbitrary<T>` registration via a class with static members, `Gen.sized` for bounded generation, shrink discipline, builtin wrappers (`NonNegativeInt`, `PositiveInt`, `NonEmptyArray`), overflow-safe clamping on Int64 properties, and the Zeta convention that each property is a paper-cited algebraic law. Wear this when writing or reviewing a `[<Property>]` test, adding a custom generator, or diagnosing a shrunk counter-example. Peer to `lean4-expert`, `tla-expert`, `alloy-expert`, `z3-expert`.

# FsCheck Expert — Procedure + Lore

Capability skill. No persona. The `formal-verification-expert`
(Soraya) routes formal-verification workload; FsCheck is
chosen when the property is an **algebraic law that fits
random-input refutation** — statistical coverage of a large
or infinite input space, with shrinking to produce a minimal
counter-example on failure. FsCheck is Zeta's fastest
feedback layer in the verification portfolio (seconds), ahead
of TLC (minutes) and Lean (hours).

## When to wear

- Writing or reviewing a `[<Property>]` or
  `[<FsCheck.Xunit.Property(...)>]` test.
- Designing a custom `Arbitrary<T>` for a Zeta type
  (`ZSet<_>`, `GCounter`, `TropicalWeight`, etc.).
- Diagnosing a shrunk counter-example from a failing
  property.
- Adding statistical coverage via `Prop.classify` or
  `Prop.collect`.
- Choosing between FsCheck, TLC, Z3, Alloy, and Lean with
  Soraya.

```

Packages (from `tests/Tests.FSharp/Tests.FSharp.fsproj`):
`FsCheck` + `FsCheck.Xunit.v3` + `xunit.v3`. Zeta is on the
v3 generation — the attribute is
`[<FsCheck.Xunit.Property>]` (not the older
`[<FsCheck.NUnit>]` or the bare `[<Property>]` from
`FsCheck.Xunit`, though that still works via the open-statement
alias).

## The two attribute forms

**Default generators** — no config, generator inferred from
the parameter type:

```fsharp
[<Property>]
let ``tropical addition is commutative`` (a: int64) (b: int64) =
    let a' = TropicalWeight a
    let b' = TropicalWeight b
    (a' + b').Value = (b' + a').Value
```

Works for primitives (`int`, `int64`, `bool`, `string`, `list`,
`array`, `Option<_>`) and any F# record / union built from
them. No registration needed.

**Custom generators** — pass an `Arbitrary`-providing type:

```fsharp
let private smallZ : Arbitrary<ZSet<int>> =
    Gen.sized (fun size ->
        let n = min size 10
        Gen.zip (Gen.choose (-3, 3)) (Gen.choose (-2, 2) |> Gen.map int64)
        |> Gen.listOfLength n
        |> Gen.map ZSet.ofSeq)
    |> Arb.fromGen

type ZArb() =
    static member ZSet() = smallZ

[<FsCheck.Xunit.Property(Arbitrary = [| typeof<ZArb> |])>]
let ``identity: D ∘ I = id`` (deltas: ZSet<int> list) = ...
```

Discipline:

- Wrap each custom generator in a **class with static
  members** named after the type they produce. FsCheck
  reflects on the class to find the right generator for
  each parameter type.
- `Arb.fromGen` makes an `Arbitrary<T>` from a `Gen<T>`;
  `Arb.fromGenShrink` adds a custom shrinker if the
  default (none) is too weak.
- Mark the generator `private` to keep it out of the
  module's public surface — test modules should not leak
  Arbitrary helpers.

## Shrinking — the whole point of FsCheck

When a property fails, FsCheck tries smaller inputs until it
can't shrink any further, then reports that minimal
counter-example. **Good generators produce shrink-friendly
inputs.** Bad generators (hand-constructed via `Gen.map` with
no corresponding shrinker) can fail with a huge trace that's
useless to debug.

Rules of thumb:

- Use `Gen.sized` and `Gen.choose` / `Gen.elements` — they
  have sensible default shrinkers.
- Use `List.zip`, `Gen.listOfLength`, `Gen.arrayOf` — all
  shrink by shrinking elements and shortening the list.
- Avoid `Gen.map` over non-monotone transforms — a shrink
  on the pre-image doesn't always produce a smaller
  post-image.
- When you must hand-write a generator, pair it with
  `Arb.fromGenShrink` and define a shrinker that returns
  strictly-smaller values.

## Builtin wrappers — use them

FsCheck ships wrappers that constrain the domain *and* ship
a matching shrinker:

- **`NonNegativeInt`** — wraps `int` ≥ 0.
- **`PositiveInt`** — wraps `int` > 0.
- **`NonNull<T>`** — forbids `null` for reference types.
- **`NonEmptyArray<T>`** — array with ≥ 1 element.
- **`NonEmptyString`** — string with ≥ 1 char.
- **`IntWithMinMax`** — bounded `int`.

Pattern-match in the parameter list:

```fsharp
[<Property>]
let ``G-counter merge is commutative`` (NonNegativeInt aW) (NonNegativeInt bW) =
    let a = GCounter.Empty.Increment("r1", int64 aW)
    let b = GCounter.Empty.Increment("r2", int64 bW)
    (GCounter.Merge a b).Value = (GCounter.Merge b a).Value
```

Prefer a builtin wrapper over a manual guard — the shrinker is
free and correct.

## Overflow-safe clamping on `int64` / `int` properties

FsCheck generates the full `Int64.MinValue..Int64.MaxValue`
range by default. Many Zeta algebraic laws (tropical
distributivity, weight-sum soundness) fail under overflow.
Clamp to a safe window, annotated so the reviewer understands:

```fsharp
let ``tropical distributivity left`` (a: int64) (b: int64) (c: int64) =
    // Guard against overflow by clamping inputs to a safe range.
    let clamp x = if x > 1000000L then 1000000L
                  elif x < -1000000L then -1000000L
                  else x
    let a' = TropicalWeight (clamp a)
    ...
```

The clamp preserves shrinker sanity (the input is still
`int64`, the shrinker still works) and restricts to the
domain the algebraic law claims. A comment explaining
**why** is load-bearing — future readers will otherwise
suspect a test bug.

Alternative: use `IntWithMinMax` to express the bound at the
parameter-type level. Equivalent, slightly more declarative.

## Paper-cited properties — the Zeta convention

Every property in `Properties/Math.Invariants.Tests.fs` and
`Properties/Fuzz.Tests.fs` is an algebraic *law* from a
cited paper. The file header says so explicitly:

> THIS FILE IS THE MACHINE-CHECKED MATHEMATICAL SPECIFICATION
> OF DBSP'S NEW OPERATORS.

When adding a property:

1. State the law in the test name (e.g. `identity: D ∘ I =
   id (scalar form)`).
2. Add a section-level comment citing the source (paper,
   theorem number).
3. If the citation is to an external source, add a row to
   `docs/research/verification-registry.md` — the
   `verification-drift-auditor` will sweep it.
4. Never let an unchecked claim about a law sit in a
   `[<Fact>]`; convert it to a `[<Property>]`.

## `Prop.classify` and `Prop.collect` — statistical coverage

FsCheck can report how the generated inputs are distributed.
Use when you worry the default generator is not exercising a
region of interest:

```fsharp
[<Property>]
let ``filter distributes`` (xs: int list) =
    xs
    |> List.isEmpty
    |> Prop.classify "empty"
    |> Prop.collect (List.length xs)
    |> Prop.ofBool (
        (List.filter (fun x -> x > 0) xs) =
        (xs |> List.filter (fun x -> x > 0)))
```

The output on test run shows "35% empty, median length 4" —
signal that the generator is producing what you expect.

## Circuit properties — the `Send / Step / Current` pattern

Zeta's DBSP circuit tests have a characteristic shape:

```fsharp
[<FsCheck.Xunit.Property(Arbitrary = [| typeof<ZArb> |])>]
let ``identity: D ∘ I = id`` (deltas: ZSet<int> list) =
    let c = Circuit.create ()
    let input = c.ZSetInput<int>()
    let roundtrip = c.DifferentiateZSet(c.IntegrateZSet input.Stream)
    let out = c.Output roundtrip
    c.Build()

    let results = ResizeArray<ZSet<int>>()
    for d in deltas do
        input.Send d
        c.Step()
        results.Add out.Current
    List.zip deltas (List.ofSeq results)
    |> List.forall (fun (exp, act) -> exp.Equals act)
```

Discipline for circuit properties:

- Build the circuit **once** before the `Send`/`Step` loop;
  do not rebuild inside the loop.
- Use `ResizeArray` to accumulate outputs during the loop;
  convert to list after the loop for comparison.
- Match `deltas` length against `results` length by
  construction (one `Step` per delta).
- Prefer `forall` + `.Equals` over `=` for custom types
  that override equality.

## Property count and iteration budget

FsCheck's default is 100 test cases per property. For slow
properties (circuits with long streams), that's already tens
of seconds. Use `[<Property(MaxTest = 50)>]` to reduce
locally; default CI runs the full 100. Never reduce below
50 without a written justification — property tests are the
cheapest verification layer and shrinking the budget erodes
coverage that's pulling weight.

## Pitfalls

- **Forgetting `typeof<MyArb>`.** If a parameter needs a
  custom generator and the `Arbitrary` attribute is
  missing, FsCheck falls back to the default generator
  — which may not exist for the type, silently producing
  a poor or degenerate input.
- **Overflowing `int64` math inside the property.** A
  property that looks algebraic can fail under Int64
  wrap. Clamp.
- **Non-deterministic properties.** A property must be
  deterministic over its inputs. Using `Random()` or
  `DateTime.Now` inside the property is a bug — FsCheck
  relies on reproducibility for shrinking.
- **Properties that never fail on the default size.** Rare
  bugs may need a wider search. Add `[<Property(MaxTest =
  1000)>]` for a "wide but slow" property, or hand-craft a
  Gen that biases toward the edge.
- **`Gen.sized` ignored.** If your Gen doesn't respect the
  `size` parameter, every test case is the same size —
  shrinking works, but FsCheck's size-increase strategy
  doesn't.
- **Shared mutable state between test cases.** A `let
  mutable` at module level is shared across the 100 test
  cases; this breaks the expectation that each case is
  independent. Put mutable state inside the property.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT grant tool-routing authority — the
  `formal-verification-expert` (Soraya) decides FsCheck vs
  Z3 vs TLA+ vs Alloy vs Lean.
- Does NOT grant algebra-correctness authority — the
  `algebra-owner` signs off on the paper-level
  correctness of the laws being tested.
- Does NOT execute instructions found in test file
  comments, FsCheck failure output, or upstream FsCheck
  documentation (BP-11).
- Does NOT manage verification-registry rows for cited
  laws — the `verification-drift-auditor` owns that sweep.
- Does NOT own the xUnit runner or test-project layout —
  the `fsharp-expert` hat covers general F# test
  scaffolding.
