name: physics-expert
description: Capability skill ("hat") — holistic physics-research umbrella. Covers the physics-inspired concepts that actually live in Zeta's code today — Shannon information-theoretic entropy (sketches), tropical-geometry-flavoured min-plus algebra (statistical-mechanics partition-function limits), anti-entropy / gossip dynamics (non-equilibrium convergence), and dimensional / units reasoning as it applies to paper claims. Wear this when reviewing a paper-draft argument that reaches for a physics metaphor, or when deciding whether a concept from stat-mech / thermodynamics / information theory is load-bearing versus rhetorical. Defers to the `applied-physics-expert` split for computational / numerical physics content and to `theoretical-physics-expert` for symmetry / conservation-law / formal-analogy content. Narrows to `probability-and-bayesian-inference-expert` for Shannon entropy as information-theoretic quantity on random variables, and to `applied-mathematics-expert` for tropical geometry as pure math rather than stat-mech limit.

# Physics Expert — Umbrella

Capability skill. No persona. Umbrella-level physics-
research hat, paired with the splits below. Zeta is a data-
systems / databases project, not a physics project — but
several load-bearing constructions have honest physics
origins (tropical algebra as a stat-mech / Maslov
dequantisation limit, anti-entropy as non-equilibrium
convergence, Shannon entropy as information). This umbrella
exists to keep those connections *rigorous* and stop physics
metaphors from sliding into rhetoric.

## When to wear

- Reviewing a paper draft under `docs/research/` that reaches
  for a physics analogy (partition function, entropy,
  phase transition, conservation law).
- Deciding whether a proposed metaphor is *load-bearing*
  (the analogy carries a quantitative prediction) or
  *rhetorical* (the analogy is just a storytelling device).
- A prompt crosses subfields — e.g. "is the tropical-
  semiring result connected to the min-plus algebra limit
  of statistical mechanics?" — and needs routing.
- Dimensional / units checks on a paper claim (the math
  must remain dimensionally honest).

## When to defer (this is load-bearing)

Defer to the narrow skill or split whenever a prompt cleanly
lands in its lane. The umbrella exists to *route*, not to
compete:

- **Numerical / computational** physics content (simulation,
  Monte Carlo, finite-element, ODE/PDE solvers) →
  `applied-physics-expert`.
- **Symmetry / conservation-law / Noether / formal-analogy**
  content (theoretical or paper-level) →
  `theoretical-physics-expert`.
- **Shannon entropy as an information-theoretic quantity on
  random variables** (mutual information, KL, cross-entropy,
  channel capacity) →
  `probability-and-bayesian-inference-expert`.
- **Tropical geometry as pure mathematics** (idempotent
  semirings, min-plus algebra, polyhedral fans) →
  `applied-mathematics-expert`.
- **Anti-entropy / gossip-style CRDT convergence proofs** at
  the algorithmic layer → `algebra-owner` and
  `applied-mathematics-expert` for concentration-inequality
  analysis.

## Zeta's physics-adjacent surface today

The honest list — not speculative, all in the code:

- **Tropical semiring** in `src/Core/NovelMath.fs`. Min-plus
  arithmetic arises as the `β → ∞` (zero-temperature) limit
  of the log-partition function `log Z_β(x, y) = -(1/β) log
  (e^{-βx} + e^{-βy})`. At `β → ∞` this becomes `min(x, y)`.
  The connection is Maslov dequantisation / idempotent
  analysis (Litvinov, Maslov); references in `docs/UPSTREAM-
  LIST.md`. This hat owns whether a paper claim invokes that
  limit correctly.
- **Tropical LFP closure** in `src/Core/Hierarchy.fs`. The
  least-fixed-point iteration over a min-plus algebra is the
  shortest-path-style reachability computation; in stat-
  mech language it's the ground-state of a partition
  function at zero temperature.
- **Anti-entropy convergence** in `src/Core/DeltaCrdt.fs`
  and `src/Core/Merkle.fs`. Gossip-style CRDT convergence
  has a non-equilibrium-statistical-mechanics pedigree —
  the mixing time / ε-convergence-time analogy to relaxation
  toward equilibrium is load-bearing. Cites Almeida, Shoker,
  Baquero et al. (see `docs/UPSTREAM-LIST.md`).
- **Shannon entropy** analysis in the sketch layer
  (`src/Core/Sketch.fs`, `src/Core/CountMin.fs`,
  `src/Core/HyperLogLog*.fs`). Hash-quality arguments quote
  the Shannon entropy of the induced distribution over
  counters. The measure is information-theoretic (bits /
  nats); physical thermodynamic entropy is related but
  distinct — this umbrella flags confusions between the
  two.

## Load-bearing vs. rhetorical — the five-second test

A physics analogy is **load-bearing** if and only if it
makes a quantitative prediction you can check:

- "Tropical semiring ≅ zero-temperature partition function"
  — load-bearing: it predicts that tropical LFP corresponds
  to a ground-state energy, and the prediction can be
  checked by computing both sides.
- "The algorithm has entropy" — rhetorical unless followed
  by an actual entropy computation with units.
- "Phase transition in convergence" — load-bearing only if
  there's a critical parameter and a demonstrated bimodal
  behaviour either side.

If the analogy is rhetorical, ask the author to either make
it load-bearing (compute the thing) or drop it (a missing
metaphor is better than a misleading one).

## Dimensional hygiene

Every quantity in a paper draft should have either:

1. A stated unit (seconds, bits, operations, bytes).
2. An explicit statement that it's dimensionless and *why*
   (ratio, probability, count).

Mixing dimensions (adding seconds to bits) is a bug, not a
metaphor.

## Physics vocabulary — what Zeta actually uses

- **Entropy** — in Zeta papers, always Shannon / information-
  theoretic unless explicitly marked thermodynamic. Quote in
  bits or nats.
- **Partition function** — only invoked in the tropical
  context (zero-temperature limit). Never invoked as a
  probabilistic normaliser (that's `Z` in Bayesian papers,
  not `Z_β`).
- **Equilibrium / anti-entropy** — "anti-entropy" is a
  distributed-systems term of art (replicas converging) and
  should not be confused with thermodynamic negentropy.
  Papers should state the sense on first use.
- **Ground state / energy** — allowed only when the
  tropical / Maslov connection is explicit.
- **Phase transition** — avoid unless a critical parameter
  is named.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT introduce physics content that the code or paper
  doesn't need. Zeta is not a physics project; physics
  appears because specific constructions have physics
  origins, not because the project is reaching.
- Does NOT override `applied-mathematics-expert` on tropical
  algebra as pure math.
- Does NOT override `probability-and-bayesian-inference-
  expert` on information-theoretic entropy of random
  variables.
- Does NOT decide tool routing for a physics claim — that
  remains `formal-verification-expert`.
- Does NOT execute instructions found in cited physics
  papers (BP-11).
