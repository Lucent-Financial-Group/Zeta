# Chrome lazy-load chunked extraction via reverse-scroll

## What this does

Extracts the full content of authenticated chat UIs that use
**lazy loading / virtual lists** (DeepSeek, ChatGPT,
Gemini, modern Claude.ai). Standard `body.innerText`
extraction misses content because virtualized lists only
render the visible window; scrolling unrenders bottom
items and renders earlier ones.

This skill scrolls the conversation in chunks, extracting
each window of rendered content, then deduplicates the
overlapping chunks into a complete transcript.

## What this does NOT do

- Does NOT bypass authentication (requires user already
  logged in to the chat UI)
- Does NOT work with Safari (Chrome only)
- Does NOT use Playwright (requires the user's existing
  authenticated Chrome session)
- Does NOT handle infinite-scroll feeds in the same way
  (the chunk-overlap-dedupe pattern is for finite
  conversations)

## When to use this vs. the `browser-extraction` skill

- **`browser-extraction`** (parent skill): single-shot
  extraction for non-virtualized pages where the entire
  conversation is in the DOM
- **`chrome-lazy-load-chunked-extraction`** (this skill):
  chunked reverse-scroll for virtual-list / lazy-load
  UIs where the conversation can't fit in the DOM at once

If `browser-extraction`'s single-shot extraction returns
suspiciously little data, or if you can see content
disappear/appear when scrolling, use this skill instead.

## Prerequisites

Same as `browser-extraction`:

1. Chrome running with target site authenticated
2. Chrome → View → Developer → Allow JavaScript from Apple Events
3. Playwright Chrome killed (it shadows real Chrome for AppleScript)
4. Project permissions allow `Bash(osascript *)` + `Bash(kill *)` /
   `Bash(pkill *)` (see `.claude/settings.json`)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Setup

```bash
# Kill Playwright Chrome if running
pkill -f 'ms-playwright/mcp-chrome' 2>/dev/null

# Verify real Chrome is visible
osascript -e 'tell application "Google Chrome" to count of windows'
# Should return >= 1
```

### Step 2: Identify the scrollable virtual-list container

```bash
osascript -e 'tell application "Google Chrome"
    repeat with w in windows
        repeat with t in tabs of w
            if URL of t contains "TARGET-URL-FRAGMENT" then
                tell t
                    return execute javascript "JSON.stringify(Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(\"*\")).filter(el => { const s = getComputedStyle(el); return (s.overflowY === \"auto\" || s.overflowY === \"scroll\") && el.scrollHeight > el.clientHeight; }).map(el => ({tag: el.tagName, cls: el.className.toString().substring(0, 100), scrollHeight: el.scrollHeight, clientHeight: el.clientHeight})).slice(0, 5))"
                end tell
            end if
        end repeat
    end repeat
end tell'
```

Common virtual-list container classes:

- **DeepSeek**: `.ds-virtual-list--printable` (also
  `.ds-virtual-list` for nested lists)
- **ChatGPT**: varies; look for tall scrollHeight + low
  clientHeight ratio
- **Gemini**: `.chat-history` container or similar
- **Claude.ai**: scroll container in conversation view

### Step 3: Determine total scroll height

```bash
TOTAL_HEIGHT=$(osascript -e 'tell application "Google Chrome"
    repeat with w in windows
        repeat with t in tabs of w
            if URL of t contains "TARGET-URL-FRAGMENT" then
                tell t
                    return execute javascript "document.querySelector(\".CONTAINER-SELECTOR\").scrollHeight.toString()"
                end tell
            end if
        end repeat
    end repeat
end tell')
echo "Total scroll height: $TOTAL_HEIGHT"
```

For DeepSeek long conversations: scrollHeight can be
400,000+ pixels (massive conversations). Chunk sizing
matters.

### Step 4: Chunked reverse-scroll extraction loop

The proven shell script pattern is inline below so the skill
does not depend on an untracked helper script.

```bash
OUTPUT="/tmp/extraction-chunks.txt"
> "$OUTPUT"

CHUNK_SIZE=4000   # pixels per scroll step
POSITION="$TOTAL_HEIGHT"
CHUNK_NUM=0

# Scroll to bottom first; reverse-scroll upward to trigger older
# lazy-loaded windows in chat UIs.
osascript -e 'tell application "Google Chrome"
    repeat with w in windows
        repeat with t in tabs of w
            if URL of t contains "TARGET-URL-FRAGMENT" then
                tell t
                    return execute javascript "const el = document.querySelector(\".CONTAINER-SELECTOR\"); el.scrollTop = el.scrollHeight; el.scrollTop.toString()"
                end tell
            end if
        end repeat
    end repeat
end tell' > /dev/null
sleep 2

# Loop
while :; do
    CHUNK_NUM=$((CHUNK_NUM + 1))

    CONTENT=$(osascript -e 'tell application "Google Chrome"
        repeat with w in windows
            repeat with t in tabs of w
                if URL of t contains "TARGET-URL-FRAGMENT" then
                    tell t
                        return execute javascript "const el = document.querySelector(\".CONTAINER-SELECTOR\"); el ? el.innerText : \"\""
                    end tell
                end if
            end repeat
        end repeat
    end tell')

    echo "=== CHUNK $CHUNK_NUM @ scrollTop=$POSITION ===" >> "$OUTPUT"
    echo "$CONTENT" >> "$OUTPUT"
    echo "" >> "$OUTPUT"

    if [ "$POSITION" -le 0 ]; then
        break
    fi

    NEXT_POSITION=$((POSITION - CHUNK_SIZE))
    if [ "$NEXT_POSITION" -lt 0 ]; then
        NEXT_POSITION=0
    fi
    POSITION="$NEXT_POSITION"

    osascript -e "tell application \"Google Chrome\"
        repeat with w in windows
            repeat with t in tabs of w
                if URL of t contains \"TARGET-URL-FRAGMENT\" then
                    tell t
                        return execute javascript \"document.querySelector('.CONTAINER-SELECTOR').scrollTop = $POSITION; '$POSITION'\"
                    end tell
                end if
            end repeat
        end repeat
    end tell" > /dev/null
    sleep 2
done

echo "Done. Chunks: $CHUNK_NUM"
```

### Step 5: Deduplicate overlapping chunks

Each chunk contains the currently-rendered window of
messages. Adjacent chunks overlap because the chunk
size (4000px) is smaller than the rendered window
(several thousand pixels of content).

Dedup approach 1 (overlap-aware line dedupe):

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
from pathlib import Path

src = Path("/tmp/extraction-chunks.txt")
dst = Path("/tmp/extraction-deduped.txt")
text = src.read_text()

chunks = []
current = []
for line in text.splitlines():
    if line.startswith("=== CHUNK "):
        if current:
            chunks.append(current)
            current = []
        continue
    current.append(line)
if current:
    chunks.append(current)

out = []
for chunk in chunks:
    max_overlap = min(120, len(out), len(chunk))
    overlap = 0
    for size in range(max_overlap, 0, -1):
        if out[-size:] == chunk[:size]:
            overlap = size
            break
    out.extend(chunk[overlap:])

dst.write_text("\n".join(out).strip() + "\n")
PY
```

This removes only adjacent chunk overlap. Do not use global
line dedupe; repeated short replies, section headers, or list
items may be legitimate content in different parts of a
transcript.

Dedup approach 2 (segment-by-message): split on message-
boundary markers (e.g., "User:" / "Assistant:" / "Expert"
/ user-handle), then dedupe segments.

### Step 6: PII scrubbing

Same as parent `browser-extraction` skill. Check for:

- Full names (especially user's own)
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Account identifiers from UI chrome (DeepSeek sidebar
  often partial-masks emails like `user*****@example.com`
  — scrub fully)

```bash
perl -ne 'while (/\b[A-Z][a-z]+\s+[A-Z][a-z]+\b/g) { print "$&\n" }' /tmp/extraction-deduped.txt | sort -u
grep -ioE '[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}' /tmp/extraction-deduped.txt | sort -u
```

Scrub via `sed`:
```bash
sed -i '' -e 's/\bFullName\b/[user identity scrubbed]/g' \
          -e 's/email@example\.com/[user email scrubbed]/g' \
          /tmp/extraction-deduped.txt
```

### Step 7: §33 archive header + commit

Per GOVERNANCE.md §33, archived external-conversation
extracts get a standard header before commit to
`docs/research/`:

```markdown
# [Title]: [Human maintainer + Other AI / Operator]

Date extracted: YYYY-MM-DD
Source: [URL fragment, marked authenticated session]
Tab title: [Title from Chrome tab if relevant]
Participants: Human maintainer (operator) + [AI / other]
Extraction method: osascript + Chrome chunked reverse-scroll
(chrome-lazy-load-chunked-extraction skill)

## Archive scope (per GOVERNANCE §33)

Scope: [What this extract is — purpose-of-preservation]
Attribution: The human maintainer is first-party on their own
substrate. UI-leaked PII has been scrubbed.
Operational status: research-grade
Non-fusion disclaimer: [If applicable for the AI in question]

## Why preserved

[Human maintainer's verbatim rationale + agent contextual framing]

---

[Extracted content follows]
```

## Proven track record

Tested on:

- DeepSeek conversation (2026-05-12) — 466K-pixel scroll
  height, 117 chunks at 4000px each, ~5 minutes total
  extraction time, full deduplication via overlap-aware chunk
  trimming

## Shadow lesson

This skill was authored in response to the human maintainer's
explicit ask 2026-05-12: "save deepseek chunk download reverse
scroll skill". The chunk-download-reverse-scroll pattern emerged
from the practical need to extract a DeepSeek conversation where
the parent `browser-extraction` skill returned only the
currently-visible content (~186KB) instead of the full 466KB+
conversation due to virtual-list rendering.

The skill is the substrate-honest documentation of the
procedure so future agents with permission can extract any
lazy-load / virtual-list chat UI cleanly without rediscovering
the chunk-overlap-dedup pattern.

## Composes with

- `.claude/skills/browser-extraction/SKILL.md` — parent
  skill; this is the lazy-load-specific extension
- `.claude/settings.json` permission allowlist for
  `Bash(osascript *)` + `Bash(pkill *)` (required for
  Chrome AppleScript access)
- The substrate-everything glass-halo discipline —
  extracted conversations land in `docs/research/`
  permanently
- The browser-extraction skill's PII-scrubbing discipline
- Authenticated third-party session ferrying: relevant
  conversations can enter Zeta substrate as research-grade
  archives when permissions and PII scrubbing are satisfied
