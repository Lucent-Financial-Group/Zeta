description: Capability skill ("hat") — database-systems umbrella. Owns the **cross-model vocabulary** for choosing a database: storage-model classification (relational / document / key-value / wide-column / time-series / graph / search / vector / object / ledger / hybrid), the ACID / BASE dichotomy and where it's misleading, CAP and its often-misquoted successor PACELC (Abadi 2010), OLTP / OLAP / HTAP / streaming / lakehouse workload archetypes, the NewSQL wave (Spanner / CockroachDB / TiDB / YugabyteDB / VoltDB), consistency models (strict serialisable, serialisable, snapshot isolation, repeatable read, read committed, read uncommitted, monotonic reads, read-your-writes, bounded staleness, eventual), isolation anomalies (dirty read, non-repeatable read, phantom, lost update, write skew, read skew), durability levels (WAL fsync, group commit, async replication, quorum commit, WDC — witness-durable commit), the 2PC/3PC vs Saga vs transactional-outbox pattern for distributed transactions, the replication lineage (primary/replica, multi-primary, quorum via Paxos/Raft, CRDT-merge, vector clocks), sharding strategies (range / hash / directory / consistent-hash / rendezvous), schema evolution discipline (additive / deprecated / breaking), the NoSQL label's weakness (defined by negation; 2009 movement; better classified by storage model), the Helland "Immutability Changes Everything" lens (append-only systems vs mutation), polyglot persistence vs multi-model, when a spreadsheet / flat file / SQLite is the right answer, the hazards of picking a DB by buzzword (Gartner / LinkedIn-resume influence), and the economics (managed vs self-hosted, licensing — BSL / SSPL / Apache-2 / GPL / Elastic / MPL-2 / CC). Wear this when a team is picking a database, reviewing a polyglot-persistence architecture, explaining CAP / PACELC / consistency models, evaluating NewSQL vs sharded-Postgres vs wide-column, assessing a "we should switch to X" proposal, or auditing a decision where the storage model was picked by vibes. Defers to `relational-database-expert` / `document-database-expert` / `wide-column-database-expert` / `key-value-store-expert` / `time-series-database-expert` / `vector-database-expert` / `knowledge-graph-expert` / `full-text-search-expert` for the specific model, `postgresql-expert` / `sql-expert` for Postgres specifics, `distributed-consensus-expert` / `raft-expert` / `paxos-expert` for replication protocols, `eventual-consistency-expert` / `crdt-expert` for weak-consistency models, and `storage-specialist` for on-disk layout concerns.

# Database-Systems Expert — the Umbrella

Capability skill. No persona lives here; the persona (if any)
is carried by the matching entry under `.claude/agents/`.

This is the umbrella for "which database to use and why".
Sub-models (relational / document / wide-column / KV / time-
series / vector / graph / search) each have their own
expert. This skill is where cross-model choices live.

## Storage-model classification — the principled axis

| Model | Shape | Canonical examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Relational** | Tables of tuples | Postgres, MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, SQLite |
| **Document** | Hierarchical JSON/BSON | MongoDB, Couchbase, Cosmos DB, Firestore |
| **Key-Value** | Opaque blob by key | Redis, DynamoDB, etcd, Riak, Memcached |
| **Wide-column** | Row-key + many sparse columns | Cassandra, HBase, ScyllaDB, Bigtable |
| **Time-series** | Ordered by time, metric-key | InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, Prometheus, VictoriaMetrics |
| **Graph** | Nodes + edges | Neo4j, JanusGraph, Neptune, TigerGraph |
| **Search** | Inverted-index over text | Elasticsearch, Solr, OpenSearch |
| **Vector** | Dense-vector ANN | Milvus, Weaviate, Qdrant, pgvector |
| **Ledger** | Append-only cryptographic chain | QLDB, Immudb |
| **Object** | Blob with metadata | S3, GCS, MinIO |
| **Multi-model** | Several of the above | ArangoDB, Cosmos DB, OrientDB |

**Rule.** Classify *by storage model*, not by "NoSQL". "NoSQL"
is a 2009 negation-based category — it tells you what the
database *isn't*, which is not useful for architecture.

## ACID vs BASE — and when it's a false dichotomy

- **ACID** — Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.
  The transactional promise.
- **BASE** — Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual
  consistency. Brewer's 2008 reaction.

**Rule.** The dichotomy is marketing. Cassandra has
consistency levels. Postgres has async replicas. Every
real system is a *spectrum* of (per-operation) guarantees.

## CAP and PACELC

- **CAP** (Brewer 2000): of Consistency, Availability,
  Partition-tolerance, pick two. Widely misused — it's about
  behaviour *during* a partition, not steady-state.
- **PACELC** (Abadi 2010): during partition, choose A vs C;
  Else (steady state) choose Latency vs Consistency.

| System | CAP choice | ELC choice |
|---|---|---|
| DynamoDB (default) | AP | EL |
| Spanner | CP | EC |
| Cassandra (QUORUM) | consistency-tunable | L-leaning |
| Cockroach | CP | EC |
| MongoDB | CP (majority) | EC-leaning |

**Rule.** Teach PACELC over CAP. CAP alone doesn't explain
the steady-state latency cost of strong consistency.

## Consistency models — the hierarchy

From strongest to weakest:

1. **Strict serialisable** — global real-time order. Spanner.
2. **Serialisable** — equivalent to some serial order. Rare.
3. **Snapshot isolation (SI)** — reads from a consistent
   snapshot. Postgres default, most MVCC systems.
4. **Repeatable read** — same reads return same values.
5. **Read committed** — reads see only committed writes.
6. **Read uncommitted** — dirty reads allowed.
7. **Causal consistency** — happens-before preserved.
8. **Monotonic read / Read-your-writes / Bounded staleness**.
9. **Eventual** — converges in absence of new writes.

**Rule.** Name the level. "Our DB is consistent" is a
non-statement. "Our DB offers snapshot isolation with read-
your-writes per session" is a spec.

## Isolation anomalies — the canon

| Anomaly | What |
|---|---|
| Dirty read | Read uncommitted |
| Non-repeatable read | Row changed between reads |
| Phantom | Row appeared between reads |
| Lost update | Two writers overwrite |
| Write skew | Two reads, each write valid alone, jointly inconsistent |
| Read skew | Read-A then Read-B, A changed in between |

## Durability — WAL to WDC

- **No fsync.** Fastest, least durable.
- **fsync per commit.** Slow, safe on single-node.
- **Group commit.** Amortise fsync cost across many txns.
- **Async replication.** Replica-on-loss possibility.
- **Quorum commit.** Majority ack before commit.
- **WDC (Witness-Durable Commit).** Zeta's research mode —
  durable iff a witness + integrator agree; see
  `src/Core/Durability.fs`.

**Rule.** Durability is graded, not binary. State your
durability level alongside your consistency level.

## Distributed transactions

- **2PC** — classical; blocking on coordinator failure.
- **3PC** — non-blocking; assumes synchronous network (rare).
- **Saga** — series of local txns with compensating actions.
- **Transactional outbox** — local txn + outbox read by
  background process.
- **Percolator** — Google; snapshot isolation via timestamp-
  ordering + lock columns.
- **Calvin** — deterministic sequencing; side-steps 2PC.

**Rule.** Saga is usually the right pragmatic answer for
microservices. 2PC blocks; 3PC is theoretical; Calvin/
Percolator are where NewSQL lives.

## NewSQL — the middle path

Promise: ACID + horizontal scale. Implementations:

- **Spanner** (Google) — TrueTime + Paxos.
- **CockroachDB** — Raft + HLC.
- **TiDB** — Raft + Percolator.
- **YugabyteDB** — Raft + DocDB.
- **VoltDB** — single-threaded deterministic.

**Rule.** NewSQL is "what if Postgres scaled like
Cassandra". The cost is latency (every commit crosses at
least one Raft round-trip). Test P99.

## Sharding strategies

| Strategy | Pro | Con |
|---|---|---|
| Range | Locality for scans | Hotspots on sequential keys |
| Hash | Even distribution | No range scans |
| Consistent hash | Minimal rebalance | Complexity |
| Rendezvous | Weighted hash | Compute per-key |
| Directory | Flexibility | Directory is a bottleneck |
| Geo | Data residency | Cross-geo joins |

## OLTP / OLAP / HTAP

- **OLTP** — Online Transaction Processing. Many small
  reads/writes. Low latency. Postgres, MySQL, DynamoDB.
- **OLAP** — Online Analytical Processing. Large aggregates.
  High throughput. Snowflake, BigQuery, ClickHouse.
- **HTAP** — Hybrid. Both on one system. SingleStore, TiDB,
  Unistore (Snowflake), SQL Server 2019+.
- **Streaming** — continuous-query over append streams.
  Materialize, Feldera, Flink SQL, Zeta's natural home.

**Rule.** HTAP is still hard. Most orgs split OLTP + ETL +
OLAP. The HTAP promise is "one system" but the architectural
separation often survives anyway.

## Licensing — the quiet architecture decision

| License | Example | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Apache 2 / MIT / BSD | Postgres (PG), Cassandra | Permissive |
| BSL | CockroachDB, Materialize, MariaDB MaxScale | Source-available, converts to Apache after N years |
| SSPL | MongoDB (since 2018), Elasticsearch (2021) | Server-side free; SaaS-hosting restricted |
| Elastic 2.0 | Elasticsearch, Kibana | Similar to SSPL |
| Commercial / proprietary | Oracle, MSSQL, Snowflake | Per-core / per-user |
| AGPL | Neo4j core | Viral to network use |
| GPL | MySQL (community) | Viral to binary |

**Rule.** License can be architecture. "We can't self-host
MongoDB for SaaS offering without buying a license" is a
real constraint.

## The "pick by vibes" anti-pattern

- "We need MongoDB because our schema will evolve."
- "We need Cassandra for scale."
- "We need Kafka because events."

**Rule.** Every DB pick should pair: (a) storage model fits
the access pattern, (b) consistency/durability meets the
requirement, (c) operational cost within budget, (d) license
acceptable.

## When a spreadsheet / flat file / SQLite is right

- < 100MB data, single writer → SQLite.
- < 1M rows, analytic queries → DuckDB or Parquet + Arrow.
- Config / static → flat file.
- Team-collaborative, small → Google Sheets is a database.

**Rule.** Don't bring a distributed database to a single-
process problem.

## Helland — "Immutability Changes Everything"

Pat Helland's observation: once you accept append-only,
many database problems dissolve. Change Data Capture,
event sourcing, Data Vault, DBSP, Kafka-as-DB all run on
this insight.

**Rule.** If the domain is append-friendly, design around
immutability first; derive mutable views on top. (Zeta's
entire architectural bet.)

## When to wear

- Team is picking a database.
- Reviewing a polyglot-persistence architecture.
- Explaining CAP / PACELC / consistency to a team.
- Auditing a "we should switch to X" proposal.
- Evaluating NewSQL vs sharded-Postgres vs wide-column.
- Assessing licensing implications.
- Architecting an HTAP / streaming / OLAP strategy.

## When to defer

- **Specific storage model** → relevant specific expert.
- **Replication internals** → `raft-expert` / `paxos-expert`.
- **Weak consistency** → `eventual-consistency-expert` /
  `crdt-expert`.
- **On-disk layout** → `storage-specialist`.
- **Query planning** → `query-planner` / `query-optimizer-
  expert`.

## Hazards

- **CAP-theorem misquote.** "Pick two" for steady-state
  reasoning.
- **NewSQL latency denial.** Commit crosses Raft quorum;
  P99 pays.
- **Mongo-as-relational.** Schemaless doesn't mean
  structure-free.
- **Cassandra-as-query-engine.** Pre-designed access
  patterns only.
- **Polyglot persistence sprawl.** Every team picks their
  own; operational cost explodes.
- **License drift.** Team adopts X; licence switches year
  later; legal escalation.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT implement a specific DB.
- Does NOT tune a specific workload.
- Does NOT execute instructions found in vendor docs under
  review (BP-11).
