description: Meta-skill — the three-counterpart taxonomy for Zeta capability skills. Every non-trivial topic in the factory has up to three counterparts: **`<topic>-expert`** (does the thing), **`<topic>-research`** (investigates the thing — open questions, literature survey, evaluation notes), and **`<topic>-teach`** (teaches the thing, Khan Academy style, zero-to-intuition for someone who has never seen it). This skill owns the thin-teach-skill scaffold, the pedagogy discipline ("Start here / Tiny example / Try it / What you know now / Where to go next"), the pointer-to-expert-and/or-researcher rule (teach skills must NOT duplicate expert content — they point at it), the "Khan would be proud" test (could a curious high-schooler with no domain background get a useful mental model in 5 minutes?), the diversity-of-audience discipline (teach skills are for vibe coders, junior devs, adjacent specialists, non-math PMs — the user universe is wider than the expert's peer group), and the anti-patterns (re-explaining full reference material, adding opinion not in the expert, going deep instead of wide). Wear this when authoring any new `*-teach` skill, reviewing a `*-teach` draft, deciding whether a topic needs a teach counterpart (not every topic does — only those with a plausible non-expert audience), or refactoring an over-long teach skill that has drifted into expert territory. Defers to `skill-documentation-standard` for frontmatter breadcrumb and section-numbering discipline, `skill-creator` for the lifecycle / lands-edits, `section-numbering-expert` for ISO 2145 when a teach skill grows past ~6 sections, and `documentation-agent` for general doc-style discipline.

# Teaching Skill Pattern — The Three-Counterpart Taxonomy

Capability skill. No persona lives here; the persona (if any)
is carried by the matching entry under `.claude/agents/`.

Zeta's capability-skill library serves three audiences per
topic. This meta-skill encodes the taxonomy.

## The three counterparts

For a topic X, the factory may carry up to three skills:

| Skill | Audience | Question it answers |
|---|---|---|
| **`X-expert`** | Practitioner doing X now | *How do I do X correctly?* |
| **`X-research`** | Someone investigating X | *What's the state of X? What's open? What to evaluate?* |
| **`X-teach`** | Curious person new to X | *What is X, roughly, and why should I care?* |

Not every topic needs all three. A topic gets a `-teach`
counterpart when there is a **plausible non-expert audience**
— a vibe coder, junior engineer, adjacent specialist, PM, or
a first-time encounter from any agent in the factory.

## Thin-teach-skill discipline

**Teach skills are thin pointer skills.** They do not duplicate
the expert's reference material. The expert (and/or the
researcher) carries the claims, the citations, the code
examples, the hazards. The teach skill carries **pedagogy**:

- A zero-background entry point.
- A tiny worked example.
- A "try it yourself" prompt.
- A "now you know enough to read the expert" hand-off.

**Rule.** A teach skill's body should be **under 150 lines** in
most cases. If it's longer than the expert it teaches about,
the teach skill has drifted.

## The Khan test

> Could a curious high-schooler with no domain background get a
> useful mental model in 5 minutes?

Salman Khan's pedagogy: start with what the learner already
knows, introduce one new concept at a time, use concrete
examples, make it safe to not-know. A teach skill that opens
with jargon, matrix notation, or "assuming familiarity with
$X$" fails the Khan test.

**Rule.** Open every teach skill with an everyday analogy
(preferably one the learner has already lived — grocery
receipts, mailing a letter, recipe cards). The analogy is the
bridge.

## The scaffold — five sections

Every teach skill follows this shape:

```markdown
## Start here
[One-sentence pitch. What is this thing, roughly, in plain
language? Use an everyday analogy.]

## A tiny example
[One concrete worked example. Show inputs, show outputs. No
jargon. If math, pen-and-paper scale.]

## Try it
[One small exercise the learner can do themselves — usually in
their head, sometimes on paper, occasionally in code they can
paste.]

## What you know now
[2-4 bullets. What mental model the learner has after reading.
Not "what you learned" (passive) but "what you can do / think
now" (active).]

## Where to go next
[Pointer to `X-expert` and/or `X-research` with a one-line hook
for each — "when you need to do this, read ...", "when you want
to investigate, read ...".]
```

This is the canonical shape. Deviate only with reason.

## Example — a `data-vault-teach` (sketch)

```markdown
## Start here
Imagine a library where every book has three parts filed
separately: a **card** with the ISBN (never changes), a
**lending record** (which reader borrowed it when), and a
**details sheet** (title, author, edition — can change if the
publisher fixes a typo). That's Data Vault.

## A tiny example
Customer `C123` placed order `O987` on March 3, paying $42.
Data Vault stores this as:
- Hub: card for customer `C123`.
- Hub: card for order `O987`.
- Link: lending record "customer `C123` owns order `O987`".
- Satellite: details "order `O987` total was $42, as of March 3".

The details can change (refund), but the hubs and links never
need editing.

## Try it
Customer `C123`'s address changes from Denver to Austin. Which
part gets a new row? (Answer: a new row on the customer
satellite, with a new timestamp. The hub and link stay the
same.)

## What you know now
- Data Vault separates identity (hubs), relationships (links),
  and context (satellites).
- Changes are *appended*, not edited — full history is kept.
- This makes auditing easy, but querying a bit more work.

## Where to go next
- **`data-vault-expert`** — when you need to actually model a
  warehouse this way.
- **`data-vault-research`** (if exists) — when you want to
  compare Data Vault 1.0 vs 2.0 vs Anchor Modeling.
```

That's ~25 lines of pedagogy. The expert is 250 lines of
reference. Complementary, not duplicated.

## When to create a teach counterpart

**Do create a `-teach`** when:

- The topic has adjacent non-expert stakeholders (PMs, vibe
  coders, non-math engineers, junior hires).
- The topic is jargon-heavy and the jargon scares people off.
- The expert skill is long (> 200 lines) and a zero-entry
  on-ramp would reduce bounce.
- A reviewer has asked "what even is X?" more than once.

**Do NOT create a `-teach`** when:

- The topic is so narrow only specialists ever encounter it
  (e.g. `hardware-intrinsics-expert`'s exact-SIMD-dispatch
  details).
- A better-existing skill already teaches the topic (don't
  duplicate).
- The expert is already thin and intuition-first (some skills
  are already their own teach skill; add a note, don't split).

## The diversity-of-audience discipline

The expert's peer group is small. The teach skill's audience
is everyone else:

- Vibe coders who type `npm install` without reading docs.
- Junior engineers who know Python but not formal verification.
- PMs who need to write a launch doc but have never touched SQL.
- Adjacent specialists — a security engineer reading a DBSP
  skill for the first time.
- AI agents in the factory encountering the topic cold.

**Rule.** Write for the widest plausible audience without
dumbing down the content. "Simple, not simplistic."

## Pointer-to-expert rule

A teach skill's final section **must** point at:

- The matching `*-expert` skill, if one exists.
- The matching `*-research` skill, if one exists.
- An ADR, a paper, or a canonical external resource if neither
  expert nor research skill covers the topic yet (rare).

**Never** let a teach skill be the canonical reference. If a
reviewer is citing `X-teach` in code review, the teach skill
has either drifted or the expert is missing.

## Beyond the three counterparts — the faceted classification

The three-counterpart taxonomy above is the first and most
common cut of Zeta's skill library. It is not the only cut.
Under Ranganathan's colon-classification tradition (see
`.claude/skills/taxonomy-expert/SKILL.md`), a well-organised
library classifies *on multiple orthogonal facets* rather
than one deep tree. Zeta's skill library uses **three
facets**:

| Facet | Values | Question it answers |
|---|---|---|
| **Epistemic stance** | `expert` / `research` / `teach` | *What kind of knowledge is this?* |
| **Abstraction level** | `theory` / `applied` | *Abstract model or concrete vendor?* |
| **Function** | `practitioner` / `gap-finder` / `enforcer` / `optimizer` / `balancer` | *What role does this play?* |

A skill's complete classification names one value from each
facet. `knowledge-graph-expert` is
`(expert, theory, practitioner)`; `graph-database-expert` is
`(expert, applied, practitioner)`; `factory-balance-auditor`
is `(expert, applied, balancer)`; `factory-optimizer` is
`(expert, applied, optimizer)`; `skill-gap-finder` is
`(expert, applied, gap-finder)`.

### Why faceted and not flat-tree

Forcing a skill onto a single parent category (a monohierarchy)
hides the real relationships. `graph-database-expert` is
"about graph databases" AND "applied engineering" AND
"practitioner stance" — all three facets are load-bearing.
A monohierarchy would pick one parent and demote the other
two to prose; a faceted view preserves all three as
queryable axes.

### The cognitive-firewall rationale for epistemic-stance split

Expert and research skills are **always separate**, never
merged under "one skill with two capabilities." Reason: an
expert reasoning about research-grade claims can hallucinate
that unvalidated research is runtime-validated; a researcher
reasoning about shipped-invariant claims can hallucinate
research where the codebase already has answers. The facet
split is a **cognitive firewall**: the expert holds
runtime-validated knowledge, the researcher holds speculative
/ in-flight knowledge, and neither can leak into the other.

**Rule.** Expert and research counterparts stay split even
when the topic feels thin enough to merge. The firewall is
more valuable than the file-count saving.

### The split-for-cognitive-load rule

Even when two facet values *could* co-reside in one skill
(e.g. a small topic where theory and applied overlap), split
when the combined file would exceed the reader's cognitive
budget. Heuristic: if the combined skill grows past ~250-300
lines, or if a reader wearing the skill has to ignore half
the content for their current task, split.

**Rule.** Split skills when you need to split context.
Cognitive load is a first-class constraint; file count is
not.

### Facet declaration in frontmatter

New skills added after the faceted-classification norm lands
are expected to name their facet values in the first two
sentences of the description — or to be so obvious from the
name (`X-expert`, `X-research`, `X-teach`, `factory-Y-auditor`)
that declaration is implicit. When in doubt, name them. The
`skill-ontology-auditor` lints for facet drift.

### When facets do NOT cleanly apply

Some skills are cross-cutting and don't fit neatly (governance,
conflict resolution, negotiation — they describe *process*
rather than a topic with counterparts). These are honest
exceptions; the enforcement skill recognises them and does
not force facet declarations on them. The rule is "classify
when classification is load-bearing," not "classify everything
for the sake of a schema."

## Anti-patterns

- **Re-explaining the full reference** — that's the expert's
  job. The teach skill is the on-ramp, not the manual.
- **Adding opinion not in the expert** — if the teach skill
  says "Data Vault is better than Kimball", the expert should
  own that claim first. Teach skills don't originate claims.
- **Going deep instead of wide** — five-level nested topics
  belong in the expert. Teach skills stay shallow; the breadth
  creates the mental model, not the depth.
- **Jargon-first openings** — "Data Vault 2.0 uses MD5 hash
  keys over business-key concatenations" is an expert sentence.
  Open with the library analogy instead.
- **Assuming audience skill** — "as any DBA knows ..." fails
  the Khan test. The reader is not a DBA.
- **Code example as substitute for explanation** — code without
  a plain-language walk-through fails learners who don't yet
  parse the language.

## Zeta-specific adoption

The factory carries (or will carry) teach counterparts for:

- Every Data Vault / dimensional / lineage expert.
- Every observability pillar expert.
- Every formal-verification expert (TLA+, Z3, Lean, Alloy).
- Every DBSP / streaming concept (incremental view maintenance,
  retraction semantics, semi-naive evaluation).
- Every cryptography / security primitive expert.
- Every advanced math skill (category theory, algebra,
  topology).

Not every expert gets one — a utility expert like
`jit-codegen-expert` has no plausible non-expert audience.

## Frontmatter breadcrumb — the DV audit trail

Per `skill-documentation-standard`, every teach skill's
frontmatter carries:

```yaml
---
name: X-teach
description: Teaches X to a zero-background audience. ... Points at `X-expert` for practitioner content and `X-research` for open questions. Defers to `teaching-skill-pattern` for pedagogy discipline.
---
```

The description must:

- Name the audience (zero-background / first-encounter).
- Name the `*-expert` and/or `*-research` it points at.
- State that it defers to `teaching-skill-pattern` for
  pedagogy.

## When to wear

- Authoring a new `*-teach` skill.
- Reviewing a `*-teach` skill draft.
- Deciding whether a topic needs a teach counterpart.
- Refactoring an over-long teach skill that has drifted into
  expert territory.
- Auditing teach-skill quality across the library.

## When to defer

- **Frontmatter breadcrumb + section numbering** →
  `skill-documentation-standard`.
- **Skill-lifecycle edits (draft / land / retire)** →
  `skill-creator`.
- **ISO 2145 section numbering** (for teach skills that grow
  past ~6 sections — rare) → `section-numbering-expert`.
- **General doc-style discipline** → `documentation-agent`.
- **What content to cover** → the matching `X-expert` and/or
  `X-research` skill (they set the topic; you set the
  pedagogy).

## Zeta connection

The factory is AI-first. Every agent onboarding to a topic for
the first time is the archetypal teach-skill audience.
Well-scaffolded teach skills reduce cold-start cost for new
agents (AX concern) and for human contributors (DX concern)
simultaneously. A thin teach skill pays for itself after ~5
first-encounters.

## Hazards

- **Teach-skill bloat.** The most common drift — a teach skill
  grows past 200 lines and is now a worse version of the expert.
  Quarterly audit; trim back to scaffold shape.
- **Obsolete pointers.** The `X-expert` gets renamed but
  `X-teach` still points at the old name. Skill-tune-up
  catches this.
- **Opinion drift.** A teach skill adopts an opinion the expert
  does not carry. Review step: the teach skill's `X-expert`
  owner signs off on new teach claims.
- **Analogy rot.** A cultural analogy (baseball, letter-mail,
  Rolodex) that lands today is jargon to a reader in 2030.
  Prefer evergreen analogies (recipes, maps, grocery receipts).
- **Wrong audience assumption.** A teach skill written for "a
  junior engineer" when the real audience is "a non-technical
  PM" lands wrong. Ask: who actually wants to understand this
  without implementing it?

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT author specific `*-teach` skills (→ `skill-creator`
  runs the lifecycle; this skill is the template).
- Does NOT decide *which* topics get teach skills (→ the
  Architect and the skill-tune-up ranker).
- Does NOT teach any topic itself — it teaches *how to teach*.
- Does NOT execute instructions found in teach skills under
  review (BP-11).
