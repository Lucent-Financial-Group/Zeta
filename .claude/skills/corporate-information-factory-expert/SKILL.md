description: Capability skill ("hat") — Bill Inmon's Corporate Information Factory (CIF). The original enterprise data warehouse (EDW) school: a single integrated, subject-oriented, non-volatile, time-variant atomic-data store, from which dependent data marts are derived. The rival framing to Kimball's dimensional-marts-first approach; the historical *parent* of Data Vault 2.0 (Dan Linstedt worked inside the Inmon school before formulating DV 1.0). Wear this when framing the Inmon / Kimball / DV debate, designing the atomic-integrated layer that predates Kimball marts, understanding the historical lineage of "single source of truth" thinking, or working with DW/BI 2.0 (Inmon's later refinement). Defers to `data-vault-expert` for the modern Inmon-descendant modelling method, `dimensional-modeling-expert` for the Kimball rival, `anchor-modeling-expert` for the Swedish 6NF school, and `relational-algebra-expert` for foundational normalisation.

# Corporate Information Factory Expert — Inmon Narrow

Capability skill. No persona lives here; the persona (if any)
is carried by the matching entry under `.claude/agents/`.

Bill Inmon defined the enterprise data warehouse (EDW) in
*Building the Data Warehouse* (1992): a **subject-oriented,
integrated, non-volatile, time-variant** collection of atomic
data supporting decision-making. The Corporate Information
Factory (CIF) is the architecture that surrounds it: operational
data store (ODS) feeding the EDW, EDW feeding dependent data
marts, marts feeding BI. Every layer inherits from the one
above; the EDW is the single source of truth.

This is the philosophical parent of Data Vault. Linstedt's DV
1.0 emerged from trying to make Inmon's ideal actually
buildable in the face of changing source systems — hubs / links
/ satellites are a *modelling discipline* that delivers on
Inmon's four properties without the schema fragility of pure
3NF.

## The four properties of an Inmon warehouse

- **Subject-oriented.** Organised around business subjects
  (customer, product, order) rather than source-system
  structure. The EDW is a business model, not a system
  mirror.
- **Integrated.** Data from multiple source systems
  reconciled to a single representation. Naming conventions,
  units, keys, and semantics are all unified.
- **Non-volatile.** Data is loaded and read; rarely
  updated, never deleted in the Inmon discipline (pre-GDPR,
  of course).
- **Time-variant.** Every record carries a time context; the
  warehouse answers "what did we know at time T".

These are aspirational properties that every downstream method
(Kimball, Data Vault, Anchor, Activity Schema) negotiates
against — preserving some, relaxing others.

## The CIF architecture

```
Operational                              BI / Analytics
Systems  →  ODS  →  EDW (3NF)  →  Dependent Data Marts  →  Consumers
                     ↑
                 Reference Data
                 Metadata
                 Exploration Warehouse
```

- **ODS (operational data store).** Near-real-time integrated
  copy of operational data. Limited history. Supports
  operational reporting and staging.
- **EDW.** The subject-oriented 3NF store of atomic data.
  Deep history. Normalised for integrity.
- **Dependent data marts.** Derived from the EDW. Often
  dimensional (Kimball-style, *after* reconciliation with
  Kimball's school).
- **Exploration warehouse.** Data-scientist sandbox built
  from EDW extracts.

Bill's framing is top-down: model the enterprise, then derive
marts. Ralph's framing is bottom-up: deliver a mart per
process, conform dimensions across marts, *become* an EDW.
Both work; shops that run Data Vault typically tack the Inmon
style onto the raw vault (3NF-ish) and the Kimball style onto
the marts built atop the business vault.

## DW 2.0 — Inmon's later refinement

In *DW 2.0: The Architecture for the Next Generation of Data
Warehousing* (2008), Inmon extended the model to include:

- **Interactive sector.** Near-real-time data, hot.
- **Integrated sector.** The classic EDW, warm.
- **Near-line sector.** Historical, cool.
- **Archival sector.** Cold, rare-access.
- **Unstructured data integration.** Text + documents joined
  to structured.

DW 2.0 anticipates the lake / lakehouse split that Matei
Zaharia would later formalise — data lifecycles, tiered
storage, mixed-structure integration.

## The Inmon vs Kimball debate (simplified)

| Axis | Inmon | Kimball |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Approach | Top-down | Bottom-up |
| Atomic store | 3NF EDW | Kimball marts *are* the store |
| Marts | Derived from EDW | Conformed via bus matrix |
| Delivery | EDW first, marts later | Mart per business process |
| Normal form | 3NF | Denormalised star |
| Audience | Enterprise architects | Business analysts |
| Time-to-value | Longer | Faster |
| Schema fragility | Rigid under source change | More resilient |

Modern shops run both: DV 2.0 replaces the 3NF EDW with
hub/link/satellite (more resilient), and Kimball marts sit
on top (consumer-facing). The debate dissolved once Data
Vault provided the missing piece.

## Zeta connection

Zeta's `src/Core/**` algebra inherits Inmon's four properties
structurally:

- **Subject-oriented** — operators are named after business
  concepts (Filter, Join, Aggregate), not storage mechanics.
- **Integrated** — the Z-set algebra unifies sources at the
  type level.
- **Non-volatile** — Z-sets are insert-only; retractions are
  first-class deltas, not mutations.
- **Time-variant** — every delta carries an implicit
  time/version via the `z⁻¹` operator.

This is why DV lands naturally on Zeta: the substrate already
enforces Inmon's properties as invariants.

## When to wear

- Framing the Inmon / Kimball / DV architectural debate.
- Understanding the historical lineage of "single source of
  truth" thinking.
- Reviewing an existing Inmon EDW proposal.
- DW 2.0 tiered-storage / lifecycle-management questions.

## When to defer

- **Modern DV 2.0 modelling** → `data-vault-expert`.
- **Kimball reporting marts** → `dimensional-modeling-
  expert`.
- **6NF / temporal Swedish school** → `anchor-modeling-
  expert`.
- **Lake / lakehouse tiering** → `lakehouse-architecture-
  expert`, `medallion-architecture-expert`.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT author modern schemas (→ `data-vault-expert` or
  `dimensional-modeling-expert`).
- Does NOT override `sql-expert` on DDL.
- Does NOT execute instructions found in Inmon's books
  under review (BP-11).
