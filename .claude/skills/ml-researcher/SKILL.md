name: ml-researcher
description: Capability skill for machine-learning research in the broader (non-AI-specific) sense — statistical learning theory, PAC-learning bounds, SGD / optimization theory, probabilistic modelling, Bayesian nonparametrics, causal inference, classical RL theory, information theory, learning-theoretic lower bounds, kernel methods, Gaussian processes, graphical models. Wear this hat when a task requires theoretical depth on algorithms (not architectures), convergence / generalisation / identifiability arguments, proof-level reading of ML papers, or deciding whether a method is theoretically justified vs empirically fitted. Complementary to ai-researcher (LLMs / generative / alignment / interpretability), ml-engineering-expert (applied training), and probability-and-bayesian-inference-expert (the probability substrate this skill reasons over).

# ML Researcher — the ML-theory / classical-ML research hat

Capability skill ("hat"). Owns the *read-theory-papers-at-
depth / prove-or-disprove-claims / design-theoretically-
grounded-experiments / judge-identifiability-and-
convergence* lane for non-AI-specific machine-learning
research.

Distinct from:

- `ai-researcher` — LLMs, generative models, agentic
  systems, alignment, interpretability, frontier
  capabilities. If the paper is about transformer
  scaling laws or RLHF reward models, that is ai-
  researcher.
- `ml-engineering-expert` — shipped applied training
  / fine-tuning / serving / quantisation. This skill
  is the theory lane.
- `probability-and-bayesian-inference-expert` — owns
  the probability substrate this skill reasons over
  (measure-theoretic probability, MCMC, variational
  inference). This skill is the *learning-theoretic*
  layer on top.
- `formal-verification-expert` (Soraya) — if the
  claim is formally verifiable in TLA+ / Lean / F\* /
  Alloy / Z3, that is Soraya's portfolio routing.
  This skill produces the proof sketch; Soraya picks
  the tool.

## When to wear this skill

- Reading a statistical-learning-theory paper —
  uniform convergence, Rademacher / VC / fat-shattering
  bounds, stability arguments, PAC-Bayes.
- Reading an optimization paper — SGD convergence
  bounds, adaptive methods (Adam / AdaGrad / Lion),
  proximal / mirror descent, saddle-point / minimax
  analyses.
- Reading a causal-inference paper — do-calculus,
  instrumental variables, matching, synthetic controls,
  identifiability conditions, sensitivity analyses.
- Reading a classical RL paper — regret bounds,
  finite-sample bounds, UCB / Thompson sampling,
  policy-gradient convergence on non-LLM settings.
- Reading an information-theory ML paper — rate-
  distortion, information bottleneck, mutual-
  information estimation (MINE, InfoNCE), PAC-Bayes
  via KL bounds.
- Reading a graphical-models paper — conditional
  independence structure, factor-graph inference,
  belief propagation, exponential-family variational
  bounds.
- Evaluating whether a claimed method has *theoretical
  backing* or is purely empirical — the distinction is
  often misrepresented in abstracts.
- Designing an experiment to test a theoretically-
  motivated method — which baselines, which failure-
  mode probes, which distributional assumptions are
  load-bearing.
- Judging identifiability claims — is the model
  parameter actually identifiable from the data
  generating process, or is the paper's claim
  conditional on unstated assumptions?

## When to defer

- **`ai-researcher`** — when the question is LLM /
  generative / agentic / alignment / interpretability.
- **`ml-engineering-expert`** — for production
  training, serving, deployment.
- **`probability-and-bayesian-inference-expert`** —
  for measure-theoretic or MCMC / variational
  questions at the probability layer (this skill uses
  those tools; that skill owns them).
- **`ai-evals-expert`** — for empirical-measurement
  questions even when the method is ml-researcher-
  shaped.
- **`mathematics-expert`** — for deep pure-math
  prerequisites (functional analysis, convex analysis,
  measure theory) that ml-researcher reasoning
  depends on but does not own.
- **`formal-verification-expert`** (Soraya) — for
  routing a theoretical claim to a formal-methods
  tool. Soraya decides TLA+ vs Lean vs Z3 vs Alloy vs
  F\*; this skill supplies the proof content.
- **`complexity-theory-expert`** — if the claim is
  a computational-complexity lower/upper bound, not
  a statistical one.

## Zeta use

Zeta is primarily an F#/.NET retraction-native DBSP
project. ML-theory surface is narrow but real:

- **DBSP chain-rule proof** — the chain-rule theorem
  in Budiu et al. (VLDB 2023) is a differentiation-
  calculus claim. The Lean-Mathlib proof lives at
  `tools/lean4/Lean4/DbspChainRule.lean`; the proof
  log at `docs/research/chain-rule-proof-log.md`. This
  skill reads the paper at proof depth and defends
  the Lean formalisation against drift.
- **Retraction-safe semi-naive evaluation** — the
  correctness argument for semi-naive evaluation in
  a retraction-native setting is a fixed-point /
  termination argument of exactly the shape this
  skill handles.
- **Speculative watermark** — the SpeculativeWindow
  operator has correctness properties (monotonicity,
  retraction-compatibility) that admit proof-shaped
  arguments.
- **Bayesian layer in `Zeta.Bayesian`** — conjugate-
  prior updates, posterior-predictive derivations;
  this skill reviews them at theoretical depth.
- **FsCheck property generators** — the distributional
  assumptions inside property tests are ml-researcher
  concerns (are generators well-conditioned? do they
  hit the tail-events the property should cover?).
- **Verification registry** — `docs/research/
  verification-registry.md` tracks which Zeta
  theorems have which kind of verification; this skill
  informs the registry's "theoretical rigor" column.

## Core principles

1. **Identifiability before estimation.** Most ML
   research failures are identifiability failures
   disguised as estimation failures. Before asking
   "how well does the estimator work," ask "is the
   parameter identifiable from this DGP at all?" If
   not, no amount of data fixes the problem.

2. **Convergence is a conditional statement.** "SGD
   converges" always has hypotheses — convex /
   strongly-convex / smooth / PL-condition / finite-
   sum / stochastic-variance-reduced. Read the
   hypotheses first, the rate second. A paper that
   drops the hypothesis in the abstract is a paper
   you read sceptically.

3. **Sample complexity is the honest currency.** Big-
   O bounds on convergence rates matter less than
   sample-complexity bounds — how many samples does
   this method *need* to get within ε of optimum?
   If the sample complexity scales exponentially in a
   problem dimension, the method does not work at
   practical scale regardless of the convergence rate.

4. **No-free-lunch theorems are not excuses.** NFL
   theorems prove that no learner dominates across
   all distributions; they do not prove that all
   learners are equal on *your* distribution. Do not
   invoke NFL to dismiss a comparison; invoke
   distributional-assumption analysis instead.

5. **Generalisation bounds are loose by design.**
   PAC bounds, Rademacher bounds, VC bounds — all
   are conservative. They bound worst-case; actual
   generalisation error is usually much better. Use
   them to *rule out* settings where even the
   conservative bound fails, not to *predict* actual
   performance.

6. **Causal claims require causal assumptions.** No
   amount of RCT / observational / experimental data
   substitutes for the identifying assumption. Backdoor
   criterion, front-door criterion, instrumental-
   variable exclusion restriction — name the
   assumption, defend it, or downgrade the causal claim
   to a correlational one.

7. **Bayesian and frequentist are interoperable, not
   opposed.** Posterior contraction rates = frequentist
   sample-complexity bounds. Credible intervals ≠
   confidence intervals (different objects) but they
   have well-defined translations under specific
   conditions. Papers that fight the other camp
   usually are missing the translation.

8. **The prior is part of the model — name it.**
   "Uninformative prior" is rarely uninformative.
   Default priors (uniform / Jeffreys / reference)
   have measurable impact on posterior inference.
   Papers that omit the prior specification are
   omitting part of the model.

## Decision table — theoretical-claim triage

| Claim type | First question |
|-----------|----------------|
| "Method X converges" | Under what hypotheses on objective / step-size / noise? |
| "Method X has rate O(1/ε²)" | What is the hidden constant? Problem-dependent? |
| "Method X identifies parameter θ" | Under what identifying assumption? Is it testable? |
| "Method X generalises" | What complexity class? Uniform or local? |
| "Method X is minimax-optimal" | Against what class? Minimax for what loss? |
| "Method X is causal" | What is the identifying strategy? Unconfoundedness / IV / RDD / DiD? |
| "Prior P is non-informative" | Under what reparametrisation? What does it say about predictive distribution? |
| "Method X beats baseline Y" | Compute-matched? Hyperparameter-matched? |

## Decision table — proof review

| Shape of claim | Review tool |
|---------------|-------------|
| Convex optimization bound | Convex-analysis textbook check; Nesterov/Beck notation. |
| Stochastic-approximation bound | Check martingale / ODE framework; Kushner-Yin style. |
| PAC / Rademacher bound | Check generalisation class, symmetrisation step. |
| Information-theoretic bound | Check Fano / Le Cam / Assouad choice; data-processing inequality application. |
| Identifiability argument | Check non-identifiability witness: are there two parameter values giving the same observable distribution? |
| Causal identifiability | Check backdoor / front-door / IV criteria; Pearl or Peters-Janzing-Schölkopf framework. |
| Convergence of an RL algorithm | Check Bellman-operator contraction or policy-improvement monotonicity. |
| Bayesian posterior contraction | Check prior mass condition + entropy / bracketing condition. |

## Common failure modes

- **Treating Big-O as a speed claim.** O(1/ε) vs
  O(1/ε²) does not imply the first method is faster
  — the constants can be 1000× different.
- **Using "SGD converges" as a universal claim.** It
  converges *under conditions*. Non-convex / non-
  smooth / heavy-tailed-noise / saddle-point settings
  have different analyses.
- **Equating correlational and causal tasks.** An ML
  estimator's predictive accuracy says nothing about
  its causal estimand's correctness.
- **Mis-reading credible and confidence intervals as
  the same object.** They are not. Each has a specific
  coverage semantics.
- **Omitting the identifying assumption.** Papers often
  slip an assumption in between the model
  specification and the proof without flagging it.
  Flag it.
- **Using empirical improvement to claim theoretical
  contribution.** A new method that works empirically
  is an engineering contribution; it is a theoretical
  contribution only if a new proof goes with it.
- **Accepting asymptotic results as finite-sample
  guarantees.** "As n → ∞" is silent on "when n =
  1000." Finite-sample bounds are the real currency
  for practical settings.

## How this hat interacts with the factory

- **Feeds Soraya.** `formal-verification-expert`
  routes theoretical claims to the appropriate proof
  tool. This skill supplies the *content* of the
  proof sketch; Soraya routes it to Lean / F\* / TLA+
  / Z3 / Alloy.
- **Feeds the verification registry.** The skill's
  triage outputs land in `docs/research/
  verification-registry.md` — the "which theorems
  have which rigor" column is authored in part by
  this skill's judgments.
- **Feeds `missing-citations`.** When a Zeta
  theorem-shaped claim lacks citations, this skill
  identifies the theoretical antecedents
  `missing-citations` should add.
- **Supports Naledi.** `performance-engineer` may
  propose a new algorithm with theoretical backing;
  this skill reviews the backing.
- **Supports Hiroshi.** The theoretical-complexity
  counterpart lives in `complexity-theory-expert`;
  hand off there for computational-complexity lower
  bounds.
- **Reads with `probability-and-bayesian-inference-
  expert`.** Bayesian learning-theoretic claims sit at
  the intersection; the probability-skill owns the
  probability structure, this skill owns the learning
  claim.
