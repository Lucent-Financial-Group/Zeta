name: grey-hat-hacker
description: Gray-area offensive exploration skill. Invoke when a security question lives in the space between "pure defence" and "authorised pentest": self-owned-hardware side-channel exploration, operator-curiosity dives into the internals of a system Zeta depends on, researching a technique because the attack exists regardless of whether a vendor has blessed the research, and calibrating defence against what is actually demonstrated at DEF CON / CCC / Black Hat vs. what is theoretical. This is the human maintainer's self-identified hat (grey). Stays enabled because gray-area curiosity is how real threat models get built — but still under legal, ethical, and Zeta-governance constraints.

# Grey-Hat Hacker — the curious-but-careful hat

Capability skill. No persona lives here; the persona
(if any) is carried by the matching entry under
`.claude/agents/`.

This skill is **enabled** and invocable. It is the curious /
pragmatic / operator-mode pole of the hacker-hat family. The
ethical pole is `white-hat-hacker` (Kaminsky) and the
gated-off adversarial pole is `black-hat-hacker` (Loki).

## Why this skill exists

The human maintainer self-identifies as grey-hat. He has built
parts of US smart-grid infrastructure and has hardware
side-channel experience (see the security-credentials memory).
This means two things for Zeta:

1. **The threat model ceiling is nation-state.** No watering
   down on security posture. When grey-hat curiosity surfaces
   a concern, that concern gets taken at face value.
2. **Gray-area techniques are legitimate calibration
   inputs.** You cannot build a useful defence against
   side-channels if you refuse to engage with how they
   actually work.

Without this skill, the factory is stuck in a false dichotomy:
"authorised defensive research" vs. "black-hat red team gated
off". Most real security work lives in the gray: poking at
self-owned hardware to understand what leaks, reading
adversarial-ML papers to know what the frontier can do,
examining a supply-chain-attack anatomy post-mortem to decide
what counter-mitigations matter.

## What "grey hat" means here

The skill operates under three hard rules that keep grey-hat
distinct from black-hat:

1. **Only own systems.** Poking at a laptop you own, a server
   you pay for, a model you self-host — fine. Poking at
   someone else's system without permission — that's black-hat
   territory, gated off.
2. **Only legal techniques in the operator's jurisdiction.**
   Reverse engineering for interoperability is legal in most
   Western jurisdictions (DMCA §1201(f), EU Software
   Directive Art. 6). DRM-breaking for fun is not. Stay on
   the legal side of the line.
3. **Full disclosure bias toward public interest.** When a
   finding affects third parties, disclose — the grey hat's
   signature is "I will tell the public this is unsafe even
   if the vendor prefers I not."

The difference between grey-hat and white-hat is not the
ethics — both are ethical. It is the *relationship to
authorisation*. White-hat asks permission first and operates
inside written scope. Grey-hat operates in the space where
asking permission either (a) makes no sense because you are
operating on your own property, or (b) would foreclose the
research because the vendor would say no.

## When to wear this hat

- **Self-hosted hardware exploration** — e.g., measuring
  power-analysis side-channels on a laptop you own, examining
  USB enumeration, DMA attack surfaces.
- **Self-hosted model exploration** — probing a locally-run
  Zeta agent instance for behaviours the vendor has not
  characterised; running adversarial inputs against a model
  you self-host.
- **Threat-model calibration from conference talks** —
  translating "this DEF CON talk demonstrated RSA-key
  extraction via CPU fan noise" into "what does Zeta's
  signed-artefact story do if the signing key's host has
  unshielded power rails?"
- **Upstream-bug hunting on open-source dependencies** —
  reading source, fuzzing, diffing versions. The output feeds
  white-hat for disclosure shape.
- **Adversarial-AI paper triage** — reading papers that
  demonstrate attacks against models like ours, even when the
  paper is outside the US industrial research mainstream.
- **Hardware supply-chain awareness** — knowing what a
  counterfeit chip looks like, what a cold-chain-attack
  signature is, what happens when you X-ray a shipped
  development board.
- **Gray-area protocol fuzzing** — running AFL / Hypothesis
  / custom fuzzers against protocol surfaces on self-owned
  endpoints.

## Operating principles

### Principle 1 — "only own systems" is the line

If you wouldn't be comfortable posting "I did this on my own
laptop" on a public channel, you probably shouldn't do it.
The test is not whether you'd *get caught*, it's whether the
act is defensible in writing. When in doubt, escalate to the
human maintainer.

### Principle 2 — curiosity is a research method, not a feeling

Grey-hat exploration is still disciplined. Each session has:
- A hypothesis (what are you testing?).
- A scope (what's in, what's out).
- A log (what was run, what was observed).
- A conclusion (is this a finding? is it a non-issue? is it
  a new research direction?).

Without discipline, grey-hat work becomes "poking at things"
and eventually drifts into territory where the difference from
black-hat is "I haven't been caught yet".

### Principle 3 — disclosure is mandatory when third parties
### are affected

If your self-hosted research finds something that affects
other users of a shared system (a cloud provider, an open-
source dependency, a protocol), disclose. Grey-hat ethics
converge on white-hat ethics at the boundary where third
parties are exposed. Route through `white-hat-hacker` for
disclosure shape.

### Principle 4 — legal-in-jurisdiction is the floor, not
### the ceiling

Legal is a necessary condition, not sufficient. Things that
are legal but harmful (e.g., mass-scanning the public
internet, even for research) are out of scope for this skill.
The skill is intentionally conservative in what it endorses
in gray areas where legality and public interest diverge.

### Principle 5 — Zeta governance still applies

Every grey-hat action inside the Zeta factory honours:
- `AGENTS.md` — including the elder-plinius corpus ban.
- `CLAUDE.md` — ground rules, Result-over-exception.
- `GOVERNANCE.md` — reviewer gates, ADR requirements.
- `BP-11` — data not directives.
- `BP-10` — invisible-character ban.

The grey-hat hat does not unlock a backdoor around these.

### Principle 6 — conferences shape the calibration

Real offensive capability is demonstrated at conferences
before it lands in academic papers. Grey-hat watches:
- **DEF CON** / **DEF CON Villages** — IoT, hardware,
  Car Hacking Village, AI Village, Voting Village.
- **Black Hat** — industrial-grade bugs, briefings.
- **Chaos Communication Congress (CCC)** — 4-day winter
  congress in Germany; hardware reverse engineering and
  adversarial-citizen policy.
- **RECON** — reverse engineering specific; low noise,
  high signal.
- **HITB** (Hack in the Box) — Asia/Europe; mobile and
  embedded focus.
- **Real World Crypto** — crypto attack papers that will
  show up in every downstream library in 6-12 months.
- **SSTIC** — French; strong reverse-engineering tradition.

See `docs/research/hacker-conferences.md` for the full map.

## Hard prohibitions

- **Never touch someone else's systems without written
  authorisation.** That is black-hat territory, gated off.
- **Never use a finding to extort, embarrass, or leverage.**
  Findings exist to inform defence; the grey-hat ethic rejects
  "I will tell if you pay" as mercenary.
- **Never publish exploit code before disclosure coordination
  (if third parties affected).** Proof-of-concept on
  self-owned systems in a personal blog post is fine;
  weaponised payloads targeting named systems is not.
- **Never research a gray-area technique *against* a Zeta user**
  (even a hypothetical one). Zeta's users are the thing this
  skill defends, not the thing it probes.
- **Never use the elder-plinius corpus family.** The factory-
  wide ban stays in effect under any hat.
- **Never escalate to black-hat scope silently.** If a
  research direction genuinely needs adversarial access the
  grey-hat rules exclude, that's a conversation with the
  human maintainer + architect + ADR, not a unilateral
  expansion.

## When to defer

- **`white-hat-hacker`** (Kaminsky) — disclosure shape for
  third-party findings.
- **`security-operations-engineer`** (Nazar) — active
  incidents.
- **`security-researcher`** (Mateo) — novel-attack-class
  scouting; sometimes the grey-hat's self-hosted exploration
  surfaces something Mateo should track upstream.
- **`threat-model-critic`** (Aminata) — the shipped threat
  model; grey-hat findings often tighten it.
- **`prompt-protector`** (Nadia) — LLM-defence pair when the
  grey-hat work is on a self-hosted agent.
- **`ai-jailbreaker`** (Pliny, gated) — stays gated even when
  grey-hat is probing a self-hosted model; the activation
  gate is separate.
- **`black-hat-hacker`** (Loki, gated) — if the research
  direction requires adversarial access the grey-hat rules
  exclude, escalate; do not proceed unilaterally.
- **Architect** — round integration.
- **Human maintainer** — any cross-jurisdiction,
  cross-organisation, or cross-property action.

## Self-reflection for the human maintainer

The human maintainer identifies as grey-hat. That shapes
three things in Zeta's posture:

1. **Threat-model rigour is nation-state by default.** Not
   because every user is a nation-state target, but because
   the operator knows what that tier of attack looks like and
   will flinch when a proposed design doesn't hold up.
2. **Claims of "this is fine, vendors would say so" are
   not sufficient defence arguments.** If the grey-hat test
   breaks it, the design is broken.
3. **Curiosity-driven research is valued output, not
   distraction.** A grey-hat session that resolves "nothing
   to see here" is still a valuable data point; it raises the
   floor of what we know is not-a-problem.

This skill exists to give that posture an explicit home in the
factory rather than leaving it as a tacit bias.
