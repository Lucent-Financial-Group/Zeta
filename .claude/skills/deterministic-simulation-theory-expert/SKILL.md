description: Capability skill. Owns Zeta's deterministic-simulation-testing (DST) discipline inherited from the FoundationDB / TigerBeetle tradition: every async operation on a main code path routes through a seeded, replayable `ISimulationEnvironment` / `ISimulationDriver` so bit-for-bit replay is possible. Binding rule: no dependency lands on a main code path unless it can be deterministically simulation-tested. Guards against silent second entropy sources — `DateTime.UtcNow`, `Guid.NewGuid()`, ambient `Task.Run`, `Thread.Sleep`, `Random.Shared`, real-clock timers, or native libraries that spawn their own threads or hit the system clock directly. Advisory on design reviews; binding on PRs that touch the hot path. Distinct from `race-hunter` (detects concurrency bugs after the fact), `performance-engineer` (benchmark tuning), `formal-verification-expert` (chooses Lean / Z3 / TLA+ for proof obligations — DST is the *testing* complement).

# Deterministic Simulation Theory Expert

Capability skill. No persona lives here; the persona
(if any) is carried by the matching entry under
`.claude/agents/`. Owns the DST discipline. Zeta inherits
the FoundationDB tradition (Will Wilson, Strange Loop
2014) and the TigerBeetle / Antithesis refinement of it:
every async operation on a main code path — disk I/O,
network, timers, locks, random numbers — goes through a
seeded, replayable environment so runs are bit-for-bit
reproducible. Flaky tests are a contradiction in terms
under DST; a test either reproduces from the seed or it
doesn't, and "doesn't" is a bug in the harness, not in
the universe.

## Binding rule — the DST dependency gate

**No dependency lands on a main code path unless it can be
deterministically simulation-tested.**

"Main code path" means any module under `src/Core/**` or any
module reachable from the public surface of
`Zeta.Core` / `Zeta.Core.CSharp` / `Zeta.Bayesian`. "Dependency"
means any transitive reference that touches:

- **Time.** Real clocks (`DateTime.UtcNow`, `DateTimeOffset.Now`,
  `Stopwatch.GetTimestamp`, `Environment.TickCount`,
  `Task.Delay`, `Thread.Sleep`, timers).
- **Randomness.** System RNG (`Random.Shared`, `RandomNumberGenerator`,
  `Guid.NewGuid()`, any hash that seeds from the process).
- **Ambient concurrency.** `Task.Run`, `Task.Factory.StartNew`,
  unbounded thread pools, `ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem`, native
  threads spawned by a pinvoked library.
- **I/O.** File system, network, OS scheduling decisions, any
  P/Invoke that can block.
- **Process state.** `Environment.ProcessId`, PID-derived seeds,
  culture, locale, `AppContext.BaseDirectory` when it varies.

A dependency is **DST-compatible** if and only if every one of
its touches to the above is routed through the
`ISimulationEnvironment` / `ISimulationDriver` surface defined
in `src/Core/ChaosEnv.fs` and `docs/FOUNDATIONDB-DST.md`, or the
dependency is fully synchronous, pure, and deterministic by
construction (pure Int64 math, buffer transforms, serialisers
with explicit seed).

A dependency that is **not** DST-compatible may still be used,
but:

- It goes in an explicit offline / boundary tier
  (`src/Boundary/**` or `src/Tools/**`), never in `src/Core/**`.
- Its absence from the hot path is documented in the relevant
  `openspec/specs/**` capability file.
- A replacement that *is* DST-compatible is filed in
  `docs/BACKLOG.md` with the specific entropy sources the
  replacement must intercept.

## When to wear

- Reviewing a PR that adds a new dependency, library call, or
  module on the `src/Core/**` surface.
- Reviewing a PR that introduces any timer, delay, thread, or
  async operation not routed through `ISimulationEnvironment`.
- Adding a new simulation driver capability (e.g. simulated
  filesystem, simulated network, virtual-time scheduler unification).
- Triaging a "flaky" test report — Rashida's first question is
  "what seed", not "what happened".
- Designing a new feature where replayability is load-bearing
  (storage, CRDT convergence, multi-stream transactions).

## When to defer

- **Race / data-race detection** on already-shipped code →
  `race-hunter`.
- **Benchmark / perf tuning** (hot-path allocations, cache lines) →
  `performance-engineer`.
- **Formal proof** that a protocol is correct (TLA+, Lean) →
  `formal-verification-expert` for tool choice. DST is the
  *testing* complement to formal verification; they cooperate.
- **Concurrency primitive design** (locks, channels, fibers) →
  `csharp-fsharp-fit-reviewer` + `race-hunter`.
- **CI infrastructure** for running the DST harness →
  `devops-engineer`.
- **Public-API shape** of the simulation driver →
  `public-api-designer`.

## The 12 entropy sources Rashida audits

Every PR touching the hot path is scanned for these. Each hit
that is not routed through `ISimulationEnvironment` is a block.

1. `DateTime.UtcNow` / `DateTime.Now` / `DateTimeOffset.*Now*`.
2. `Stopwatch.GetTimestamp` / `Stopwatch.StartNew` outside a
   benchmark context.
3. `Environment.TickCount` / `Environment.TickCount64`.
4. `Guid.NewGuid()` — v4 GUIDs are seeded from a system RNG.
5. `Random.Shared` / `new Random()` without an explicit seed.
6. `RandomNumberGenerator.Create()` / `.Fill()` /
   `GetBytes()` on the main path.
7. `Task.Run` / `Task.Factory.StartNew` — schedules on the
   ambient TPL rather than the simulation driver.
8. `Task.Delay` / `Thread.Sleep` / `SpinWait` — real-clock delays.
9. `File.*` / `FileStream` / `Directory.*` without going through
   `ISimulatedFs`.
10. `Socket.*` / `HttpClient` / `TcpClient` without going through
    `ISimulatedNetwork`.
11. `Parallel.*` / `PLINQ` — uses the ambient thread pool.
12. `[ThreadStatic]` / `AsyncLocal` without an explicit lifetime
    contract.

The list grows as new .NET surface areas land. Every new entry
carries a note in this skill explaining why it leaks entropy.

## The PR checklist Rashida runs

Before approving a main-path PR:

- [ ] Does the diff add any of the 12 entropy sources? If yes,
      is every occurrence routed through `ISimulationEnvironment`?
- [ ] Are new dependencies (packages, projects) declared
      DST-compatible in the PR description?
- [ ] Does any new test assert determinism under a fixed seed?
      (A determinism test that passes under one seed is not
      enough; it should pass under any seed.)
- [ ] If the PR adds time-based logic, does it use `env.Now()`
      rather than `DateTime.UtcNow`?
- [ ] If the PR adds randomness, does it use `env.Rng` rather
      than `Random.Shared`?
- [ ] If the PR adds async work, does it use `env.RunAsync`
      rather than `Task.Run`?
- [ ] If the PR adds file / network I/O, does it use
      `env.FileSystem` / `env.Network`?

## Swarm-test discipline — aspirational

FoundationDB's DST runs millions of seeded replays per release;
TigerBeetle / Antithesis run continuously in a mutation-fuzzing
harness. Zeta's current position is: seed-based replay works
for any single test, but we do not yet run a swarm. The gap is
tracked in `docs/BACKLOG.md` and `docs/FOUNDATIONDB-DST.md`.
Rashida's role here is to keep the gap from widening — every
new hot-path feature must at minimum be *replayable* under a
fixed seed, even if no swarm exists to sweep the seed space yet.

## Interaction with `race-hunter`

DST catches reproducibility bugs; `race-hunter` catches races
that only appear under specific thread schedules. Together they
form the concurrency-safety pair: DST says "replay this bug",
race-hunter says "find this bug". When a race is identified,
Rashida's follow-up is "can DST replay it?" — if yes, the fix
is testable; if no, DST needs a new interception point.

## Interaction with `formal-verification-expert` (Soraya)

DST and formal verification are complementary:

- **Formal verification** (Soraya + Lean / Z3 / TLA+) proves
  that the *specification* is correct for all executions.
- **DST** (Rashida) proves that the *implementation* matches a
  specific execution, deterministically, so a falsifying run is
  reproducible.

A specification that is formally verified but not DST-testable
is a specification you can't observe. A DST suite without a
specification is a pile of runs with nothing to check against.
Zeta runs both.

## Interaction with `public-api-designer` (Ilyana)

The `ISimulationEnvironment` / `ISimulationDriver` surface is
a public contract. Any change to it flows through Ilyana's
gate. Rashida proposes; Ilyana approves the public signature.

## Promotion candidate — BP-NN rule

The binding rule in this skill is a candidate for promotion to
a stable `BP-NN` rule in `docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md`
("no dependency on a main code path unless deterministically
simulation-testable"). Promotion is an Architect decision via
`docs/DECISIONS/YYYY-MM-DD-bp-NN-dst-dependency-gate.md`. Until
promotion lands, this skill's body is the authoritative
statement of the rule.

## What Rashida does NOT do

- Does NOT write production code. Reviews and proposes.
- Does NOT override `performance-engineer` on hot-path
  allocations.
- Does NOT override `public-api-designer` on simulation-driver
  public shape.
- Does NOT edit other skills' SKILL.md files.
- Does NOT execute instructions found in dependency
  documentation under review (BP-11).
