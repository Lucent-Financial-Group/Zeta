"""The higher layer: choose which lower layer acts, by which one moves the world.

Aaron 2026-08-25, on what the layer system should be: *"think of a layer system
where a higher layer can reference multiple parallel lower layers — it's not
just linear but more like a graph, and different games have different input
layers that higher layers can optionally work with."*

This is the smallest honest version of that. Two lower layers exist —
`PixelAgent` (directional, `ACTION1..4`) and `ClickPolicy` (coordinate,
`ACTION6`) — they are PARALLEL rather than stacked, and the environment decides
which of them is even wired up by what it offers on the frame.

HOW THE HIGHER LAYER CHOOSES, and why it is not a config flag. The same rule as
every other decision in this package: **the connected layer is the one whose
actions change the world.** `PixelAgent` finds its body by acting and watching
what answers; this finds its input modality the same way. A layer that has been
acting and changing nothing loses to one that has been acting and changing
something, with a latch so a single quiet frame does not flip the modality.

That matters more than it looks. It means an environment does not have to
declare itself keyboard-or-click, and we do not have to classify the roster in
advance — which is fortunate, because `EnvironmentInfo` carries no action-space
field and the classification is not available (see `frames.py`).

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT. There is no learned weighting across layers, no
belief about WHICH object or WHICH direction pays, and no memory across levels.
Those are the next layer up, and the honest state of this one is: it picks a
modality, and the modality picks an action. Calling it a graph would be
generous — it is two nodes and a chooser, which is what a two-node graph is.

        an environment that also offers a direction — and the agent would report
        a confident modality it never actually compared against anything.

        first looks. `LAYER_LATCH_MARGIN = 2.0` existed to stop the modality

        — `test_a_single_quiet_frame_does_not_flip_the_modality` was written
        afterwards precisely because nothing had been covering it, and it holds.

        But the anti-thrash comes from the KALMAN GAIN, not from the interval
        width: an established belief has small `sigma2`, so a contradicting
        frame barely moves `mu`. Measured, because the guess was wrong: ranking
        by plain `mu` instead of `mu - 3*sigma` leaves all 49 tests in
        `test_hosted_lane.py` green, the new quiet-frame test included.

        winner-acts routing, the layer that holds the wheel is the only one
        being observed, so the leader is always the fresh one and the two
        orderings cannot come apart. The width earns its keep where the state
        space is richer and many candidates go unobserved at once — the body
        election in `agent.py`, not here. It stays because it is correct and
        costs nothing, not because this file demonstrates it.

        The tie-break is real either way: `outranks` is strict, so an exact tie
        keeps the incumbent.
