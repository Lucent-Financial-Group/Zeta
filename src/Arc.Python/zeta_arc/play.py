"""Play a ZetaChase episode offline and report an ARC-shaped score.

Run:
    uv run --project src/Arc.Python python -m zeta_arc.play
    uv run --project src/Arc.Python python -m zeta_arc.play --agent random --seed 4

NO KEY, NO NETWORK — and that is now a DECISION rather than a hardcode. With
no `ARC_API_KEY` the lane runs `OperationMode.OFFLINE`, which is MEASURED to
initialise with `arc_api_key=''` and never contact the API, so it still runs on
a laptop, in CI without secrets, and in a container with egress blocked. With a
key it runs `NORMAL` and can see the hosted environments.

The mode is CHOSEN by `operation_mode_for` and REPORTED as whatever was
actually obtained — see `open_arcade`. The reported mode used to be the string
literal `"OFFLINE"` regardless of anything, which is a claim no test could
falsify. A key that is present but unreachable degrades to a scored offline
episode and says so; absence must DEGRADE, never fail.

THE SCORE, and what it is not. ARC's level formula (design doc §6) is

    S(level) = min(1.0, h/a)**2

with `a` the agent's action count and `h` a reference count. ARC uses the
SECOND-BEST HUMAN for `h`. Offline we have no humans, so `h` here is the
OPTIMAL path length computed by breadth-first search over the level's own
geometry. That substitution is stated rather than hidden: it makes this an
efficiency-against-perfect-play number, strictly harsher than ARC's, and
**not comparable to a leaderboard figure**.

       the last level, calls `win()` instead of advancing. So a loop that waits
       for `level_index` to reach the level count waits forever.

    2. The previous check for that case was `agent cell == goal cell`, which is
       true for ZetaChase and FALSE IN GENERAL. ZetaDiscovery's win is not
       standing on the `goal` — its level 1 goal is a decoy that ends nothing —
       so that proxy would silently mis-score it, and would mis-score any hosted
       environment whose win condition is not "occupy the goal sprite".

    `GameState.WIN` is what the engine actually sets, so it is what this reads.
