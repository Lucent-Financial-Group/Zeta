    The agent had learned the obstacles by bumping and then walked into one of
    them for the rest of the episode, because `blocked` was written by
    `_note_blocked_cell` and read only by `_route_plan`. Whenever the router
    returned no plan, the greedy fallback re-issued a move into a cell it knew
    was solid — and re-issued it forever, since the heading never changes while
    the agent does not move.

    The threshold is 60%, not "never": this environment has legitimate repeats,
    and the claim under test is that no single action consumes the episode. The
    pre-fix run was 95.5%.
