"""Falsifiers for the ARC_API_KEY mode decision.

The rule these defend (design doc §3.2): *degrade, do not fail*. No key must
never mean no episode, and a key that cannot reach the API must never mean no
episode either.

NOTHING HERE TOUCHES THE NETWORK. The policy is tested as a pure function, and
the degradation path points at `http://127.0.0.1:1` — connection refused
instantly, so the test is fast and deterministic rather than dependent on the
internet being down in the right way. A real key is never needed and must never
