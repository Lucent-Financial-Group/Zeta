/**
 * erasure-charge.ts — the CHARGE side of the erasure vocabulary, and the TypeScript oracle for
 * `src/Core/ErasureCharge.fs`.
 *
 * `erasure-class.ts` says what an operation *is*. `entropy-tracker.ts` is a ledger that charges.
 * Nothing joined them: the tracker's five call sites each hand it a number computed by
 * `erasure-derivation.ts`, and the declared classifications — the ones backed by an exhaustive
 * sweep, checked in both directions — were charged by nobody at all. This module is the join, and
 * it holds **no roster of its own**: `dispositionOf` reads `classification` and `evidence`, never
 * `representation`, `operation`, or `observation`.
 *
 * That restriction is the whole lesson of the correction that produced this apparatus. A list of
 * erasing operations keyed by NAME was written twice and was wrong twice, and cannot be made right
 * in principle, because `TruncateAsync` is erasing under one backend and reversible under another.
 * A second list is the defect, so there is no second list.
 *
 * ## `unmeasured` does not charge zero
 *
 * Three treatments were available for an operation nobody has swept: charge `0` (the demon —
 * a channel that reads as free because the ledger is closed), charge a stated upper bound (there
 * is none to state without **inventing a coefficient**), or refuse the fold and carry the hole in
 * the total's type. The third is taken. `settle` returns a `Reading` that is either `complete`
 * with a total, or incomplete with the measured sum **and the named holes**; `readTotal` refuses
 * to hand back the number without the flag. A `LowerBound` is also the physically correct
 * direction, since Landauer's `kT ln 2` is a floor.
 *
 * ## Bits are never summed across observations
 *
 * A representation's operation can carry opposite classes under two observations and both be
 * honest — `ZetaFsDeltaLog.TruncateAsync` is erasing through the log's read surface and unmeasured
 * on the physical medium. Summing those produces a number describing no observer, so `settleAll`
 * returns one reading **per observation** and offers no way to collapse them.
 *
 * ## Cross-oracle agreement is the point (BP-16)
 *
 * The F# module and this one implement the same four-case disposition rule over the same
 * declaration shape. `erasure-charge.test.ts` and
 * `tests/Tests.FSharp/Formal/Erasure.Charge.Laws.Tests.fs` assert the same dispositions on the
 * same fixture profiles, so a divergence in either implementation is caught by the other. Two
 * independent tools on one property is what makes this evidence rather than a claim.
 *
 * Anchors (Beacon): Landauer 1961 (`kT ln 2` per *erased* bit — a floor, hence the lower bound);
 * Bennett 1973 (a bijection pays nothing, hence `free` requires a *measured* fibre of 1);
 * Goguen-Meseguer 1982 (noninterference — the charge crosses a declared, metered door).
