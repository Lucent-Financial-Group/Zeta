/**
 * self-vendored-provisioning.ts — the ceremony model for a device WE provision, and its refusals.
 *
 * Work-item 081M00VJGAV087G0R00393F6X5 ("self-fabricated TKey: become our own vendor").
 *
 * ## What is implemented here, stated before anything else
 *
 * **Nothing in this file provisions, attests, seals, signs, burns, or verifies anything.** There is
 * no cryptography, no USB, no NVCM write, no network call, and no key of any kind. No TKey, no TP-1
 * programmer, and no fabricated board was available to the author; **every physical step below is
 * UNEXERCISED** and is marked as such in `PROVISIONING_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS`, which a test forces
 * to enumerate the whole ceremony so a new step cannot be added without an honesty entry.
 *
 * What IS implemented is the part that needs no hardware and no undecided policy: **the order of the
 * ceremony, and the conditions under which it must refuse to proceed.** The refusals are the entire
 * value of the module — an ordering that accepts everything constrains nothing, and a provisioning
 * check that cannot fail asserts an identity nobody verified.
 *
 * ## Why the model can land before the hardware
 *
 * From the repo's own survey
 * (`docs/research/2026-08-14-open-source-hsm-and-fido-devices-we-can-fabricate-and-modify-plus-research-fpga-class.md`
 * §1, checked 2026-08-14), the load-bearing finding is that **integrity and authenticity separate**:
 *
 *     CDI = BLAKE2s(UDS ‖ USS ‖ BLAKE2s(app))
 *
 * The identity on the device is a *function of the code running on it* — arithmetic, no CA, no
 * network. Fabricating the board ourselves leaves that property untouched. What self-fabrication
 * costs is the answer to *"is this a genuine X and not a clone?"*, which structurally needs someone
 * other than you. Tillitis' own tool says the vendor is a **parameter**: a TKey provisioned by "your
 * IT department" is verified by *their* `tkey-verification`, not Tillitis'. So becoming our own
 * vendor does not delete the root — it **relocates it to us**.
 *
 * And Tillitis states its own tool's ceiling, quoted rather than softened:
 *
 * > "The verification of this identity does not prove that the TKey hasn't been tampered with, only
 * > that the identity of an app running on it is the same."
 *
 * ## What this module deliberately does NOT decide
 *
 * Three questions are **maintainer decisions** and are modelled as undecided values that FAIL
 * CLOSED, in the shape of `Wall.Whitebox` in `src/Core/DerivationProtocol.fs` — unknown is not
 * permissive:
 *
 * 1. **Who holds the vendor root** (`VendorRootCustody`, default `"undecided"`).
 * 2. **Whether the root is single or plural** — see `deferenceReading`, which reports the shape as a
 *    neutral fact and attaches no verdict.
 * 3. **By what mechanism a human approves a sensitive step.** This module requires a *named
 *    approver* for irreversible and authority-exercising steps, because those are already a gated
 *    class here; it does **not** name the mechanism. Biometric, passphrase, and in-person are all
 *    consistent with this code. Requiring attribution is inherited standing discipline; choosing the
 *    mechanism would be extending it.
 *
 * ## The topology question, asked out loud
 *
 * Per `.claude/rules/itron-hub-patent-boundary-p2p-is-the-upgrade.md`, the discriminator between an
 * **oracle** (a concentration you may route around — chosen) and a **hub** (one you must route
 * through — enforced) is **exit**, not degree. A self-vendored root is on the wrong side of that
 * line for one of the two questions, and `deferenceReading` reports exactly which:
 *
 * - **Integrity** — no authority is involved at all; a stranger recomputes the CDI relation
 *   themselves. Exit is total.
 * - **Authenticity** — with exactly one root, a verifier *must* defer to it. That is a **single
 *   mandatory trust authority**, and no amount of it being *our* root changes the shape. It is named
 *   here rather than argued away.
 *
 * ## Anchors (Beacon)
 *
 * - Tillitis TKey measured boot / `tkey-verification` vendor-as-parameter — via the repo survey above.
 * - Hirschman, *Exit, Voice, and Loyalty* (1970) — exit is what disciplines a concentration.
 * - Goguen & Meseguer (1982) noninterference — secrets cross only declared channels; here, the
 *   record type has no channel that can carry a UDS at all.
