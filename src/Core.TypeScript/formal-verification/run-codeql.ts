// run-codeql.ts — reproduce a CodeQL alert locally, over a scoped set of paths, in one command.
//
// THE MEASUREMENT THAT MOTIVATED IT. A PR spent SIX round-trips failing on CodeQL alerts, each
// round a guess at what the analyser would accept, because the only feedback loop was CI. The
// same alerts reproduce locally in about fifteen seconds — measured 2026-09-10 on the committed
// fixtures: 6s to build a scoped database over four files, 9s to run javascript-security-extended
// over it. The knowledge was never the bottleneck; the two-command dance was, because nobody
// remembers `--codescanning-config` and a pack-qualified suite path under pressure.
//
//   bun src/Core.TypeScript/formal-verification/run-codeql.ts <path...>
//
// and it prints `rule  file:line  message`, one line per finding.
//
// WHY IT WRAPS RATHER THAN DOCUMENTS. A remembered third-party invocation is a dependency on
// somebody's memory; a wrapper is a dependency on a file under review. The flags this one hides
// are not cosmetic — `--codescanning-config` is what makes the database SCOPED (6s) instead of
// whole-repo (minutes), and it is also the exact mechanism `github/codeql-action` uses, so the
// local run and the CI run differ in inputs rather than in method.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT: a customisation path. `.github/codeql/custom-queries/zeta-security/README.md`
// records the measurement that settles this — a `barrierModel`/`sinkModel` data extension is
// honoured by a query compiled inside a local pack and IGNORED by the shipped query, through
// every delivery route including `--codescanning-config`. So there is no `--model-pack` flag
// here and there should not be one: what closes a first-party alert is a guard in the code that
// the DEFAULT taint barriers already recognise. This tool exists to show you the alert, fast,
// so that guard can be written and checked without a CI round-trip.
//
// EXIT CODES, and the third one is the point:
//   0  the analysis ran and reported nothing
//   1  the analysis ran and reported findings
//   2  the analysis COULD NOT RUN (no CLI, unusable arguments, a CodeQL failure)
// A tool that returned 0 for "nothing found" and "never looked" would be the vacuity class:
// its silence would read as a clean bill of health. Exit 2 says the question was not answered.
