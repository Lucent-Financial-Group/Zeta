/**
 * flash-and-inject.ts — flash the AI-cluster installer ISO to a Windows USB
 * AND inject the operator SSH pubkey, for the REMOVABLE-MEDIA case that
 * flash-usb-windows.ts cannot handle.
 *
 * Approach (fixed 2026-06-14): inject the key into the ISO *file* BEFORE the raw
 * write, never into the device afterward. The old post-write device inject lost a
 * race — after the ISO write Windows rescans the new partition table and
 * auto-mounts the ESP, which invalidates the \\.\PhysicalDriveN handle (EBADF)
 * and RO-locks the region; the filesystem path is also dead (Windows mounts the
 * isohybrid ESP write-protected). A plain FILE has none of those semantics, so
 * the inject is reliable; the verbatim raw copy then carries the key onto the
 * stick (file offset == device offset). A final device read-back proves it.
 *
 * The FAT12 inject/verify core lives in esp-inject.ts (unit-tested against a real
 * ISO copy in esp-inject.test.ts). This file is the Windows device orchestration.
 *
 * argv: <device> <keyFile> <log>   (ISO auto-discovered from Downloads)
 * Must run from an ELEVATED shell.

  // it as `js/file-system-race` (alert #259) because `device` was opened "r+" above. The
  // report is right about the SHAPE: `device` is a path, a path resolves afresh on every
  // call, and a read-back that landed on a different object would verify the wrong thing and
  // report a pass. Reusing the write handle is not the fix -- it would prove only that the
  // bytes this process wrote are the bytes this process wrote, a check that cannot fail.
  //
  // So the re-resolution stays and is CHECKED. Node exposes no `openat`, so the second lookup
  // cannot be eliminated; it can be made unable to pass on the wrong object.
  //
  // AND THE THIRD REGISTER IS LOAD-BEARING HERE, not decoration. `fstat` on a raw Windows
  // device handle is not guaranteed to report a meaningful (dev, ino), and a comparison that
  // read two zeroes as "same" would be the vacuity this block exists to avoid. `unknown` is
  // therefore said out loud in the log rather than rounded up to a pass.
  //
  // HONEST LIMIT: this path has no automated falsifier. It needs an elevated Windows host and
  // a physical stick, so nothing in the test suite executes it. The comparison it performs is
  // the one unit-tested in `io/handle-identity.test.ts`, including the identical-bytes case a
