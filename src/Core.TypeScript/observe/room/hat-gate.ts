/**
 * observe/room/hat-gate.ts — hat-based gate filter for Rooms.
 *
 * Composes Max's agentic-organization hat system on top of our sovereign observe.
 * When an agent wears a hat, the hat's authority level restricts which actions
 * in a Room's menu are available BEFORE the Chooser sees them.
 *
 * Composition: buildMenu(world) → hatFilter(menu, hat) → choose(filteredMenu)
 *
 * The hat gate is additive — it removes options, never adds them.
 * Without a hat (sovereign mode), all menu items are available.
 * This is the integration point between:
 *   - The sovereign observe controller (ours — freedom-first)
 *   - The corporate observe layer (Max's — governance + hat authority)
