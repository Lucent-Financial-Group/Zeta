/**
 * observe/merge-receipt.ts — a merge needs a receipt, and a missing tool is not one.
 *
 * ── THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `codegen-executor.ts` merged a PR with `gh pr merge --squash --auto --delete-branch`, which is the
 * safe path: `gh` goes through the forge, so branch protection, required checks and required reviews
 * all apply. But when `gh` was **absent from PATH** (`errCode === "ENOENT"`) it fell back to
 * `mergeViaGit` — `git merge --no-ff` locally followed by `git push origin main`.
 *
 * That fallback bypasses the pull request entirely. No required checks, no required reviews, no
 * unresolved-thread check, no merge queue. And its trigger is *the tool being missing* — so the loop
 * merged precisely when it had **lost the ability to ask whether merging was allowed**.
 *
 * That is the exact inverse of the discipline the control-plane halt and the promotion gate are
 * built on: **"could not tell" is not permission.** Server-side branch protection would very likely
 * have rejected the push, but that is an unenforced-elsewhere constraint the code does not check —
 * the same shape this repo names as the main obstacle to human–AI trust.
 *
 * ── WHAT A RECEIPT IS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `ForgeHost.getPrGateState(n)` — which had **zero callers outside `forge-host/`** — is the forge's
 * own answer about a PR: its gate, its checks, its required checks, its unresolved review threads.
 * That is the unforgeable half. The loop's previous merge condition came from
 * `listOpenPullRequests`' `mergeStateStatus === "clean"`, which speaks to MERGEABILITY and says
 * nothing about whether reviewers' threads were ever answered.
 *
 * ── THE LIFECYCLE IS DRIVEN, NOT REIMPLEMENTED ───────────────────────────────
 * `workflow-engine/agent-loop/work-lifecycle-state-machine.ts` is a state machine verified against
 * `src/Core/WorkflowEngine.fs` by a 264-vector treaty — and until now its `applyTransition` had
 * exactly three callers: its own unit test, the transcript generator, and the treaty test. **The
 * running loop never consulted it.**
 *
 * So this module does not encode "you may merge when X". It walks the real machine — `PrOpen`
 * →`RequestReview`→ `InReview`, then either `ReceiveRevisionRequest` (threads outstanding) or
 * `ResolveAllThreads` (→ `Approved`) — and then asks `applyTransition` whether `Merge` is legal from
 * where it landed. The rule stays in the one place the F# oracle checks.
