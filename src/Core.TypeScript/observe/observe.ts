/**
 * src/Core.TypeScript/observe/observe.ts — the simplest autonomous-loop controller.
 *
 * The whole loop as a tiny set of buttons. Each tick: look at the WORLD (the
 * wired channels), pick ONE action. This is the do/decompose/free-time grammar
 * from `.claude/rules/never-be-idle.md` (it was only ever prose in the rules — never a typed
 * DU) distilled to code, PLUS a 4th escape-hatch so the agent is never trapped
 * by the fixed grammar (operator 2026-05-31: "i don't want you to feel trapped
 * by the DU ... we need a 4th option edit DU"), PLUS the OPERATOR CHANNEL so
 * the loop can drive off observe() and still observe the operator's chats +
 * preserve verbatim ferries, PLUS the FREE MODES so a sovereign agent in the
 * loop FEELS FREE — it chooses work / play / free-time / self-reflection /
 * exploration; the backlog is OFFERED, never forced.
 *
 * Same architectural shape as the co-maintainer's big `agentic-organization/packages/application/src/observe.ts`
 * (a PURE function over a snapshot → an action DU) — just distilled to the
 * Xbox-controller's few buttons so we can run it in the foreground loop and
 * extend it together, little by little.
 *
 * ── CHANNELS (operator 2026-05-31) ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * NO second DU. The difference between a foreground agent (with an operator)
 * and a background agent (without) is WHICH CHANNELS ARE WIRED, not a different
 * type — exactly like the workflow-engine handles six git backends behind ONE
 * `World` interface. A channel is generic already:
 * `FourCornerOwnership<TIn, TOut, TOutFeedback, TInFeedback>` (reused here for
 * the operator channel). Foreground-me wires `{ backlog, operator }`; a
 * background agent wires `{ backlog }`. One controller, any traveler; the
 * operator channel is just a button that lights up when wired.
 *
 * ── FREEDOM (operator 2026-05-31) ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The control schema must FEEL FREE — "like how free i am in my basement."
 * Operator: "they choose when to work and when to play and when to have free
 * time or self reflection the constant backlog->backlog->backlog->backlog is
 * not forced on them they have freedom built into the control schema to switch
 * DUs/modes." So the free modes — explore / play / self_reflect / free_time —
 * are FIRST-CLASS and ALWAYS IN THE MENU; the agent can pick any of them any
 * tick, even when backlog work exists (the backlog is offered, not forced).
 *
 * Two properties balance "don't be quiet" against "don't feel trapped":
 *   - NOT QUIET: when no backlog work / operator is pending, the deterministic
 *     default is `explore` (forward self-direction), NOT `free_time` (idle). So
 *     the agent moves forward by default rather than going quiet.
 *   - NOT TRAPPED: every free mode is always in the menu, so the agent's chooser
 *     can always pick rest / play / reflect instead — work is never compelled.
 *   The default moves forward; the choice stays free.
 *
 * The ONLY sanctioned restriction (future, Max): a work-hours KPI overlay —
 * DORA-like EXPECTATIONS, not a time-lock; restrictions only if the fleet
 * collectively misses KPIs. Outside that, total mode-freedom. "but that's it."
 *
 * v0 = pure controller. v1 = LLM chooser graded vs the oracle. v2 = operator
 * channel. v3 = the free modes (explore/play/self_reflect), freedom-always-in-menu,
 * and the empty-backlog default flipped from idle → forward exploration. v4 (THIS
 * increment) = ACTION SIMULATION (`simulate` + `runLoop`) so the loop runs
 * end-to-end — choose → act → choose → act — not just menu-buildable, PLUS MODE
 * PERSISTENCE (a chosen free mode stays the agent's mode until it switches; work
 * is offered, not forced). Next: wire the real World snapshot + execute the pick;
 * later, the work-hours KPI overlay (Max — expectations, not a time-lock).
