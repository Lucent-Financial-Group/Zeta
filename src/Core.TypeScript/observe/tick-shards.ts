/**
 * tick-shards.ts — the per-write shard store behind the observe metrics ledger.
 *
 * WHY SHARDS
 * ----------
 * `data/tick-history.json` used to BE the ledger: one mutable file that every
 * tick-metrics run appended to and pushed to main. That shape forces coordination —
 * two writers touching one path is a merge conflict by construction, and it grows
 * without bound (560 frames / 165KB after five weeks, ~96 frames/day and rising).
 *
 * The fix is the shape already proven in-tree by `workitems/events/YYYY/MM/DD/<hash>.json`
 * and `docs/agent-heartbeats/<persona>/YYYY/MM/DD/<zetaid>.md`: one file per write, under
 * a date shard, named so that no two writers can ever pick the same path. Then the merge
 * is set union — commutative and idempotent (disciplines #2 lock-free, #6 idempotency) —
 * and conflicts become structurally impossible rather than merely unlikely.
 *
 * `data/tick-history.json` REMAINS, but demoted from ledger to DERIVED ROLLUP: a pure
 * function of the shard set, regenerated on every run, bounded to the most recent
 * ROLLUP_MAX_FRAMES. Two properties follow:
 *
 *   - `data/monitor.html` (and any other Pages reader fetching the same URL) keeps
 *     working with no change: same path, same `{ provenance, frames }` shape. A static
 *     page cannot list a directory, so it needs a single file to fetch; the rollup is
 *     that file.
 *   - A merge conflict on the rollup is no longer a coordination problem. The rollup
 *     carries no information the shards do not, so the resolution is always "take the
 *     union of shards and regenerate" — never a hand-merge.
 *
 * The rollup being bounded is what retires the unbounded-growth problem for this file:
 * the archive lives in the shards, the served file stays a fixed size.
 *
 * WHY THE FILENAME IS A ZetaId
 * ----------------------------
 * The first cut of this file named shards `<HHMMSSmmm>-<sha256[0:8]>.json`. That is a
 * private, ad-hoc key: nothing else in the repo can resolve it, no bit-field can be read
 * out of it, and it carries no category — so a tick frame was addressable only by the two
 * scripts in this folder. ZetaId is the repo's universal 128-bit pointer (the F# type
 * providers, the database layer, and the Roslyn surfaces all parse it), so a durable
 * record's key belongs in that space. Aaron 2026-08-13: *"i think we should be using zeta
 * id under the folder structure somewhere … zetaid is our universal pointer system … we
 * have bit parsing."*
 *
 * The shape now matches the two proven in-tree event ledgers, which are the closest
 * neighbours to this one: `docs/observe-events/<zetaid>.json` and
 * `workitems/events/YYYY/MM/DD/<zetaid>.json` — date-sharded directories (bounding the
 * fan-out) with a bare 32-hex ZetaId as the filename (the id IS the identity).
 *
 * CATEGORY = Observation (0), NOT a new registry slot
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * A tick frame is a measurement of the observe loop's own state at time `t` — computed by
 * the `observe/` subsystem, from the observe event log, and described by `data/monitor.html`
 * as the observe ledger. `registry/categories.yaml` id 0 is exactly that, so no registry
 * entry is minted (adding one would be a schema change across all oracles, and reuse of a
 * fitting category beats minting a new one). Deliberately NOT:
 *   - `Heartbeat` (3) — liveness of an agent, not an aggregate of the society's state;
 *   - `FrictionTelemetry` (5) — reserved for the friction signals of ADR 2026-05-29.
 *
 * Note the neighbouring ledgers do NOT set a good example here: `mintObserveEventIdHex`
 * tags observe-events `Category.WorkItem` (8), which is category drift we copy the *shape*
 * of and not the *value* of.
 *
 * DETERMINISM: THE ID IS CONTENT-DERIVED, NOT ENTROPY-MINTED
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * `new-workitem.ts` keeps its mint DST-clean by injecting clock + randomness through an
 * environment boundary at the CLI. This mint goes one step further and takes NO entropy at
 * all — both ZetaId inputs are pure functions of the frame:
 *
 *   - the ZetaId `timestamp` field  ← the frame's own `t`, its observation time. Never a
 *     local mint clock, so a backfilled historical frame gets the id it would have got
 *     when it was first written; no id ever implies a mint time that did not happen. (This
 *     is also `local-time-never-enters-the-shared-fold`: the frame's phase, not our clock.)
 *   - the ZetaId `randomness` field ← the top 32 bits of the sha256 of the frame's
 *     canonical JSON — the *same* 32 bits that used to be the `-<sha256[0:8]>` filename
 *     suffix, so the old key is still recoverable from the new id.
 *
 * Two consequences, both of which the previous scheme also had and neither of which is
 * weakened: the SAME frame always lands at the SAME path (discipline #6 idempotency —
 * re-running a tick is an upsert), and two writers in the same millisecond with different
 * frames land on different paths (different digests). Collision resistance is unchanged at
 * 32 digest bits *within one millisecond*. What is gained: zero ambient entropy (#13
 * noninterference), so the whole shard store replays byte-identically under DST.

 *   - Changing it RE-KEYS NOTHING: all 1675 shards on disk were re-derived under both comparators
 *     and zero changed id, because every `MetricsFrame` key is lowercase ASCII where the two orders
 *     agree. The test pins that equivalence, so it stays a check rather than a measurement somebody
