// ═══ THE LIVE CORPUS — the finding is not hypothetical ════════════════════
//
// While building this, the verifier was pointed at the committed
// `docs/observe-events/` and found eleven attestation records whose attestor is a
// FILESYSTEM PATH: `/tmp/attest-0rHTQr`, `/tmp/attest-4EC3oi`, `/tmp/attest-hqFnhO`.
// Those are `mkdtempSync` fixture directories from this module's own end-to-end
// tests. They were written by a real run, committed, and merged to `main` on
// 2026-08-17 (heartbeat batch #11689). Nothing objected, because the only check any
// consumer performed was `^[0-9a-f]{32}\.json$` on the FILENAME, which they pass.
//
// This is finding (1) already realised, without an adversary: three personas that
// do not exist and never could now permanently attest `alexa` — and each other —
// contributing three "distinct attestors", ~4.58 total strength, and
// `hasTrioAttestation: true` to any fold that ever reads them. A leaked test fixture
// and a deliberate impersonation are the same event to every check that existed.
//
// They are NOT deleted. They are real recorded facts about what this system did, and
// Memory Preservation (manifesto §5) applies to embarrassing history too — the same
// call `audit-observe-event-filenames.ts` `FROZEN_LEGACY_NAMES` made about the three
// hex-JSON filenames. They are pinned here instead, as the falsifier: if the persona
// check regresses, these stop being refused and this test goes red.
