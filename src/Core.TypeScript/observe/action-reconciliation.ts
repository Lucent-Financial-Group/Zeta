/**
 * observe/action-reconciliation.ts — the single authoritative `NextAction.kind` table.
 *
 * Ported from `agentic-organization/docs/STATE_RECONCILIATION.md`, which solves the same problem one
 * layer up: work-item state was named differently by the Work OS, the V0 schema, the UI and the
 * event names, and the fix was **one table, held as a `Record` so the compiler enforces
 * exhaustiveness** — *"adding a `WorkItemState` is a type error until a row is supplied (OCP — a new
 * state breaks the build, not just a runtime test)."*
 *
 * ── THE DIVERGENCE THIS SIDE ACTUALLY HAS ────────────────────────────────────
 * `NextAction` has 16 kinds, and knowledge about each kind was spread across four surfaces, three
 * of which **failed open** on a kind they had never heard of:
 *
 *   room/hat-gate.ts   `isAuthorized`        `default: return true`  — ungated at every hat level
 *   room/room.ts       `isActionInScope`     trailing `return true`  — in scope for every room
 *   grammar-16-render  `leadSlot`            `default: return null`  — no slot (benign, but silent)
 *   grammar-16-render  `FREE_MODE_KINDS`     a private const listing four kinds by hand
 *
 * A `default: return true` is the vacuity class in gate form: it looks like a decision and decides
 * nothing. Add a 17th kind tomorrow and it is authorized everywhere, in scope everywhere, and
 * nobody's test goes red. The table replaces each of those with a lookup, so the 17th kind fails to
 * COMPILE instead.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS TABLE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO ─────────────────────────────────
 * It does not invent the `kind -> slot` projection. `grammar-16.ts` says that projection is the next
 * slice and is *"left OPEN here on purpose — fabricating a clean total mapping would paper over a
 * real design question"*. So `leadSlot` here records only what the existing renderer already
 * answers, and `null` means *the ADR has not assigned one*, never *there isn't one*.
 *
 * Likewise `not_yet_assigned` is a real, named row value rather than a silent `true`: the
 * cartography / time-travel / memory-sector kinds are ungated **today**, and this table is where
 * that is visible and countable instead of implicit in a fall-through. Naming a gap is not closing
 * it — closing it is the grammar owner's call, and `UNGATED_KINDS` is pinned by a test so the set
 * can only change deliberately.
