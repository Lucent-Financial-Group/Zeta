 * f4-question-bias-run.ts — sequences generations and writes raw JSONL. Nothing else.
 *
 * STATUS: toy. Every metric and its falsifier live in `f4-question-bias.ts` /
 * `.test.ts`; this file makes no claim and computes no statistic.
 *
 *   bun f4-question-bias-run.ts role               # domain R, small models, replicates 0-119
 *   bun f4-question-bias-run.ts preference         # domain P, small models, replicates 0-119
 *   bun f4-question-bias-run.ts role-large         # domain R on the 7B, for the size question
 *   bun f4-question-bias-run.ts role-block2        # domain R, replicates 120-239
 *   bun f4-question-bias-run.ts preference-block2  # domain P, replicates 120-239
 *
 * Raw generations land in `data/f4-question-bias/` as JSONL so every number in the
 * research doc is recomputable offline, without a model and without a GPU. Runs are
 * resumable: an interrupted run skips the rows already on disk, in the same order.

 * PARSE a generation result into an `AnswerRow`. Never cast one.

 * `unknown` in fact whatever it claims in the type, and this function is where that lie is
 * settled. `raw` / `promptTokens` / `evalTokens` are network-sourced; `ms` is measured
 * locally and is validated only so the row has one uniform gate.
 *
 * The defect this closes: with the cast alone, a response of `{"eval_count": {"a": 1}}`
 * put an object into a numeric field, `JSON.stringify` wrote it out happily, and
 * `f4-question-bias-analyze.ts` — which casts again on `JSON.parse(line) as Row` — folded
 * it into statistics without anything throwing. Nothing in the path could fail, which is
 * the vacuity class: a check that cannot fail is not a check.
 *
 * Note what is deliberately NOT rejected: control characters in `raw`. A model answering
 * in 24 tokens may legitimately emit a newline, and the newline is part of the datum.
 * `serializeRow` is what keeps that safe on disk.

 * for newline and CR, six for NUL and surrogates), never as literal bytes. That is what
 * lets model text be stored VERBATIM without a response splitting one row into two.
 *
 * But that escaping is load-bearing and invisible — nothing in the old code said the
 * record boundary depended on it, so an edit swapping the serializer for a template
 * literal would have corrupted every downstream statistic silently. The check below makes
 * the dependency explicit and loud.
 *
 * `assertSingleRecord` is separate and exported for one reason: folded into `serializeRow`
 * it could not be reached through the public API, because `JSON.stringify` never emits a
