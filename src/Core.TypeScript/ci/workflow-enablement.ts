// workflow-enablement.ts -- a workflow DISABLED IN THE FORGE is a check that did not run
// looking like one that passed.
//
// THE CONDITION, AND WHY EVERY EXISTING GUARD MISSES IT
// -----------------------------------------------------
// GitHub Actions carries a per-workflow "state" that is administrative, not textual:
// active, disabled_manually, disabled_inactivity. A workflow can sit at its correct path,
// fully valid, referenced by prose and by rosters, and produce ZERO runs forever because
// somebody pressed "Disable workflow" in the UI or called
// PUT /actions/workflows/{id}/disable. Nothing about the repository changes. No run
// appears, so no run can be red. The check does not fail -- it stops existing.
//
// EVERY GUARD THIS REPO ALREADY HAS IS A GUARD OVER TEXT, so none can see it:
//   * lint-no-nested-workflow-dirs.ts -- "a workflow file GitHub will never read is not a
//     check". The nearest sibling, and it reads PATHS. A disabled workflow sits at a path
//     GitHub reads perfectly well; it simply refuses to dispatch it.
//   * lint-linter-coverage-vs-ci-invocation -- "a configured linter must be an invoked
//     one". It finds the invocation in the YAML. The YAML is correct.
//   * lint-workflow-job-timeouts, lint-drift-publication-lands, the workflow-shape
//     falsifiers -- all read the committed file.
// The state lives ONLY in the forge, so only a live query can see it.
//
// MEASURED 2026-09-09 on Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta: 16 of 105 workflows were
// disabled_manually, and no surface in the repository named that fact.
//
// THEY WERE DISABLED ON PURPOSE, and this file is NOT a case for turning them back on.
// The maintainer (Aaron, 2026-09-09) stopped the cadence/heartbeat lanes because they
// were growing the repository uncontrollably: several hold contents:write and COMMIT on
// every scheduled run -- drift-sweep.yml writes a tick event to docs/drift-events/ per
// cadence -- so re-enabling one resumes exactly what was removed. The registry records
// them as `intentional` and the audit is content with that forever.
//
// SO WHAT IS THIS FOR. Visibility, and nothing more. A workflow that produces no runs
// produces no red X, so its silence is invisible by construction, and this repository has
// no other surface that can see it. The value is in the DELTA: the seventeenth
// disablement nobody wrote down, an entry that quietly comes back to life, a roster row
// that has gone stale. Those are the findings. The recorded sixteen are furniture.
//
// A design note, deliberately not a work item: verdict-drought.ts runs in two hosts on
// purpose ("a drought detector that lives only inside gate is cancelled by exactly the
// condition it exists to report"), and drift-sweep was the second one. That redundancy is
// currently gone. Restoring it would need a NON-COMMITTING host, which is a later design
// question and not a defect to be filed now.
//
// WHAT IT DOES, AND THE BASELINE DISCIPLINE
// -----------------------------------------
// registry/workflow-enablement.json records every workflow known to be non-active, with a
// reason and a classification. The fold compares that record against the live state.
//
//   BLOCKING (exit 1) -- the register moved and nobody wrote it down:
//     undeclared-disabled       non-active in the forge, absent from the registry. THE
//                               NEXT SILENT DISABLEMENT LANDS HERE.
//     stale-baseline-now-active the registry names a workflow that is running again. A
//                               roster claiming a closed gap teaches readers to skip the
//                               row that names an open one.
//     baseline-path-absent      the registry names a path the forge does not list at all
//                               (renamed, deleted) -- an entry that can never be true.
//     malformed-entry           no reason, or an unknown classification. A roster row with
//                               no reason records nothing.
//
//   LOUD BUT NOT BLOCKING (exit 0) -- the recorded, still-true state:
//     known-disabled / intentional  a decided answer.
//     known-disabled / unreviewed   a warning annotation per entry plus a count. These are
//                               the 16 measured above: recorded as FACT, explicitly NOT as
//                               approval, printed on every run so that "unreviewed" cannot
//                               quietly become "fine".
//
// WHY THE UNREVIEWED SET DOES NOT GO RED. gate.yml states the reason in its own words: "a
// red X nobody must clear is a red X nobody reads." Sixteen findings nobody on this branch
// has the authority to resolve would paint a permanent red on the drift (loud) job and
// train every reader to ignore it -- destroying the signal this file exists to add. The
// check is non-vacuous from its first run all the same: it is armed against the
// SEVENTEENTH disablement, against any of the sixteen coming back, and against its own
// roster going stale. Same baseline shape audit-tick-shard-relative-paths already uses.
//
// ITS OWN LIVENESS -- HOW THIS DETECTOR FAILS, STATED PLAINLY
// -----------------------------------------------------------
//   * THE LISTING COMES BACK EMPTY (token denied, API change, wrong repo) -> register
//     unmeasured, exit 2, never 0. An empty population is not a clean one.
//   * THE LISTING IS TRUNCATED. The API paginates at 100. A disabled workflow on a page
//     that never arrived would be invisible, and every registry entry on that page would
//     read as baseline-path-absent. foldEnablement therefore takes totalCount and refuses
//     to fold a listing shorter than it: register unmeasured, exit 2.
//   * THE STEP NEVER EXECUTES because its host job was cancelled. This is the one failure
//     this file cannot self-report -- the same honest limit verdict-drought.ts states. It
//     is not papered over: it is why the roster it protects matters, since the first thing
//     to go quiet is the thing nobody is watching.
//
// PLACEMENT: DRIFT TIER, AND THAT IS FORCED, NOT PREFERRED
// ---------------------------------------------------------
// This is a LIVE POPULATION QUERY -- "what workflows are out there right now" -- and
// floor-live-remote-queries.ts refuses exactly that inside the blocking floor, for a
// measured reason: a pre-merge gate verdict must be a function of the CANDIDATE, never of
// repo-wide state the candidate cannot touch. A PR adding a comment must not go red
// because somebody disabled a cadence lane an hour earlier. So this rides in drift (loud),
// which already holds actions:read and already goes red beside a green required check.
//
// DISCIPLINES. Noninterference (13): foldEnablement is pure -- no clock, no network, no
// filesystem; every crossing happens in main(). Idempotency (12): same listing + same
// registry => byte-identical report. Culture-invariant: ordinal comparison only, never
// localeCompare.
//
// Usage:
//   bun src/Core.TypeScript/ci/workflow-enablement.ts --repo <owner/name>
//   bun src/Core.TypeScript/ci/workflow-enablement.ts --observations <file.json>
//
// Exit 0 = live enablement matches the registry (unreviewed entries are warnings).
// Exit 1 = the registry and the forge disagree; the finding names the workflow.
// Exit 2 = the check could not run. Never confused with exit 0.

 * branch, so the taint path is intact however well the value was checked. Validation
 * narrows what an attacker can put in a file; it does not stop the file depending on
 * remote data. (The validation is KEPT -- see `sanitizeObservation` -- because it is worth
 * having on its own merits. It is simply not what closes this.)
 *
 * So the flow is broken structurally instead: NOTHING network-derived reaches the file.
 * This function emits counts (numbers), the register (a local union), and fixed prose.
 * Every string here is a literal in this file.
 *
 * THE DETAIL IS NOT LOST, it moves to a channel that is not a file: the full markdown
 * still goes to stdout, and every finding still emits a `::error::` / `::warning::`
 * annotation. Those are the surfaces a reader actually uses for findings; the step summary
