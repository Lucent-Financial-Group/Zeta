// drift-loud.test.ts -- falsifiers for the loud-but-non-blocking drift fold.
//
// Every test here fails if the line of the fold it covers is removed or inverted. The
// four that carry the design are:
//
//   * a STEP-level swallow (green job, red step) is detected -- the class that had no
//     detector anywhere in the repo, and the class the live canary is a specimen of;
//   * a long clean streak DEMOTES a band to `HEALED` -- the structural fix for the
//     unbounded-window alarm that stayed lit for twelve days after its defect was gone;
//   * the window is BOUNDED before anything is counted, so an old failure cannot be
//     resurrected by adding history;
//   * `assertDetectorLive` goes RED when the canary is absent -- silence fails the
//     check, which is the only thing keeping this surface from becoming the next one
//     that quietly stops working.
//
// And one that is about what this must NOT do: a failure that sat beside a RED rollup is
// not absorbed, because it blocked the merge and is somebody else's problem.
