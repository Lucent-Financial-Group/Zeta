// verdict-drought.ts -- how long has `main` gone with NO COMPLETED GATE VERDICT?
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE CONDITION, AND WHY NOTHING SAW IT
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `gate.yml` uses a per-ref concurrency group with `cancel-in-progress`, and a merge to
// `main` cancels the run still in flight for the previous merge. That is a correct and
// deliberate setting. What it produces, when merges arrive faster than the gate can
// finish, is a `main` whose recent commits carry NO VERDICT AT ALL -- not a pass, not a
// fail, just `cancelled`.
//
// Measured on `Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta`, 2026-08-23T17:35Z:
//
//     last SUCCESS on main:  10fbd9a4  16:29:06Z -> 16:43:22Z   (~52 min earlier)
//     last VERDICT on main:  7dbd2b11  17:11:52Z -> 17:25:00Z   (`failure`, ~10 min)
//     last 8 gate runs:      6 cancelled, 2 running, 0 success
//     gate duration:         ~14 min when allowed to finish
//     merge interval:        17:30:13, 17:30:29, 17:30:37   <- three merges in 24 s
//
// Merges outran the gate by roughly an order of magnitude. Note the two numbers above
// are DIFFERENT facts and this file reports both: the *verdict* drought is what says
// whether `main` is being checked at all, and the *success* drought is what says whether
// it is green. Only the first is the vacuity class.
//
// THE DEFECT IS THAT `cancelled` READS AS NEITHER PASS NOR FAIL. Every surface in this
// repo that folds gate outcomes -- `platform-drift-report.ts`, `gate-scope-summary.ts`,
// `drift-loud.ts` -- reasons about runs that EXECUTED. A window of nothing but
// `cancelled` produces no findings in any of them, and no findings renders as green.
// `drift-loud.ts` has this exact hole today: hand it 60 cancelled runs and `subjects` is
// empty, `sustained` is empty, and it prints "EXIT 0 -- no sustained drift". It is not
// wrong about drift; it is silent about the fact that nothing was measured.
//
// A CHECK THAT DID NOT RUN MUST NEVER LOOK LIKE A CHECK THAT PASSED. That is the whole
// of this file.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE ERROR THIS FILE IS THE CORRECTION OF (owned, 2026-08-23)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Earlier the same day I looked at this cancellation pattern, reasoned that a later
// successful run covers the earlier commits, and called it benign. The reasoning has a
// premise -- that there eventually IS a later success -- and the premise is exactly what
// the condition removes. At 50 minutes with ~20 commits landed and no success, the
// conclusion had already failed. I found it by counting conclusions by hand, and a
// detector that has to be asked is not a detector.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE REGISTER DISCIPLINE: `unknown` IS FIRST CLASS AND NEVER AGGREGATES TO GREEN
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Aaron: "UNKNOWN is a first-class verdict that can never aggregate into green."
// So the fold has THREE outcomes, not two:
//
//   `ok`       -- a completed verdict (`success` OR `failure`) landed on `main` within
//                 the threshold, and few enough commits have landed since it.
//   `drought`  -- a verdict exists but is too old, or too many commits have landed on
//                 top of it. The blast radius is named, loudly.
//   `unknown`  -- there is NO completed verdict anywhere in the observed window, or the
//                 window itself could not be observed. The drought cannot even be
//                 measured, which is strictly worse than a long one. This never reports
//                 as `ok` and it is deliberately the loudest register.
//
// `cancelled`, `skipped`, `timed_out`, `stale`, `neutral`, `action_required` and an
// in-flight run are ALL non-verdicts. The enumeration is a strict allow-list of two
// (`isVerdict`) rather than a deny-list, because the failure that matters is a
// non-verdict being counted as one -- that direction turns a drought green, and a
// deny-list gets that wrong every time GitHub adds a conclusion string.
//
// A `failure` IS A VERDICT. The check is about verdict PRESENCE, not verdict COLOUR.
// Reading it the other way round would make a red `main` -- which is being checked,
// loudly, and is therefore in a *known* state -- look like an unchecked one.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT IT DOES *NOT* DO -- SCOPE, DELIBERATELY
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// It does not change the concurrency group, add a merge queue, or touch any flush
// cadence. Those are the three policy options on the table and choosing between them is
// a human call. This file exists so that whichever is chosen can be VERIFIED afterwards
// -- the same number, measured the same way, before and after. It presumes no answer.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// LOUD, NEVER BLOCKING
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `::error::` annotations plus `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`. No `gate (required)` dependency
// is added, no `needs:` list is touched, no required check learns about this. It rides
// in two EXISTING surfaces rather than becoming a fourth parallel mechanism:
//
//   1. the `drift (loud)` job in `gate.yml` (#14283) -- already built to go red beside a
//      green required check;
//   2. the `drift-sweep` job -- which is where it actually catches the condition, because
//      `drift-sweep` has its own concurrency group with `cancel-in-progress: false` and
//      therefore SURVIVES the merge storm that cancels every gate run. Measured during
//      the storm above: `drift-sweep` concluded `success` at 17:30:37 -> 17:34:32 while
//      four consecutive gate runs were being cancelled.
//
// That second host is not redundancy for its own sake. A drought detector that lives
// only inside `gate` is cancelled by exactly the condition it exists to report -- it
// would be silent precisely when it matters, which is the defect wearing a detector's
// clothes.
//
// IT PUBLISHES NOTHING. No commit, no push, no artifact on `main`. `drift-sweep.yml`'s
// push to `main` has been rejected by the "CI Gate" ruleset since 2026-08-13 while the
// workflow reported green, and `drift-dashboard-cadence.yml:98` has the same
// `git push origin HEAD:main || echo "::warning::"` shape. Loud therefore lives in the
// RUN, where nothing has to land for it to be seen. If this ever needs to persist, the
// route is to park on `heartbeat/*` and flush via PR (`agent-heartbeat.yml`), never a
// direct push.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ITS OWN LIVENESS -- HOW THIS DETECTOR FAILS, STATED PLAINLY
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The repo has now rediscovered three times that a detector can stop working and keep
// reporting green. So here is exactly how this one fails, and what it does about it:
//
//   * **The window comes back empty** (token denied, wrong workflow id, API change).
//     -> register `unknown`, `::error::`, non-zero exit. Never `ok`. `assertDroughtDetectorLive`
//     makes this a named verdict rather than a lucky consequence of an empty loop.
//   * **The commit-count channel fails** (the compare base was force-pushed away).
//     -> `unverifiedCommits` is `null`, said out loud in the reasons, and NEVER silently
//     rendered as `0`. A missing count is not a small count.
//   * **Commits land on `main` and no gate run appears at all.** -> `runsSinceVerdict`
//     stays 0 while `unverifiedCommits` climbs; `triggerLooksBroken` names it, because
//     that signature is a broken TRIGGER, not a slow gate.
//   * **The step never executes**, because the job hosting it was cancelled. This is the
//     one failure mode the file cannot self-report, and it is why it runs in two hosts
//     with different concurrency groups. If BOTH go quiet the condition is invisible
//     again -- that limit is real and is not papered over here.
//

//
// CodeQL `js/http-to-file-access` ("Network data written to file") flagged the two
// writes at the bottom of this file, and it was RIGHT -- not about the path, which is a
// constant in both cases (`$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` from the runner, `--out` from argv), but
// about the CONTENT. Fields from the Actions API reached two STRUCTURED formats by string
// concatenation:
//
//   * the `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` markdown TABLE -- a `|` splits a cell, a newline ends the
//     row and the table, and everything after it renders as fresh document structure;
//   * the `::error title=...::message` WORKFLOW COMMAND -- a newline there forges a second
//     command in the runner's log stream, which is the well-known Actions command-injection
//     surface.
//
// It is tempting to call this a false positive because the fields are, in fact,
// well-formed today: the listing is filtered to `?branch=main&event=push`, so `head_sha`
// is a git-computed sha and `conclusion` is a GitHub enum. But that argument is a claim
// about the SERVER, checked nowhere, restated every time the query changes -- and this
// file exists because "a check that did not run must not look like one that passed".
// A response body is untrusted input; the honest answer is to make the injection
// impossible to EXPRESS rather than to argue it will not occur.
//
// So each value is matched against an anchored shape and, on failure, REPLACED by a fixed
// self-describing constant. Not sanitised, not escaped, not repaired -- replaced. No
// value that reaches the renderer can carry a `|`, a newline, a backtick or a `::`,
// because no value that reaches the renderer came from the network unchecked.
//
// TWO PROPERTIES THIS MUST NOT BREAK, and both are tested:
//   1. Replacement is LOUD, never silent normalisation into something that looks fine.
//      The sentinels are visibly not shas, not instants, not conclusions.
//   2. An unrecognised conclusion is NEVER a verdict. `isVerdict` is an allow-list of
//      exactly two strings, so an unknown value cannot become one by being replaced --
//      which is the direction that would turn a drought green.
//
// "EVERY value" above was a claim, and it was FALSE when first written: `compare.ahead_by`
// came from a second call and reached the fold, the table and the `--out` artifact behind
// nothing but `typeof x === "number"` -- which admits `NaN`. CodeQL kept reporting the
// alert through exactly that field while three commits hardened the fields around it, so
// the alert was not stale and was not noise; it was pointing at the one door still open.
// `constrainCount` closes it, and it is the only value here whose sentinel is `null`
// rather than a string, because the report already has a NOT-MEASURED register for counts.
