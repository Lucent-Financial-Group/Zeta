// floor-live-remote-queries.ts — refuse a LIVE POPULATION QUERY inside the blocking floor.
//
// THE MEASURED DEFECT. PR #15308 added new files and touched nothing else. It went red in
// `cross-verify` because FOUR ARCHIVE RECORDS WERE STRANDED REPO-WIDE — a condition it
// neither caused nor could fix. It re-ran green with zero code change, because flush PRs
// landed in the interval. Two agents independently reported it, and both first read it as
// "the vectorisation broke the four-language oracles", because `cross-verify`'s headline
// step is the byte-lock. So: repo state a PR cannot touch, blocking that PR, wearing the
// costume of a correctness failure.
//
// A CHECK THAT CLEARS ITSELF ON RE-RUN IS ALREADY BEING ABSORBED AS FLAKE, and that is the
// sharpest reason this is not merely untidy. The only remedy available to the author was
// "press re-run until it passes" — which is the exact reflex that lets a genuine red be
// clicked away. The blocking placement was not buying enforcement; it was buying a
// re-run habit.
//
// THE PROPERTY, STATED SO IT IS CHECKABLE
// ---------------------------------------
// A pre-merge gate's verdict must be a function of the CANDIDATE (its diff, its tree, its
// commits) — never of the live population of everybody else's in-flight work. This is not a
// new policy: `registry/uncompensatable-floor.yaml` already says the floor "never blocks on
// pre-existing whole-repo drift (Vera review, #9601 P1)", and `gate.yml` already states the
// rule for a neighbouring case in its own words — the ArgoCD chart check is offline against
// a committed snapshot, "which is the only reason a resolvability check survives past its
// first outage."
//
// WHAT IS DETECTED, AND WHY IT IS ENUMERATION RATHER THAN "THE NETWORK"
// --------------------------------------------------------------------
// "No network in the floor" is too broad to be true here and would have to be exempted into
// meaninglessness: `gate-required` itself calls `gh api --paginate` to read THIS RUN'S OWN
// job list, which is a fact about the candidate and cannot be moved by anyone else's work.
//
// The discriminator that actually separates the good case from the bad one is ENUMERATION.
// A point lookup names an object; a population query asks "what is out there right now",
// and only a population query can make a candidate's verdict depend on other people's
// unlanded work. So the roster below is deliberately short and every entry is a
// *whole-population* read of a live remote.
//
// WHY ONE HOP WAS NOT ENOUGH — MEASURED, NOT ARGUED
// --------------------------------------------------
// This file shipped with the limit "ONE HOP: `bun x.ts` is resolved and x.ts is read; a
// query inside a module x.ts imports is NOT followed." That limit was honest and it was
// also a fuse. On 2026-08-26 `cross-verify` was restructured from 31 inline steps into a
// 31-leg matrix whose every leg runs `bun src/Core.TypeScript/ci/cross-verify-roster.ts
// --run <id>`; the roster then invokes each audit's own `bun …` command. That inserted a
// SECOND hop between `gate.yml` and `audit-orphaned-archive-refs.ts`, and the guard went
// from rc=1 to rc=0 — measured at both trees, with the tool's `git ls-remote` still sitting
// untouched at `audit-orphaned-archive-refs.ts:251`. Only the detector moved.
//
// That is the vacuity class arriving by STRUCTURAL CHANGE rather than by authoring: nobody
// edited this file, nobody edited the audit, and a floor check silently stopped checking.
// A refactor two files away must not be able to switch a falsifier off, so resolution now
// walks the graph transitively, bounded and cycle-guarded, and the bound is stated below
// as plainly as the old one-hop limit stated its own.
//
// HONEST LIMITS, stated because they bound the claim (same shape as derive-job-closure.ts):
//   * BOUNDED DEPTH, NOT UNBOUNDED. Resolution follows two edge kinds transitively from a
//     `run:` block — `bun <path>.ts` invocations (wherever they appear, including inside a
//     string in an already-visited file, which is exactly how the roster names its audits)
//     and RELATIVE local imports/re-exports (`./x`, `../y/z.ts`). It stops at
//     `MAX_RESOLUTION_HOPS` (see below) and never revisits a file, so a cycle terminates.
//     Bare specifiers (`node:fs`, npm packages) are not followed at all. This is a floor
//     with a stated reach, not a proof of absence.
//   * SHELL INDIRECTION IS STILL OPAQUE. A tool invoked as `bash foo.sh`, through `xargs`,
//     through a Makefile, or by a `run:` that sources a script is not followed. Neither is
//     a dynamic `import()` with a computed specifier, nor a path built at runtime.
//   * LITERALS ONLY. `spawnSync(bin, args)` with a computed command is unresolvable by
//     reading. Nothing here pretends otherwise.
//   * A ROSTER, NOT A DERIVATION. Population-query forms are enumerated by hand. It is
//     small, checkable, and its entries carry their reason — and it fails LOUD rather than
//     silently: a new form nobody added is simply not caught, which is a gap, not a
//     false clean bill of health for something it did examine.
//
// Usage:  bun src/Core.TypeScript/ci/floor-live-remote-queries.ts [--root <dir>] [--json]
// Exit 0 = the blocking floor's verdict cannot be moved by repo-wide state it can see.
// Exit 1 = it can, and the finding names the job, the tool, and the query.
// Exit 2 = the check could not run (unreadable workflow, missing root job).
