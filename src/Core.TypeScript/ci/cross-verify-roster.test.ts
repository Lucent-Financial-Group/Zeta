// cross-verify-roster.test.ts -- the falsifiers for the 31-way `cross-verify` split.
//
// Two things have to be true for the split to be an improvement rather than a hole:
//
//   1. THE ROSTER AND THE MATRIX CANNOT DIVERGE. As of 2026-08-26 the matrix is not a
//      second list at all: it is GENERATED from the roster into a delimited region of
//      `gate.yml`, and the same command is the drift check and the fix. §"generation"
//      proves the round trip is byte-identical, that a hand-edit is caught and named,
//      that one command moves both views, and — the mutation — that a generator reading
//      an EMPTY roster cannot pass. §"parity" keeps the id-level diagnosis honest.
//   2. THE FLOOR IS NOT WEAKENED. A decomposition that quietly makes 31 audits
//      non-blocking is a silent floor removal — the worst available outcome and the
//      easiest to reach by accident. §"the floor is not weakened" runs the aggregate
//      job's OWN committed shell against every result GitHub can produce.
//
// The second is deliberately not a test of a TypeScript function. The thing that has to
// hold is a property of `gate.yml`, so `gate.yml` is what is read and what is executed.
