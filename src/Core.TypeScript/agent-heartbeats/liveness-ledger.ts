/**
 * src/Core.TypeScript/agent-heartbeats/liveness-ledger.ts — the PR-free recording channel for
 * liveness observations.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES.
 *
 * `heartbeat-liveness.yml` produces a verdict about whether the fleet is ticking. Until this
 * module existed that verdict was durable ONLY as a check-run annotation on an Actions run, and
 * an annotation has three properties that make it the wrong sink for this particular observation:
 *
 *   1. It lives inside the substrate being observed. If Actions is degraded — the exact condition
 *      the watchdog exists to report — the report degrades with it.
 *   2. It is written only when the run reaches the step that writes it. A run that dies in
 *      `Checkout` or `Setup bun` produces no annotation, and "no annotation" is indistinguishable
 *      from "nobody looked". An observation channel that cannot distinguish HEALTHY from
 *      NOT OBSERVING is the vacuity class: it looks like coverage and constrains nothing.
 *   3. It is not in git, so no reader with a clone can answer "when was the fleet last observed?"
 *      without an API call to the provider whose health is in question.
 *
 * And the recursion Aaron named: routing the observation to `main` through the flush PR would
 * make the report of a broken pipeline depend on that pipeline. **The observer must not depend on
 * the observed.** Same family as a retry loop probing over the transport it is saturating, and a
 * failure reporter that runs `bun` when the failing step is the one installing `bun`.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS INSTEAD.
 *
 * An append-only ledger on a dedicated ref, `refs/heads/liveness/observations`, written by direct
 * push. Verified on 2026-08-27 against the live repository rulesets:
 *
 *   - `CI Gate` (required_status_checks) has `conditions.ref_name.include == ["~DEFAULT_BRANCH"]`.
 *     Its ONLY bypass actor is `RepositoryRole 5` with `bypass_mode: pull_request`, so nothing —
 *     admin included — pushes to `main` without a PR today.
 *   - `Branch Safety` (deletion, non_fast_forward) and `Default`: also `~DEFAULT_BRANCH` only.
 *   - `Heartbeat Branch Protection` (deletion) targets `refs/heads/heartbeat/*` only.
 *
 * So a `liveness/*` ref is reachable by direct push with the workflow's own scoped
 * `GITHUB_TOKEN`, requires no bypass actor, no ruleset change, and no credential that could reach
 * `main`. It is the mechanism `heartbeat/*` already uses, pointed at the observation layer.
 *
 * THE ORPHAN-REF CHOICE. The ledger's first commit has no parent and shares no history with
 * `main`. Three consequences, all wanted: a writer never has to fetch `main` to append (so the
 * recording path does not depend on `main` being fetchable), a reader fetches only the ledger's
 * own small history, and the ref can never be mistaken for a branch that is trying to merge.
 *
 * WHAT `main` WOULD HAVE BOUGHT, STATED HONESTLY. Exactly one thing: presence in the default
 * fetch refspec, hence discoverability without a reader instruction. That is recovered the way
 * this repo already recovers it for `heartbeat/*` — a fetch line in `CLAUDE.md`. Everything else
 * people mean by "on main" (durable, in git, no PR, readable from a clone, diffable, replayable)
 * is a property of being a git ref, not of being `main`.
 *
 * WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT BUY, ALSO STATED HONESTLY. This writer runs inside GitHub Actions, so a
 * total Actions outage stops the WRITING as well as the ticking. The ledger does not fix that —
 * nothing inside Actions can. What it fixes is that the gap becomes READABLE: because a record is
 * written on EVERY run including the healthy ones, a reader computes the age of the newest record
 * and gets a straight answer to "is anyone still observing?". `assessObserverContinuity` below is
 * that reader, and it is the whole reason the healthy-case write is mandatory rather than an
 * optimisation.
