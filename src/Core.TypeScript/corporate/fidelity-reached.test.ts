/**
 * fidelity-reached.test.ts — what a run COULD do, and what it DID, kept apart.
 *
 * Two defects, and the first hid the second.
 *
 * A. THE FACT WAS MISSING ON EVERY EARLY RETURN. `runOrgRuntime` has three `return empty()` paths,
 *    all of them before the emission. `empty()` carried `fidelity` in the RETURNED report, so a
 *    live caller was fine and the store was not. Measured on a run with no workable goal,
 *    persisted exactly as both CLIs persist it:
 *
 *        the RUN RECORD says : {"replayable":true,"realPorts":[]}
 *        the EVENT LOG says  : []
 *        they disagree       : true
 *
 *    Two records of one fact in one store. `everyRunWasSimulated` and `--resume` read the LOG, so
 *    a resumed organization printed "no run recorded its fidelity — UNKNOWN, not simulated" about
 *    a run whose fidelity was sitting in the same store. Same shape as the `identifyEvent` loss:
 *    two views, one silently short. And the same early-return hole `runOrgCycle` had closed one
 *    pass earlier, in that pass's own words — its sibling was never checked.
 *
 * B. "TOUCHED SOMETHING" IS NOT WHAT `realPorts` MEASURES. It is derived from the ProviderSet's
 *    LABELS. Measured: a run with a real review port and no workable goal reported
 *    `realPorts: ["review"]` with ZERO gate evaluations — the reviewer was configured, not called.
 *
 *    `replayable` stays configuration-derived and conservative, deliberately: a set holding a real
 *    adapter cannot be promised to replay whether or not THIS run reached it. Only the sentence
 *    overreached, so only the sentence changed.
