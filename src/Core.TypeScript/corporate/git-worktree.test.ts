/**
 * git-worktree.test.ts — two changes open at once, which the sibling adapter cannot survive.
 *
 * `gitChangeControl` moves the shared HEAD with `checkout -b`, so two open changes in one
 * repository fight over which branch is checked out and whose files are on disk. Nothing breaks
 * today because the runtime is sequential — but that is a property held by an accident of the
 * CALLER, not by the adapter, and limits of that kind stop being true silently.
 *
 * The first test here is the one that earns the adapter: it opens two changes without closing the
 * first, writes different content in each, and merges both. Run against `gitChangeControl` it
 * would be a mess of clobbered files; here each change has its own directory and its own HEAD.
