/**
 * corporate/goal-cascade.ts — a company goal reaching a dev, one accountable rung at a time.
 *
 * ── THE GAP THIS CLOSES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The canonical package's work items (`backlog/new-workitem.ts`, `work-items/types.ts`) are FLAT:
 * `type` is `"task" | "bug"`, there is no parent pointer, and no work item names an owner. So there
 * was no way to express the thing the corporate register is built around — that a goal held by the
 * C-suite decomposes into initiatives held by directors, projects held by managers, and tasks held
 * by leads, each rung accountable to the one above.
 *
 * Without the edge, "the organization is working on the goal" is an assertion nobody can check, and
 * "the goal is done" is a state someone sets rather than a fact about the work beneath it.
 *
 * ── THE LADDER ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   goal        → C-suite      direction and portfolio priority
 *   initiative  → Director     the department that will carry it
 *   project     → Manager      staffing and sequencing
 *   task        → Lead         short-cycle work sequencing
 *   (execution) → Individual Contributor, by assignment — not a rung
 *
 * The IC is deliberately NOT a rung. A rung is a unit of work that decomposes; an IC does not
 * decompose a task, it does it. Modelling execution as a fifth rung would produce a work item per
 * dev per task that nobody ever closes separately from the task itself.
 *
 * ── OWNERSHIP IS DERIVED, NOT ASSIGNED ───────────────────────────────────────
 * A child's owner must REPORT UP to its parent's owner, walked over the same `reportsTo` edges the
 * chart is validated on. A cascade whose rungs are not connected in the supervisor graph is an org
 * chart drawn twice that agrees by luck — the tree would look right while describing a reporting
 * line that does not exist, and every escalation along it would route into another department.

/**
 * ── THE RUNG ORDER, AND WHY IT DIFFERS FROM THE REFERENCE ────────────────────
 * The reference's product shape reads
 *
 *     Goal -> Project -> Initiative -> Work Item -> Task / Defect / ...
 *
 * which puts `Project` ABOVE `Initiative`; this ladder has them the other way round. That looks
 * like a straight contradiction and is not one, because the two documents are using the top arrow
 * for different KINDS of edge.
 *
 * The reference defines a Project as a *"long-lived product, platform, repo family, customer area,
 * or internal system"*. A long-lived product CANNOT be the child of a single goal: goals are
 * accepted and delivered while the product persists across all of them, so `Goal -> Project` there
 * is an ASSOCIATION — this goal concerns that product — not a decomposition. Its `Initiative`, a
 * *"prioritized body of work with owner, scope, budget, required gates"*, is the first rung that
 * actually decomposes.
 *
 * This cascade models decomposition edges ONLY: every node has one parent, and delivery rolls up
 * from the leaves (`isDelivered`). Under that reading the ladder is goal -> initiative -> project
 * -> leaf, where `project` means a unit of delivery inside an initiative rather than a long-lived
 * container. The vocabularies reconcile as:
 *
 *   | here        | reference        |
 *   |-------------|------------------|
 *   | goal        | Goal             |
 *   | initiative  | Initiative       |
 *   | project     | Work Item        |
 *   | leaf types  | Task / Defect / Capability Request / Review / Incident |
 *   | (nothing)   | **Project** — the long-lived container |
 *
 * So the real divergence is not an inverted pair; it is a MISSING RUNG. There is no long-lived
 * container above goals here, and adding one is a portfolio concern rather than a fix to this
 * ladder — recorded as an open gap rather than papered over by renaming a rung that already means
 * something else.

 * When NONE of them can support the next rung, the nearest is still returned rather than
