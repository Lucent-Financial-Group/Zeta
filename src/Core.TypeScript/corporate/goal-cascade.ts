/**
 * corporate/goal-cascade.ts — a company goal reaching a dev, one accountable rung at a time.
 *
 * ── THE GAP THIS CLOSES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The canonical package's work items (`backlog/new-workitem.ts`, `work-items/types.ts`) are FLAT:
 * `type` is `"task" | "bug"`, there is no parent pointer, and no work item names an owner. So there
 * was no way to express the thing the corporate register is built around — that a goal held by the
 * C-suite decomposes into initiatives held by directors, projects held by managers, and tasks held
 * by leads, each rung accountable to the one above.
 *
 * Without the edge, "the organization is working on the goal" is an assertion nobody can check, and
 * "the goal is done" is a state someone sets rather than a fact about the work beneath it.
 *
 * ── THE LADDER ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   goal        → C-suite      direction and portfolio priority
 *   initiative  → Director     the department that will carry it
 *   project     → Manager      staffing and sequencing
 *   task        → Lead         short-cycle work sequencing
 *   (execution) → Individual Contributor, by assignment — not a rung
 *
 * The IC is deliberately NOT a rung. A rung is a unit of work that decomposes; an IC does not
 * decompose a task, it does it. Modelling execution as a fifth rung would produce a work item per
 * dev per task that nobody ever closes separately from the task itself.
 *
 * ── OWNERSHIP IS DERIVED, NOT ASSIGNED ───────────────────────────────────────
 * A child's owner must REPORT UP to its parent's owner, walked over the same `reportsTo` edges the
 * chart is validated on. A cascade whose rungs are not connected in the supervisor graph is an org
 * chart drawn twice that agrees by luck — the tree would look right while describing a reporting
 * line that does not exist, and every escalation along it would route into another department.

/**
 * The ladder, top-down. Index is depth.
 *
 * ── THE RUNG ORDER, AND WHY IT DIFFERS FROM THE REFERENCE ────────────────────
 * The reference's product shape reads
 *
 *     Goal -> Project -> Initiative -> Work Item -> Task / Defect / ...
 *
 * which puts `Project` ABOVE `Initiative`; this ladder has them the other way round. That looks
 * like a straight contradiction and is not one, because the two documents are using the top arrow
 * for different KINDS of edge.
 *
 * The reference defines a Project as a *"long-lived product, platform, repo family, customer area,
 * or internal system"*. A long-lived product CANNOT be the child of a single goal: goals are
 * accepted and delivered while the product persists across all of them, so `Goal -> Project` there
 * is an ASSOCIATION — this goal concerns that product — not a decomposition. Its `Initiative`, a
 * *"prioritized body of work with owner, scope, budget, required gates"*, is the first rung that
 * actually decomposes.
 *
 * This cascade models decomposition edges ONLY: every node has one parent, and delivery rolls up
 * from the leaves (`isDelivered`). Under that reading the ladder is goal -> initiative -> project
 * -> leaf, where `project` means a unit of delivery inside an initiative rather than a long-lived
 * container. The vocabularies reconcile as:
 *
 *   | here        | reference        |
 *   |-------------|------------------|
 *   | goal        | Goal             |
 *   | initiative  | Initiative       |
 *   | project     | Work Item        |
 *   | leaf types  | Task / Defect / Capability Request / Review / Incident |
 *   | (nothing)   | **Project** — the long-lived container |
 *
 * So the real divergence is not an inverted pair; it is a MISSING RUNG. There is no long-lived
 * container above goals here, and adding one is a portfolio concern rather than a fix to this
 * ladder — recorded as an open gap rather than papered over by renaming a rung that already means
 * something else.

 * is false in ten of sixteen departments and refused decomposition to protect a structure the
 * organization does not have. Replacing it with "only leaves need anything" fixed that and left a
 * subtler version of the same defect:
 *
 *   business_analysis has ONE manager, `business_approver`, and it supervises nobody. Its director
 *   supervises five contributors. A project routed to the manager therefore could not be broken
 *   down at all, and the register reported a hiring shortfall for a department that had five people
 *   in it.
 *
 * The requirement that survives both is the one that was always the point: **an owner must be able
 * to reach somebody who can do the work.** A rung whose candidates are all sterile is skipped, the
 * search descends, and the director owns the project — which is what actually happens when a
 * manager has no team.
 *
 * It is a FILTER, not a preference, and that is what makes the search descend rather than hand back
 * an owner it already knows cannot staff anything. Where an entire line has no contributors — the
 * CFO's, in this chart — the refusal comes at the FIRST decomposition instead of three rungs later,
 * which says the true thing sooner: nothing under this hat can be done by anyone.
 *
 * EXPORTED BECAUSE TWO CALLERS NEED IT AND THERE MAY ONLY BE ONE ANSWER. `decompose` asks it to
 * pick an owner, and `generative-work.breakdownOpenings` asks it to decide whether to OFFER the
 * decomposition at all — the menu's own rule is that it must never offer an act the organization
 * will refuse. When the two computed it separately they disagreed the moment one changed, and the

 * ── THE MEASUREMENT THAT FORCED THE LADDER TO BEND ───────────────────────────
 * `CASCADE_RUNGS` names one owner level per work type: initiative to director, project to manager,
 * task to lead. That is a six-level organization, and this one is not. Counted across the seeded
 * chart's sixteen departments:
 *
 *   - **six directors have no manager beneath them** (architecture, security, documentation,
 *     observability, the RMO, the policy steward)
 *   - **nine managers have no lead beneath them**
 *   - **only four departments have a lead rung at all**
 *
 * Most departments are director then contributors, directly. That is not a defect in the seed; it
 * is what the reference organization looks like, and inventing an `architecture_manager` to satisfy
 * a table would be fabricating an org chart to make a loop terminate.
 *
 * So the LADDER bends. A rung with nobody at its nominal level is owned by the nearest supervisory
 * level below it, and failing that BY THE PARENT ITSELF — a director with no manager owns its own
 * projects, which is exactly what happens in a small department and exactly what the reference
 * shows. Accountability rolls up; it never evaporates.
 *
 * ── `mustSupportLevel` IS NOW A FILTER, NOT A TIE-BREAK ──────────────────────
 * It used to nudge the sort: a candidate that could carry the next rung sorted ahead of one that
 * could not, and one that could not still won when it was alone. That produced owners who could
 * staff nothing — the failure surfaced a rung later as an assignment refusal naming a hat nobody
 * had chosen. As a filter it makes the search DESCEND instead: if nobody at this level can reach a
 * contributor, the rung belongs further down, and that is a question this function can answer
 * rather than one it should pass on.

 *   - open or in-progress with NO children yet -> live (it needs breaking down)
