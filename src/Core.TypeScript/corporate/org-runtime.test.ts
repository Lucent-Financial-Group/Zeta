/**
 * org-runtime.test.ts — the end-to-end proof for the WHOLE register.
 *
 * `org-cycle.test.ts` proves the delivery loop. This proves the pipeline that surrounds it: a
 * customer report arrives, is de-duplicated and triaged, is prioritized by an authority, becomes a
 * goal, cascades to owned tasks, is staffed by ranked assignment into real expiring bindings, is
 * scheduled, is picked up by the dev's OWN observe tick, is claimed and reviewed through the work
 * market, is verified by QA, crosses seven gates, and comes back delivered.
 *
 * Assertions are on organizational STATE — the cascade, the bindings, the queue, the board — not on
 * the event log. The log is the runtime's account of itself, and an account is the easiest thing to
 * make look right.

  // gate chains one at a time, real multi-minute Claude calls included, because the runtime's own
  // staffed-task loop `await`ed each task's walk before starting the next — regardless of whether
  // anything actually required that order. `ferry` at its default dop is byte-identical to that
  // loop; this proves the OTHER half — that raising it genuinely lets independent tickets' calls
  // run at the same time, not just that the flag is accepted and silently ignored.
  //
  // A review port that RECORDS ITS OWN START AND END, not one that returns instantly, because a
  // sequential and a concurrent run look identical if nothing in the fake port takes measurable
  // time — the exact way a bug here could hide behind a test that finishes either way.

  // OCCUPANCY, NOT ELAPSED TIME. The property under test is "were two reviews inside at the
  // same time", and the first version of this reached for it through an 80ms `setTimeout` plus
  // `performance.now()` timestamps. That made a wall clock the arbiter of a verdict about
  // CONCURRENCY -- a stand-in for the observable rather than the observable itself, which is
  // what `audit-ambient-time-in-tests` refuses (it failed here on the unallowlisted timer).
  //
  // Counting occupancy answers the question DIRECTLY and deterministically: a reviewer bumps a
  // counter on entry, yields a fixed number of event-loop TURNS, and drops it on exit. If the
  // ferry runs them sequentially the counter can never exceed 1, however slow or fast the
  // machine is; if it runs them together the peak rises. The yield is a LITERAL-zero
  // `setTimeout`, which is deterministic in turns and is the one form the detector permits.
  //
  // This is also strictly stronger than the timestamp version: it cannot pass by accident on a
  // loaded runner where two sequential calls happen to straddle the same millisecond, and it
  // cannot fail on one where a concurrent pair is scheduled too far apart to overlap.
