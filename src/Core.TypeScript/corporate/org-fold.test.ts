/**
 * org-fold.test.ts — the organization rebuilt from its own event log.
 *
 * The centrepiece is the ROUND TRIP: run the real runtime, fold its own trace, and assert the
 * result equals the runtime's cascade and calendar node for node. That is what makes "the log is
 * sufficient to rebuild the organization" a checkable claim — a fold that reproduces something
 * simpler than what it folded is not a fold, it is a summary.
 *
 * It is also the test that fails when somebody adds a state-constituting emit and forgets its fact,
 * which is the failure mode this whole approach is exposed to.
