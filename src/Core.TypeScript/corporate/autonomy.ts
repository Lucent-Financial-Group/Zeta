/**
 * autonomy.ts — run the organization until it settles, and say WHY it stopped.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS MISSING ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * One invocation was one cycle. `run-agent.ts --resume` carried state between invocations, so a
 * human running it repeatedly was the loop. Autonomous completion needs the loop to exist in the
 * program, and the whole difficulty is that a loop which cannot stop is worse than no loop: it
 * burns a budget producing nothing and reports success by never admitting it finished.
 *
 * ── FOUR WAYS TO STOP, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS SUCCESS ───────────────────────
 *
 *   delivered      the goal is done. The only good ending.
 *   halted         an escalation stopped a task. The organization decided, and deciding to stop is
 *                  a real outcome — not a failure to try.
 *   no_progress    a cycle changed nothing measurable. The most important one: an organization
 *                  that keeps running and keeps producing the same state is not working, and the
 *                  loop that cannot see that is the one that spins forever.
 *   bound_reached  the cycle limit. A backstop, not a plan: reaching it means the other three
 *                  failed to fire, which is itself worth reporting.
 *
 * Every stop reason is REPORTED rather than collapsed into a boolean. "It stopped" and "it
 * finished" are the two sentences a driver must never confuse, and a caller that only learns
 * `delivered: false` cannot tell a blocked run from a budget that ran out.
 *
 * ── PROGRESS IS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED ────────────────────────────────────────
 * `progressOf` reduces a cycle to the numbers that must move for work to be happening: gates
 * crossed, work items done, changes landed. Two consecutive cycles with the same signature means
 * the organization is re-deciding the same things — which is exactly what a deterministic runtime
 * does when its inputs have not changed, so the detector is not a heuristic here, it is the honest
 * reading of a pure function called twice.
