/**
 * org-drive.ts — the organization running itself, one tick at a time.
 *
 * ── THE LOOP THIS CLOSES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   the organization's state
 *     -> a hat's surface (what has been asked of it, what it may do)
 *     -> its menu, from the observe grammar
 *     -> a choice
 *     -> an EFFECT the organization applies
 *     -> the organization's state
 *
 * Every arrow existed except the last. `org-observe-bridge` derives the surface and turns a choice
 * into an `OrgEffect`, and an effect is a DESCRIPTION — deliberately, so it can be inspected or
 * refused before anything moves. Nothing applied one, so the loop reached the organization's door
 * and stopped there.
 *
 * ── WHY APPLYING IS ITS OWN MODULE ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * Deriving what a choice MEANS and performing it are different responsibilities with different
 * failure modes: a derivation can be wrong about the organization, and an application can be
 * refused by it. Keeping them apart is what lets a caller run the whole loop in dry-run — deriving
 * every effect and applying none — which is the only honest way to ask "what would the organization
 * do next?" without it having done it.
 *
 * ── AND WHY PROGRESS IS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED ────────────────────────────────
 * A driver that keeps ticking while nothing changes is the failure `autonomy.ts` already names for
 * the delivery loop, one layer up: it burns a budget producing nothing and reports success by never
 * admitting it finished. So a drive reports what each tick DID, and a caller can see a tick that
 * chose something and changed nothing — which is a real and important outcome, not a bug to hide.
