/**
 * corporate/followup-commands.ts — the operator's commands behind the after-the-handoff seams.
 *
 * Four seams, each a COMMAND the operator supplies, for the same reason the handoff is one: how a
 * description is written, how a session decides about feedback, how a checkout is verified and how a
 * review system is read are the project's knowledge, not the register's.
 *
 *   describe   `<cmd> ... describe <workId>` in the change's checkout; prints the path of a markdown
 *              description on its first line. Told the sections in ORG_MR_SECTIONS.
 *   follow-up  `<cmd> ... follow-up <workId>` in the change's checkout; prints its decisions as a JSON
 *              object on its last line. Told the open items in ORG_ACTION_ITEMS.
 *   verify     the run's own `--work-verify`, re-run in the change's checkout after it moved.
 *   feedback   `<cmd> ...`, given the handed-off changes on stdin as JSON, prints deliveries as JSON
 *              lines. Plus a directory webhooks file deliveries into. Both are READS.
 *   answer     `<cmd> ...`, given one change's settled items on stdin, replies where each was raised
 *              and prints one result per item as a JSON line. The one seam that writes to the review
 *              system - and only what the organization already decided and recorded.
 *
 * Every spawn is `shell: false`, nothing untrusted reaches argv, and a command that fails is a
 * refusal carried back to the runtime - never a default that pretends it succeeded.

 * MEASURED on agentic-tpm, 2026-09-12: `--parallel 3` was set, the runtime queued both requests and
 * said "3 at a time" in its own record - and task-032's session began at 15:15:46, the second
 * task-040's ended. Perfectly serial. `ferry` was never at fault: it starts N ferries with
 * `Promise.all`, but the first one called a session through `spawnSync`, which BLOCKS THE ONLY
 * THREAD for as long as the session runs (21.6 min here). No other ferry can be scheduled while a
 * thread is blocked, so the degree-of-parallelism could never be anything but one.
 *
 * `ferry.test.ts` passed throughout, because it is given async work. The abstraction was right and
 * the port underneath it was synchronous - so the composition was the thing nobody tested.
 *
 * Returns exactly what `spawnSync` returns (`status`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `error`), so every caller
 * reads the result the same way it always did; only the awaiting changed.
