/**
 * git-data-source.test.ts — a repository that could not be read is not an empty repository.
 *
 * The disagreement with the pattern this borrows from is the load-bearing test here.
 * `agent-bus/subscribe.ts` ends its git call with `catch { return []; }`, which for a bus folder
 * that legitimately does not exist yet is defensible. For a data source it would make an
 * unreachable repository indistinguishable from one holding nothing — so an agent would groom
 * against silence while reporting it had consulted the source.
 *
 * These tests run against THIS repository, because a git adapter tested against a mock of git tests
 * the mock. The assertions are chosen to hold for any commit: counts and shapes, never contents.
