/**
 * corporate/org-event.ts — the organization's trace, as typed events rather than prose.
 *
 * ── THE GAP THIS CLOSES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `runOrgRuntime` reported what happened as `readonly string[]`. Readable, and unqueryable: nothing
 * could ask "every gate verdict on this work", "everything this hat decided", or — the one that
 * matters — "everything decided inside the CTO's line". A log you can only read is a log you can
 * only check by reading all of it, which nobody does.
 *
 * This is the reference's `OrgEvent` ported to the corporate register's own vocabulary
 * (`agentic-organization/packages/domain/src/org-event.ts`), reduced to the kinds this register
 * actually emits. Extending the enum with kinds nothing produces would recreate, in the audit trail,
 * exactly the modelled-but-unused problem this package was written to fix.
 *
 * ── THE SUPERVISOR CHAIN IS DERIVED, NEVER SUPPLIED ──────────────────────────
 * Every event carries the hat path from the root down to the actor, and `emit` computes it from the
 * chart. A caller cannot pass a chain, so a chain cannot be wrong — which is the whole reason to
 * record it. A supplied chain is an assertion about authority made by the same code that is claiming
 * the authority.
 *
 * That one field is what makes `decidedUnder` possible: an organization can ask what a line of
 * authority did without knowing in advance which hats are in it.

 * not resumed.
 *
 * Absent on events that decide nothing about state — a refusal, a signal, a churn notice. Those are
 * real events and they change no fact, and giving them an empty payload would blur the difference.
