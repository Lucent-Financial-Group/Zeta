/**
 * corporate/meeting-demand.ts — the conditions that put an hour in the diary.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE MODULE FROM `proposeMeetings` ─────────────────────
 * `proposeMeetings` decides what a meeting looks like given a condition. This decides whether the
 * condition HOLDS, and it is the half that can lie. Every field it produces is folded out of the
 * event log, the memory store, or the blocker outbox — never passed in by a caller who already
 * believes a meeting is needed. Split so the derivation can be falsified on its own: a test can
 * hand it a log with no rejections in it and require silence.
 *
 * ── THE FAILURE THIS IS BUILT AGAINST ────────────────────────────────────────
 * A standing meeting nobody can cancel. Everything here is CAUSED: when the rejections stop, when
 * the person answers, when the blocker is cleared, when the two memories are reconciled, the
 * condition stops being derivable and the meeting stops being proposed. Nothing recurs on a timer.

 * Memories two writers disagree about, and who the two writers are.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT A COMPARISON ACROSS SCOPES ───────────────────────────────
 * The first version of this compared values held at the same key by different scopes. A live run
 * booked eight meetings from it, and the meetings said what was wrong with it: hats disagreeing
 * about `the-part-of-this-repository-this-hat-touches` are not disagreeing at all — the scope is
 * part of the question, so two different answers are two correct answers. `memory.ts` is explicit
 * in the other direction: `crossScope.distinctScopes` is *"the promotion signal"*, so many scopes
 * observing one lesson is REINFORCEMENT. The detector was booking meetings about the system
 * working, which is the vacuity class with its sign flipped — a condition that fires when nothing
 * is wrong is as useless as one that never fires, and considerably more expensive.
 *
 * The genuine article already has a name. `write` sets `MemoryPhase.Conflicted` when a second
 * writer supplies a DIFFERENT value for the SAME (tier, scope, key) — one memory, two parties, an
 * actual disagreement. The value deliberately does not change on conflict, so the meeting is held
 * while the organisation still believes the older of the two things.
 *
 * The attendees come from the LOG rather than the memory, because a memory records who holds it
 * and not who contradicted it. Two distinct writers are required: a memory whose every write came
 * from one hat has nobody to put in the room, however conflicted it is.
