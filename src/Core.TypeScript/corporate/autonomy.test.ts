/**
 * autonomy.test.ts — the loop stops, and says why.
 *
 * A loop that cannot stop is worse than no loop: it burns a budget producing nothing and reports
 * success by never admitting it finished. So every stop reason is reached here by construction, and
 * the two that matter most are the ones a naive driver gets wrong —
 *
 *   no_progress   an organization re-deciding the same things is not working. A deterministic
 *                 runtime called twice on unchanged inputs produces an identical cycle, so this is
 *                 not a heuristic; it is the honest reading of a pure function called again.
 *   bound_reached the backstop. Reaching it means the other three failed to fire, which is itself
 *                 the finding — so it is reported rather than folded into "not delivered".
 *
 * The runtime is INJECTED, so these settle deterministically without standing up an organization.
