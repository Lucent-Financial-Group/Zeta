/**
 * pipeline.test.ts — produce, THEN judge, and the ordering that was the defect.
 *
 * The property everything else rests on: a gate is evaluated only after its own phase has made the
 * thing. Before this module the runtime evaluated all thirteen gates and then performed the work,
 * so `implementation_review` approved code that did not exist. The first test here is the one that
 * would have caught that, and it is written as an ORDER OF EVENTS rather than as a result — a
 * result-only assertion passes just as happily when the work happens afterwards.
