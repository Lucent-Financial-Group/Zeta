/**
 * corporate/agent-loop-bridge.ts — the organization DRIVING the canonical F# agent loop.
 *
 * ── THE COMPOSITION THE ADR MANDATES, IN THE OTHER DIRECTION ─────────────────
 * `loop-policy.ts` already composes this register onto the observe algebra. This does the same for
 * the other canonical loop: `WorkflowEngine.fs` and its port in `workflow-engine/agent-loop/`.
 * Direction is unchanged and non-negotiable — corporate imports the core, the core never imports
 * corporate (`register-boundary.test.ts`). An organization is one thing that can supply a status
 * surface and a candidate list; the loop does not know it exists.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS MISSING ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The agent loop is `(status_surface, current_state) → MenuOption[] → transition`. Nothing produced
 * a status surface. `StatusSnapshot` and `WorkCandidate` were types with no producer, so the loop
 * could be unit-tested and could not be RUN against anything real.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS DERIVED, AND WHAT HONESTLY IS NOT ────────────────────────────────
 * Every field is folded from what the organization recorded, or it is declared absent. The two
 * that cannot come from an org run take a caller-supplied function and default to NEUTRAL rather
 * than to a flattering number:
 *
 *   | field           | source                                                                |
 *   |-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
 *   | dora            | `deriveDora` — with its own `unmeasured` list carried through          |
 *   | contribution    | the priority class the organization DECIDED (not the recommendation)  |
 *   | uncertainty     | gate rejections + QA failures standing against the item               |
 *   | trajectoryPhase | the work's own state                                                  |
 *   | lane            | **caller** — the register has no lane taxonomy; default `mixed`, which is neither mandate |
 *   | agentInterest   | **caller** — nobody but the agent knows; default `0.5`, exactly neutral |
 *
 * Defaulting `agentInterest` to 0 would say every agent is uninterested in everything, and to 1
 * that it is keen on everything. Both are claims. `0.5` is the absence of one, and it matches how
 * `menu-generator` treats an unlisted trajectory: unknown stays unknown.
