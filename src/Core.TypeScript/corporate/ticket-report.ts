/**
 * corporate/ticket-report.ts — the ticket hears about the work, at the moments that are real progress.
 *
 * MEASURED on the Agentic Team, 2026-09-11..14: an organization ran for hours on AIAGENT-1658, 1659,
 * 1660-1662, decided an architecture, wrote an implementation, reproduced a defect, ran QA and opened
 * a merge request - and the Jira ticket said nothing the whole time. Every trace of that work lived
 * in the organization's own store and in GitLab. A person watching the tracker, which is where people
 * actually watch, could not tell the work from work nobody had started.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT IS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * When a gate the organization calls a MILESTONE passes, the ticket gets one short comment: what will
 * be done, what was done, where the work stands, and the merge request if one is open. Milestones are
 * named by the operator (`milestones`), never by this file - an organization whose gates are
 * architecture, implementation and QA says so; one with different gates says something else.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT IS NOT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Not a log of every verdict. MEASURED on the FlowDent store: 349 verdicts, 290 of them rejections
 * (83%), one gate rejecting a single item 81 times. A comment per verdict would bury the ticket in
 * the organization's own deliberation, which is what the review loop is FOR - it iterates until the
 * work comes back clean, and only the clean result is news to anybody outside. So a milestone reports
 * when it PASSES, once, and a turn-back stays inside the loop.
 *
 * ── WHICH TRACKER ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Whichever one the work came from. Intake mints `requestRef` as `<source>|<externalId>`, so a Jira
 * item reports to Jira and a Linear item to Linear with nothing configured; `tracker` overrides that
 * for an organization that reads from one place and reports to another. Nothing here speaks either
 * protocol: the posting is a command seam, exactly like opening a merge request.
