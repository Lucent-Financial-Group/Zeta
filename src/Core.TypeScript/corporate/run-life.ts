/**
 * corporate/run-life.ts — one tick of the organization's life, outside the pipeline.
 *
 * ── WHAT A TICK IS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The pipeline is what the organization does when it is asked. This is what it does the rest of the
 * time, and it is the difference between an org chart and an organization:
 *
 *   1. WHO IS IDLE — computed, not declared.
 *   2. HATS ON AND OFF — authority exists while there is work for it, and not otherwise.
 *   3. SELF-DIRECTED TIME — an idle hat studies something and WRITES DOWN what it learned.
 *   4. MEMORY MAINTENANCE — what was learned decays, and what is worthless is forgotten.
 *   5. MEETINGS — two hats put an hour in the diary because a CONDITION says they should.
 *
 * Every step emits a fact, so a person can ask "what was this organization doing at 4pm on a
 * Tuesday when nothing was in flight" and get an answer other than silence.
 *
 * ── THE STUDY IS PERFORMED BY A COMMAND, OR NOT AT ALL ───────────────────────
 * `study` is injected. Absent, hats are still marked idle and their blocks still appear — but no
 * memory is written, and the tick reports that it studied nothing. An organization that reported
 * learning without a learner would be the exact unfalsifiable claim `org-life.ts` is built against.
