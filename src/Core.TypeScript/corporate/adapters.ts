/**
 * corporate/adapters.ts — the concrete ends of the ports.
 *
 * ── TWO FAMILIES, AND THE LABEL IS THE WHOLE POINT ───────────────────────────
 * The `simulated*` adapters are what the register did all along: an inbound fixture, a work item
 * that completes by being marked complete, planned test outcomes, a change that merges because
 * nothing stopped it. Nothing about that behaviour changes here. What changes is that it now SAYS
 * it is a simulation, so a report can tell a run that shipped something from a run that decided it
 * had.
 *
 * The `real*` adapters actually reach: a directory of inbound events, a shell command whose exit
 * code decides the outcome, a git branch and merge. They are constructed explicitly and are never a
 * default — see `providers.ts` on why `resolve` refuses rather than falling back.
 *
 * ── THE COMMAND ADAPTER IS A REAL CAPABILITY ─────────────────────────────────
 * `commandWorkExecutor` runs a process. That is the point — it is how an organization builds
 * anything — and it is also the sharpest edge in this file, so:
 *
 *   - the command is supplied by the CALLER. There is no default command, no shell string
 *     interpolation of work titles, and no way for a work item's content to become the command.
 *   - arguments are passed as an ARRAY, never a shell line, so nothing in a work item can inject a
 *     second command.
 *   - the exit code decides success. Not stdout, not the absence of stderr — a build that prints
 *     "error" and exits 0 succeeded, and one that prints nothing and exits 1 did not.
 *   - stdout and stderr are captured as evidence, truncated, and the truncation is visible.
 *
 * ── EVERY ADAPTER RETURNS A RESULT ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * A provider that throws takes the organization down with it; one that swallows its error reports
 * success it did not have. Both are refusals here, with the reason carried out.
