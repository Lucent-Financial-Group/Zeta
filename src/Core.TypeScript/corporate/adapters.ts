/**
 * corporate/adapters.ts — the concrete ends of the ports.
 *
 * ── TWO FAMILIES, AND THE LABEL IS THE WHOLE POINT ───────────────────────────
 * The `simulated*` adapters are what the register did all along: an inbound fixture, a work item
 * that completes by being marked complete, planned test outcomes, a change that merges because
 * nothing stopped it. Nothing about that behaviour changes here. What changes is that it now SAYS
 * it is a simulation, so a report can tell a run that shipped something from a run that decided it
 * had.
 *
 * The `real*` adapters actually reach: a directory of inbound events, a shell command whose exit
 * code decides the outcome, a git branch and merge. They are constructed explicitly and are never a
 * default — see `providers.ts` on why `resolve` refuses rather than falling back.
 *
 * ── THE COMMAND ADAPTER IS A REAL CAPABILITY ─────────────────────────────────
 * `commandWorkExecutor` runs a process. That is the point — it is how an organization builds
 * anything — and it is also the sharpest edge in this file, so:
 *
 *   - the command is supplied by the CALLER. There is no default command, no shell string
 *     interpolation of work titles, and no way for a work item's content to become the command.
 *   - arguments are passed as an ARRAY, never a shell line, so nothing in a work item can inject a
 *     second command.
 *   - the exit code decides success. Not stdout, not the absence of stderr — a build that prints
 *     "error" and exits 0 succeeded, and one that prints nothing and exits 1 did not.
 *   - stdout and stderr are captured as evidence, truncated, and the truncation is visible.
 *
 * ── EVERY ADAPTER RETURNS A RESULT ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * A provider that throws takes the organization down with it; one that swallows its error reports
 * success it did not have. Both are refusals here, with the reason carried out.

 * same codes — `ETIMEDOUT` when `timeoutMs` passes (the child is killed), `ENOBUFS` when output
 * passes `maxBuffer` (killed), the spawn error when it could not start. Callers that read

 * Changes as real git branches, each in ITS OWN WORKTREE.

 * files are on disk. Today's runtime is sequential so nothing breaks — but "nothing breaks because
 * nobody has tried it concurrently yet" is a property held by an accident of the caller rather
 * than by the adapter, and that is the kind of limit that stops being true silently.
 *
 * A worktree gives each change its own directory and its own HEAD. The shared repository's checked
 * out branch never moves, so `open` is safe to call while another change is still in flight.
 *
 * `merge` merges into the BASE BRANCH, named — never into `HEAD`. That distinction is the whole
 * bug this paragraph used to describe incorrectly: `git merge <branch>` merges into whatever is
 * checked out, and the property above guarantees that is NOT the base. Measured against a clone
 * sitting on a feature branch: the change branched from `main`, and the merge landed on the
 * feature branch while `main` never moved. The run called it delivered.
 *
 * So the base is merged in a worktree of its own when the shared checkout is somewhere else, and
 * in place when it is already there. Either way the operator's own HEAD and working tree are
 * exactly where they were left.
 *
 * `--no-ff`, for the same reason as the sibling adapter: a fast-forward leaves no record that a
 * change existed. Removal is part of merging rather than a separate cleanup step, because a
 * worktree left behind holds a lock on its branch and the next run's `open` would refuse.
