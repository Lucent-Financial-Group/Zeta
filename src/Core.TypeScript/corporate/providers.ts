/**
 * corporate/providers.ts — the ports where the organization touches reality.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS SIMULATED, AND WHY IT LOOKED REAL ───────────────────────────────
 * The register orchestrates faithfully and performs nothing. "Implementation" moved a state to
 * `done`; QA outcomes came from a configured fallback; gate verdicts were computed rather than
 * earned; the inbound event was a hardcoded fixture. None of that is wrong — a simulation is a
 * legitimate thing to have — but it was INDISTINGUISHABLE from the real thing at every call site,
 * which is the failure `.claude/rules/toy-is-free-metered-must-be-earned.md` names: unlabelled work
 * reads as real by default.
 *
 * So this is not "add the real implementations". It is: make the boundary a declared, typed,
 * labelled seam, so a real adapter can be dropped in AND so a run can say which of its capabilities
 * actually touched anything.
 *
 * ── FIDELITY IS THE POINT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every provider declares whether it is `simulated` or `real`, and a `ProviderSet` derives one
 * consequence from that: **a run that used a real provider is not DST-replayable.** `qa.ts` already
 * had a `TestExecutor` port and no way to say whether it had run anything, so a suite of planned
 * outcomes and a suite of executed ones produced identical-looking reports. `replayable` is the
 * difference, computed rather than asserted.
 *
 * ── AN UNREGISTERED PORT REFUSES; IT NEVER FALLS BACK ────────────────────────
 * The single most dangerous thing this layer could do is silently substitute a simulated provider
 * when a real one was asked for and not found. A run would then report work it never did. So
 * `resolve` REFUSES, and choosing the simulated adapter is something a caller does on purpose and
 * can be seen doing.
 *
 * ── NONINTERFERENCE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * §13: entropy and influence cross only through declared, metered channels. A provider IS that
 * channel — the only place the register reaches a filesystem, a network, or a shell. Everything
 * else stays pure, so the parts that are not providers remain replayable whatever the providers do.
 *
 * ── NO CLASSES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `.claude/rules/interfaces-free-classes-earned-under-rules.md`: interfaces are free, a class must
 * be earned. A registry is a value and its operations are functions over that value — nothing here
 * needs instance state, so nothing here has any.

/**
 * What a run COULD do, and what it actually DID — kept apart, because they are different claims.
 *
 * `fidelityOf` reads the ProviderSet's LABELS. That is the right basis for `replayable`: a set
 * holding a real adapter cannot be promised to replay, whether or not this particular run happened
 * to reach it, and answering otherwise would be a promise the next run breaks.
 *
 * It is the wrong basis for the sentence a human reads. The register wrote *"these port(s) touched
 * something real: review"* over a run with **zero gate evaluations** — measured — because the
 * reviewer was configured, not called. "Touched" is a claim about the world; configuration is a
 * claim about intent, and a disclosure that conflates them overstates in the one direction this
 * whole layer exists to prevent.
 *
 * So a run reports THREE things rather than two:
 *
 *   - `reached`             real AND called. The only set "touched something" can honestly name.
 *   - `configuredNotCalled` real and never called. Not nothing, and not a reach — its own answer.
 *   - `replayable`          configuration-derived, unchanged, deliberately conservative.
 *
 * Both new fields are DERIVED from `realPorts` and the invocation set. Neither can be declared.
