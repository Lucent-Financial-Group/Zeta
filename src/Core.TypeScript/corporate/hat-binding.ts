/**
 * corporate/hat-binding.ts — wearing a hat is TEMPORAL. It warms up, it is active, it expires.
 *
 * ── THE GAP THIS CLOSES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Until now a hat in this register was a permanent property of an agent: `bindHatToLoop` handed out
 * the authority of a level to anyone who named the hat, forever. So the RMO's whole job — deciding
 * who wears what, and for how long — had no object to act on, and "revoke this agent's authority"
 * was not expressible.
 *
 * A binding is that object. It has a lifetime, and the AUTHORITY IS THE BINDING'S, not the hat's:
 *
 *   Pending ──approve──▶ Warmup ──(warmupEndsAt)──▶ Active ──(expiresAt)──▶ Expired
 *                          │                          │
 *                          └──────release / revoke────┴──▶ Released / Revoked
 *
 * Only `Active` authorizes. That single rule is what makes the lifecycle load-bearing rather than
 * bookkeeping — see `activeAuthorityFor`, and `loop-policy.ts`, which will not bind a hat to the
 * loop without one.
 *
 * ── TIME IS MILLISECONDS, NOT ISO STRINGS ────────────────────────────────────
 * The reference stores `boundAt` / `expiresAt` as ISO strings and `Date.parse`s them back on every
 * advance. That round-trip has a quiet failure: a malformed or absent string parses to `NaN`, and
 * `nowMs >= NaN` is **false** — so the binding never expires and the authority is permanent, which
 * is the exact opposite of what the field was added to guarantee. Numbers here, validated at
 * construction, so an unusable timestamp is refused rather than silently granting forever.
 *
 * Same reason no function here reads a clock: `nowMs` is an argument, because a binding's validity
 * is shared evidence and must not depend on which machine asked
 * (`.claude/rules/local-time-never-enters-the-shared-fold.md`).
