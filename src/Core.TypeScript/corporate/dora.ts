/**
 * corporate/dora.ts — the four DORA metrics, folded from what the organization actually did.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `WorkflowEngine.fs` carries `DoraMetrics` as the status surface the whole agent loop is steered
 * by — the README calls it the *"DORA mandate — menu generator weights options by DORA
 * contribution"*. The corporate register produced runs, queues, gate verdicts and QA cycles and
 * computed none of it, so the menu had nothing to weigh.
 *
 * ── THE HONEST PART, AND IT IS THE POINT ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Two of the five fields CANNOT be computed from an org run as it stands, and the tempting move is
 * to return `0` for them and hand back a struct that looks fully measured.
 * `.claude/rules/toy-is-free-metered-must-be-earned.md` names that exactly: unlabelled work reads
 * as `metered` by default, and a zero is indistinguishable from a measurement of zero.
 *
 * So the derivation returns BOTH the metrics and the list of fields it could not measure, with the
 * reason. `isFullyMeasured` is the one-line question, and `metrics` alone is never the whole answer.
 * A caller that ignores `unmeasured` is making a claim the data does not support, and now that is a
 * thing it had to choose to do rather than a thing it fell into.
 *
 *   | field                 | measured? | from                                                |
 *   |-----------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
 *   | deploymentCount       | yes       | shards that reached `Merged`                        |
 *   | leadTimeMedianSeconds | yes       | claim → completion, per claim                       |
 *   | changeFailureRate     | yes       | delivered work that failed QA or bounced a gate     |
 *   | mttrMedianSeconds     | **no**    | nothing records an incident, so nothing records its restore |
 *   | substrateRatio        | **no**    | the register has no lane taxonomy; `Lane` is a core type the org never assigns |
 *
 * ── MEDIAN, NOT MEAN ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * DORA's lead time and MTTR are medians in the original research (Forsgren, Humble & Kim,
 * *Accelerate*, 2018), and the difference is not pedantry: one item that sat in the queue over a
 * weekend moves a mean and does not move a median, so a mean would report a delivery problem the
 * organization does not have.
 *
 * Time arrives as `nowMs` and per-record timestamps — never read here, per
 * `.claude/rules/local-time-never-enters-the-shared-fold.md`.
