/**
 * corporate/supervisor-signal.ts — how a hat talks UPWARD, and why it is not a chat box.
 *
 * ── THE GAP THIS CLOSES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The canonical package had no upward path at all. An agent that hit a blocker had nowhere to put
 * it: the observe grammar can `respond_to_operator` (one channel, to the human) and the agent bus
 * can address a peer, but there was no notion of *the hat that supervises this duty* and therefore
 * no way to route a question, a blocker, or a resource request to it.
 *
 * `SUPERVISOR_CHAIN_COMMUNICATION.md` states the requirement exactly:
 *
 *   > Agents should never have to guess how to talk upward in the Organization.
 *
 * and gives the chain — team member → manager → director → C-suite → executive board — plus eight
 * typed tool families. Typed, not free-text, and the doc is explicit about why:
 *
 *   > Hats expose upward communication tools as typed tools, not as a generic chat box.
 *
 * ── WHAT MAKES A TYPED TOOL DIFFERENT FROM A MESSAGE ─────────────────────────
 * Two things, both enforced here:
 *
 *   1. **Routing is derived, never chosen.** The sender names the *tool*, not the recipient. Where
 *      it goes falls out of the hat graph. A sender who picks the recipient can route around a
 *      supervisor that would have said no, and can address a hat that has no authority over the
 *      question — both of which turn the chain into an address book.
 *
 *   2. **Evidence is required per family** (*"what evidence is required"* is one of the six things
 *      the doc says a hat's brief must answer). A blocker with no trace is an assertion that work
 *      is stuck; a blocker with one is a thing the supervisor can triage without re-deriving it.
 *
 * ── AND IT PRODUCES AN ARTIFACT ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every signal opens a `supervisor_signal` discussion anchor with both hats as participants, so the
 * reply, the triage, and the eventual decision live on the artifact rather than in a transcript.
 * That is the third question this register had no answer to: agents here now communicate through
 * anchored artifacts, exactly as the corporate register does.
