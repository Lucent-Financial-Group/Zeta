/**
 * observe-cli.ts — an agent's worldview, served as a command it can run.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every agent this organization runs used to be HANDED its context: a gate name, a work id, a list of
 * paths, a brief copied into its environment. Each adapter chose what the agent got, so what an agent
 * knew depended on which adapter happened to invoke it — and an agent could never look at anything
 * it was not given. The Agentic Team's first real run found the consequence four times over: the
 * fixer never saw the reproduction, the BRD author never saw the grooming, the reviewer saw nothing.
 *
 * This inverts it. An agent is told WHO it is and that `observe` is its worldview, and it asks:
 *
 *   dashboard                  what I hold, what is waiting on me, what matters, what I could do
 *   item <workId>              one work item: description, steps, attachments, comments, links
 *   attachment <workId> <ref>  one thing left on that item, printed
 *   menu                       every action open to me, not only the first twelve
 *
 * The World it serves is built by the same bridge the organization's own driver uses
 * (`orgSurfaceFor`), plus the item record (`ItemContext`) folded from the log. Read-only: nothing
 * here writes, so an agent may run it as often as it likes, including in the middle of a run —
 * events are appended as they happen, so what it sees is what the organization has recorded so far.
 *
 * usage: bun observe-cli.ts --store <dir> --hat <hatId> [--actions <dir>] [--json] <command> [...]
