/**
 * corporate/change-request.ts — how this organization puts a finished change in front of people.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS CONFIGURATION, AND WHY IT IS REQUIRED ────────────────────────
 * An organization whose delivery is `human_review` ends every piece of work as a merge request, and
 * three things about that request are the operator's to decide, never the register's:
 *
 *   - WHAT IT SAYS. The first three requests this organization opened described themselves as a
 *     list of gate verdicts; the operator wanted the problem, whether it reproduced (and if not what
 *     gave it away), the root cause, the resolution and how the fix was confirmed. Nobody can guess a
 *     team's review conventions, so the SECTIONS are data: a heading and what it must state.
 *   - WHAT IT MUST NOT CARRY. The organization's evidence (screenshots, step documents) belongs to
 *     the organization. MEASURED on those same requests: a committed UAT screenshot and a committed
 *     step document. `keepOut` names what a change may never add, and the handoff refuses one that does.
 *   - HOW IT STAYS CURRENT. A request that falls behind its target is work waiting on somebody.
 *     Whether the organization brings it up to date, and how, rewrites a branch people are reviewing —
 *     so it is chosen, never assumed.
 *   - HOW IT ANSWERS. A reviewer who comments is owed an answer where they asked: what was changed
 *     and in which commit, or why nothing was. Whether the organization replies, and whether it also
 *     resolves the thread, speaks in the operator's name on somebody else's conversation — chosen.
 *
 * Required for exactly the organizations that hand work to people: `org configure` asks it, and a run
 * that would open a request without it is refused before it starts, rather than hours later when the
 * first change finishes.
 *
 * ── THE GRAMMAR HOLDS NO OPINION ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * No section names live here. `validateChangeRequests` checks that a configuration can mean what it
 * says; `missingSections` checks a description against whatever was configured. What a good merge
 * request contains is the organization's statement, in its own words.

 * finished with it. A person merging reads a red pipeline, not the argument for why it does not
 * count. So `until_green` says: a diagnosis is not a resolution. While the head pipeline is not
