/**
 * corporate/change-control.ts — the register's work becoming a real CHANGE.
 *
 * ── THE GAP THIS CLOSES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The corporate register could staff, schedule, verify and gate a task, and the outcome stayed
 * inside itself. `work-market` merges a shard into its own queue; `goal-cascade` marks a node done.
 * Neither produces a branch, a pull request, or a review — so "delivered" meant delivered *to the
 * organization's own bookkeeping*.
 *
 * The canonical package already models the real thing. `workflow-engine/agent-loop/
 * work-lifecycle-state-machine.ts` carries an eleven-state lifecycle —
 *
 *     Backlog → Claimed → InProgress → PrOpen → InReview
 *                                                 ↕ (RevisionRequested ↔ RevisionPushed)
 *                                              Approved → Merged | Closed | Abandoned
 *
 * — and it is the TS twin of `src/Core/WorkflowEngine.fs`, so the vocabulary is treaty-locked across
 * languages rather than invented here.
 *
 * ── THE PROJECTION IS DERIVED, NEVER SET ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Every transition below is driven by something the organization ALREADY decided: the cascade
 * assigned the task, the loop picked it, the market completed the shard, a gate approved or turned
 * it back. Nothing here chooses to advance.
 *
 * That is the whole discipline of change control. Two records that can be updated independently
 * drift, and the drift is silent in the direction that matters — an organization reporting a merge
 * with no PR, or a PR nobody's gates ever saw. `disagreementsWith` is the check that they have not.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS IS NOT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It does not talk to a forge. The canonical package has `forge-host/` for that, and a projection
 * that also performed the network call could not be replayed. This produces the STATE a forge
 * adapter would act on, and `run-org.ts` prints it; wiring it to a live PR is the adapter's job and
 * a separate decision, because opening pull requests is not something a test suite should do.
