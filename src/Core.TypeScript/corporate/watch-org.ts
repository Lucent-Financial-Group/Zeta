/**
 * corporate/watch-org.ts — the organization, watching its own merge requests.
 *
 * MEASURED on the Agentic Team, 2026-09-11: every step after a merge request opened (reading its
 * comments, deciding, fixing, answering) ran only because a person started run-org again. A run stops
 * once its work is handed to people, and nothing read the request until the next one. So comments
 * waited on nobody, and the after-the-handoff loop was real only while someone was at the keyboard.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT DOES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * For each of an organization's RUN PROFILES (`run-profile.ts`), on the profile's interval, it asks
 * one question - IS THERE ANYTHING NEW THE ORGANIZATION HAS NOT SEEN? - and starts that profile's run
 * only if there is:
 *   - feedback on a handed-off request it has not raised yet (a comment, the pipeline failing, the
 *     target moving), read by the profile's own poller, or filed by a webhook into its feedback dir;
 *   - a settled item still owed an answer, or one whose answer was withheld;
 *   - an item raised and never decided;
 *   - an after-open step not yet done on a request (e.g. the `aireview` comment).
 * It decides nothing about the work. The run decides; this only notices that there is a run to have.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT WILL NOT DO ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Start a run while one holds the store (`store-lock.ts`, which also covers a run a person started).
 * Start the same run for the same reasons over and over: an unchanged set of reasons is retried only
 * every RETRY_EVERY intervals, so a follow-up that keeps failing costs one attempt an hour, not twelve.
 * Let a run go on forever: past its profile's maxRunMinutes it is stopped - by PID, with its tree,
 * never by name.
