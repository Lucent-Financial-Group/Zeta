 * A child that simply STAYS ALIVE, with no wall-clock in it.
 *
 * These tests assert on a live process's EXISTENCE — who holds the run lock, that a
 * second run is refused — and never wait for it to finish. The child used to be
 * a one-minute timer, which reads to `audit-ambient-time-in-tests.ts` as a
 * 60-second wall-clock dependency and failed the gate. It was not one: nothing awaited
 * that timer. (Stated without writing the call out: this guard greps TEXT, so a comment
 * quoting the pattern is itself a finding — which is how this comment first failed it.)
 *
 * A listening socket is a real libuv handle, so the event loop stays open for exactly
 * as long as the parent lets it, and there is no duration anywhere to be load-sensitive
 * about. Loopback so no local firewall has an opinion; port 0 so nothing collides.
 * Fixing the idiom rather than allowlisting it: an allowlist row would have recorded a
 * wall-clock dependency that does not exist.
