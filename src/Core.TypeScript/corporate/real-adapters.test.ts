/**
 * real-adapters.test.ts — the same organization, against a real repository.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM `end-to-end.test.ts` ────────────────
 * That file runs the whole organization over SIMULATED ports and says so about itself: every
 * assertion there is evidence about the organization's wiring, and none of it is evidence that any
 * work was performed. The distinction is the one this register is built around, and a suite that
 * blurred it would be the vacuity class at the top of the stack — a green end-to-end file cited
 * later as proof of something it never measured.
 *
 * So this file does the other half. A real `git init` in a temp directory, a real inbox on disk, a
 * real command as the work executor, real change control — and the assertion is on the REPOSITORY,
 * read back with `git log` after the run. Not the report's opinion of what it did.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT PINS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * That the real path still works. It is the path that rots: every change in this register is made
 * and verified against simulated adapters, because they are fast and deterministic, and the run
 * that touches a repository is the one nobody re-runs. This test is that re-run.
