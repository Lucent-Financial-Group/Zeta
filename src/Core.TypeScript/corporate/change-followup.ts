/**
 * corporate/change-followup.ts — what happens to a change after it is in front of people.
 *
 * ── THE ORGANIZATION'S PART DOES NOT END AT THE HANDOFF ──────────────────────
 * A merge request is a conversation. Reviewers comment, the request is updated or closed, and the
 * branch it targets moves on without it. Every one of those is something somebody may need to act
 * on, and until this existed the organization handed a change off and never looked at it again.
 *
 * ── AN EVENT IS AN ACTION ITEM, NEVER AN INSTRUCTION ─────────────────────────
 * Whatever arrives — a webhook delivery, a poll of the review system — is recorded as an ACTION ITEM
 * on the work it concerns (`action_item_raised`), and that is all. No event re-runs a gate, reopens a
 * step or starts work by itself: a comment that says "this is fine" and one that says "this breaks
 * checkout" arrive the same way, and telling them apart is judgement. The organization weighs its
 * open items against everything else it has to do and decides, per item, to address it, decline it
 * with a reason, or leave it for later. That decision is an agent's; this module only carries the
 * items to it and checks the answer names items that exist.
 *
 * ── NOTHING HERE KNOWS A REVIEW SYSTEM ───────────────────────────────────────
 * A delivery says which change it is about (a branch, or a review address) or which target moved.
 * How a GitLab note or a GitHub review becomes one is the source's business — a webhook mapping or a
 * poller — so the register can learn another review system without a line changing here.
