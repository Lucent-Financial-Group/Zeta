/**
 * corporate/run-org.ts — the production entry point. One organizational cycle, end to end.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `runOrgRuntime`, `buildOrgChart` and `SEED_HATS` were reachable only from tests. An entry point
 * nothing outside a test suite invokes is a library nobody has shipped, and "it runs end to end" is
 * a claim about a code path nothing in production takes.
 *
 * This is that path. It builds the seeded organization, feeds it external reports, runs the whole
 * pipeline, and prints what happened and how the organization stands afterwards.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/corporate/run-org.ts
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/corporate/run-org.ts --qa-fails       (QA rejects; nothing delivers)
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/corporate/run-org.ts --churn          (repeated failure → escalation)
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/corporate/run-org.ts --json           (the full report, for a pipe)
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/corporate/run-org.ts --week           (the organization running ITSELF)
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/corporate/run-org.ts --week --days 30 (…for longer)
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/corporate/run-org.ts --cycle          (one SCRIPTED story; see org-cycle.ts)
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/corporate/run-org.ts --admin          (also exercise the operator surface)
 *
 * By default every port is SIMULATED, and the run says so. To make one of them real:
 *   --inbox <dir>      read inbound events from a directory of JSON files
 *   --work-cmd <exe> [--work-arg <a> ...]   perform each work item as <exe> <a...> <workId>
 *   --test-cmd <exe> [--test-arg <a> ...]   run each test case as <exe> <a...> <testCaseId>
 *   --git <dir> [--base <branch>]   open and merge real branches in <dir>
 *   --worktrees <dir>               give every change its own checkout under <dir> (concurrency-safe)
 *   --review-queue <dir>            gates decided by verdicts filed under <dir>/<workId>/<gate>.json
 *   --review-cmd <exe> [--review-arg <a> ...]   gates decided by <exe> <a...> <gate> <workId>
 *   --review-model <model>          gates judged by a local model; an unclear answer is REFUSED
 *   --tracker <url> [--tracker-items <path>] [--tracker-map <field>=<path> ...]
 *                                   [--tracker-header <k:v> ...] [--tracker-source <name>]
 *                                   inbound work fetched from a real tracker, e.g. for Jira:
 *                                     --tracker-items issues --tracker-map externalId=key
 *                                     --tracker-map title=fields.summary
 *   --work-agent <exe> --work-verify <exe>   an agent performs each item and a DIFFERENT command
 *                                   decides whether it worked; the agent never votes on itself
 *
 * Any of these makes the run UNREPLAYABLE, which the fidelity block prints without being asked.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 delivered · 1 not delivered · 2 the organization could not be built.

 * The goals a person actually stated, as intake.
 *
 * ── THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `org goal --title ... --reason ...` validated the request through `acceptAction`, appended it to
 * the queue, AND recorded a permanent event for it — then nothing ever read it. Grepping the queue's
 * consumers found three: an agent's inbox view, gate approve/reject answers, and blocker
 * acceptance. `SubmitGoal` had NO consumer at all. So the run always built the hardcoded `REPORTS`
 * fixture instead.
 *
 * MEASURED, end to end: an organization was created, told to "Ship a URL shortener HTTP API", and
 * reported `queued submit_goal`. The run that followed decomposed, staffed, reviewed, gated and
 * merged — all of it correctly — for 'checkout double-charges when a coupon is applied twice'. The
 * customer's goal was never mentioned once. Every part worked; they were not connected.
 *
 * That is a WRITER WITH NO READER — the mirror of the reader-with-no-writer pattern this codebase
 * keeps producing, and harder to see, because the writing end reports success.
 *
 * The fixture is kept as the FALLBACK, not the default: an org with nothing queued still has
 * something to demonstrate, and a run says which of the two it used rather than leaving a person to
 * infer it from the work item titles.

 * `org create` records an organization's store, its intake mode, its AUTONOMY, its human
 * checkpoints and its skill bindings — and `run-org` read NONE of it. There was no `--org` flag at
 * all: every setting had to be retyped as a flag on every run, and any that was not retyped simply
 * did not apply. An organization created `--autonomy autonomous --checkpoint cost_approval` ran
 * fully agentic, in whatever store the command line happened to name, because nothing connected the
 * configuration surface to the runtime. Configuration that the thing being configured never reads
 * is not configuration; it is a note to nobody.
 *
 * ── AUTONOMY DECIDES WHETHER THE RUN CONVERGES ───────────────────────────────
 * The autonomy loop existed (`runUntilSettled`, with the right stop reasons) but was opt-in behind
 * `--until N`, so the default was a SINGLE cycle. That is the wrong default for an organization: an
 * org that stops after one pass with work still open has not finished, and a person watching it
 * cannot tell "it is done" from "it stopped". An organization runs until the work is delivered,
 * until it is genuinely blocked, or until it stops making progress — and then says which.
 *
 * So a resolved org CONVERGES by default, and `--until` becomes the bound rather than the switch.
 * An explicit flag always wins: this fills in what the command line left unsaid, and overrides
 * nothing.
