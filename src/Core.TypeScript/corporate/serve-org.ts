 * `/api/view` returns `viewOf(...)` — the *identical* function the terminal view calls. The page
 * holds no state and computes nothing: every number on screen came off one fold of the event log.
 * Two renderers over one fold cannot disagree; two renderers over two queries eventually do, and
 * then nobody can say which one is lying.
 *
 * ── READ ONLY, BY CONSTRUCTION ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * There is no POST, no PUT, no DELETE, and no path that writes. A dashboard that can change what it
 * observes is not a dashboard. This also means it is safe to point at a live run: the worst it can
 * do is read a half-written log, which the fold handles because it is order-independent.
 *
 * Bound to LOOPBACK unless `--host` says otherwise: an organization's internal state is not
 * something to put on a network by default.
