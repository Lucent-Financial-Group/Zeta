/**
 * corporate/branch-topology.ts — what a change is CALLED and what it branches FROM.
 *
 * ── THE STATE THIS REPLACES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every change was `work/<workId>`, branched from one fixed trunk, merged back to that same trunk.
 * Three things were wrong with that and only the first is cosmetic:
 *
 *   - `work/task-015` names an id this organization minted for itself. Nobody outside it can tell
 *     what that branch holds, and the ticket the work answers was already on the node.
 *   - Every change branched from the trunk, so a feature built out of six stories arrived as six
 *     unrelated merges and there was never a point at which the FEATURE could be reviewed.
 *   - A one-line defect fix got exactly the same treatment as that feature, which is the opposite
 *     mistake: ceremony bought for nothing.
 *
 * ── WHY THE SHAPE DECIDES, AND NOT A WORK TYPE ───────────────────────────────
 * The obvious rule is "a project gets a feature branch". It is wrong here, and measurably so: the
 * decomposition gives EVERY inbound request a full `goal -> initiative -> project -> leaf` chain, so
 * a single defect arrives owning a project of its own. Keyed on the type, a one-line fix would get
 * an integration branch, a merge into it, and a second merge out of it, to carry one commit.
 *
 * So the question is not what a rung is CALLED but whether it actually COLLECTS:
 *
 *   > An ancestor earns an integration branch when two or more code-producing items sit under it.
 *
 * That is read off the cascade, needs no configuration, and produces exactly the two cases worth
 * distinguishing — a feature branch with its stories merging into it, and a lone defect going
 * straight to the trunk — without anyone declaring which is which.
 *
 * ── ONE LEVEL, AND THE FIRST CUT GOT THIS WRONG ──────────────────────────────
 * The NEAREST collecting ancestor takes the branch; the ones above it take none. The first
 * version stacked all of them, reasoning that nesting should fall out of the same rule rather
 * than being a second one. It does fall out — and what falls out is absurd. Decomposition gives
 * every request a goal, an initiative AND a project, so a two-story request has three ancestors
 * each holding the same two code items, and each earned a branch: three integration branches and
 * six extra merges to deliver two commits.
 *
 * The generalisation was not more general, it was just uncounted. Stories merge into the feature;
 * the feature merges into the trunk. Where a project holds only one story, the nearest COLLECTING
 * ancestor is the initiative above it, so sibling one-story projects share the epic's branch —
 * which is the nesting case handled, by the same single rule, without a stack.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS DATA, AND WHAT IS NOT ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The register may have an opinion about how its own branches are NAMED; the grammar may not have
 * an opinion about anything. So the prefixes below are data with defaults, in the same place and
 * the same style as the method defaults. The RULE above is not data, because it is not a
 * preference — it is a measurement of the work.

/**
 * A work item's branch name, resolved against the rest of the cascade.
 *
 * ── WHY THE CASCADE IS NEEDED, AND WHAT THE FIRST TWO ATTEMPTS GOT WRONG ─────
 * `requestRef` is INHERITED by children on purpose — a task under a project under a goal that
 * answers a request answers that request — so in a real decomposition every rung carries the same
 * ticket. Measured on the folded cascade of a real end-to-end run:
 *
 *     goal-009  epic/T-1      init-011  epic/T-1      proj-013  feature/T-1
 *     task-015  defect/T-1    task-017  review/T-1
 *
 * `epic/T-1` twice. Differing prefixes hid the rest, because that fixture's two leaves happen to be
 * a defect and a review — two TASKS under one project, which is the feature case this whole module
 * exists for, would both be `story/T-1`.
 *
 * ATTEMPT ONE named every rung after the ticket. Collides.
 * ATTEMPT TWO used the ticket only when the ref was the node's OWN rather than its parent's. Correct
 * about inheritance, and the wrong rule: it demoted the commonest case there is — a request that
 * becomes ONE code item — to `defect/do-leaf-1`, discarding the single most useful thing a branch
 * name carries, to avoid a collision that was not there.
 *
 * So the collision is measured, not predicted. Keep the ticket unless another node would produce the
 * same name; fall back to the description, and to the id under that.
 *
 * ── STABILITY, AND ITS HONEST LIMIT ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * The answer depends on which nodes exist, so a node gaining a same-named peer changes its name. In
 * practice a decomposition creates a parent's children together, so this settles before any branch
 * is opened. When it does not, the change port's owner check REFUSES rather than writing one item's
 * work under another's name — visible and safe, but a refusal rather than a rename, and worth
 * knowing about before it is met.
