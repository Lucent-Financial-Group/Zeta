/**
 * corporate/org-registry.ts — many organizations, each with its own sources and disposition.
 *
 * ── WHY A REGISTRY AND NOT A `--store` FLAG ──────────────────────────────────
 * An organization was a directory passed on the command line. That is enough to RUN one and not
 * enough to HAVE several: nothing recorded which Jira project an org reads, whether it may raise its
 * own work, or how it verifies — so every invocation had to restate all of it, and two orgs on one
 * machine differed only by whichever flags the caller last typed.
 *
 * This is the record. `org create` writes one, every other command reads it, and the AI driving the
 * CLI names an org instead of reassembling its configuration each time.
 *
 * ── CREDENTIALS ARE PATHS, NEVER VALUES ──────────────────────────────────────
 * A source carries `authFile` — WHERE the token is read from at call time — and never the token.
 * The registry is a JSON file on disk and the CLI's arguments show up in process listings, so a
 * secret in either is a secret published to every process on the machine. `validateOrg` REFUSES a
 * config whose `authFile` looks like a credential rather than a path, because the failure is
 * otherwise silent and permanent: nobody notices a working token in a config file.
 *
 * ── SOURCES ARE READ-ONLY, AND THAT IS STRUCTURAL ────────────────────────────
 * `DataSourcePort` is `read()`/`query()`; there is no write. An org can be configured to read a
 * Confluence space and a Jira project and cannot be configured to write back to either, which is
 * why the shape below has no notion of a destination.
