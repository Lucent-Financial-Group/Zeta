/**
 * slot-dispatch.ts — what happens when an agent's chosen slot is supposed to DO something.
 *
 * ── THE NORTH STAR THIS IS BUILT AGAINST ─────────────────────────────────────
 * `agentic-organization/docs/OBSERVE_ACT_PROMOTION_GATE.md` defines three modes:
 *
 *   legacy               only the legacy lane runs
 *   observe_act_shadow   the menu is rendered, a slot is selected, EVIDENCE IS RECORDED — and
 *                        command and tool dispatch use SHADOW implementations
 *   observe_act_primary  command dispatch, tool dispatch and act-time authorization use the REAL
 *                        injected runtime
 *
 * and it is explicit that promotion is not the agent's to decide: *"Agents may select from legal
 * menu slots, but they do not decide whether the organization is safe to promote a lane."*
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS ACTUALLY HERE, AND WHY IT IS WORSE THAN SHADOW ──────────────────
 * The register had no mode, no dispatch seam and no gate. `run-org.ts` supplied
 *
 *     resultFor: (o) => o.tag === "PickWork"
 *       ? { workId: o.work.id, lane: o.work.lane, success: true, doraContribution: 0.5 }
 *       : undefined
 *
 * — a hardcoded success — and `run-agent.ts` supplied nothing at all. So the agent's choice either
 * reported work it had not done, or vanished.
 *
 * That is not shadow mode. A shadow lane's whole value is that it records what WOULD have happened
 * while everyone knows nothing did; a lane that fabricates `success: true` is indistinguishable in
 * the record from one that worked, which makes it the vacuity class sitting on top of the entire
 * pipeline this register spent fifteen passes making honest.
 *
 * ── THE THREE-STATE ANSWER, AGAIN ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * In shadow, the work was not done. `success: true` is a lie and `success: false` is also a lie —
 * it did not fail, it was not attempted. So a shadow dispatch returns NO `WorkResult` at all, and
 * the agent stays in `ExecutingWork`: picked up, outstanding. That is the true state, and
 * `WorkResult | undefined` already had a place to say it.
