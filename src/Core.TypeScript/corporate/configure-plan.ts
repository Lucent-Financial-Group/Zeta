/**
 * corporate/configure-plan.ts — setting an organization up, as a conversation an agent can hold.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT A PROMPT LOOP ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The obvious "guided setup" is a wizard: ask a question on the terminal, read a line, repeat. That
 * shape is wrong for this CLI specifically, because the thing driving it is an AI talking to a
 * person in another window. A wizard would put the agent in the position of typing answers into a
 * subprocess on the user's behalf — it cannot ask a follow-up, cannot explain WHY a question is
 * being asked, and cannot let the person change their mind three steps later.
 *
 * So the plan is DATA. `org configure` returns the next question, the reason for it, and the exact
 * command that answers it. The agent asks the person in its own words, runs that command, and asks
 * again. The conversation lives where conversations belong.
 *
 * ── DERIVED FROM STATE, NEVER A STORED POSITION ──────────────────────────────
 * There is no "wizard step 3 of 5" recorded anywhere. Every step reports whether it is satisfied by
 * looking at the organization as it actually is, which buys three properties for free:
 *
 *   - RESUMABLE. Come back a week later and the plan knows what is done.
 *   - IDEMPOTENT. Running a step's command twice does not advance a counter that then lies.
 *   - HONEST. Configuration changed by hand, or by another agent, is reflected immediately — a
 *     stored position would insist a step was done after somebody undid it.
 *
 * ── OPTIONAL STEPS DO NOT NAG ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Checkpoints and skill bindings are genuinely optional; most organizations never set either. If
 * `next` kept offering them, "guided setup" would become a questionnaire nobody can finish, and the
 * zero-config path this register works hard to keep would be a path you had to decline four times.
 * So `complete` is decided by the REQUIRED steps alone, and optional ones are offered once in their
 * own list, as suggestions rather than as remaining work.
