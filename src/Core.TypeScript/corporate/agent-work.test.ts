/**
 * agent-work.test.ts — an agent may act, and may not judge its own action.
 *
 * The fourth boundary was: *the model chooses; it doesn't work. Its authority is exactly one
 * clamped integer wide, deliberately.* This closes it at the seam rather than by widening that
 * authority — the agent now performs, and a verifier it does not control decides whether the
 * performance worked.
 *
 * One property carries the file, and every test here is a way of failing it:
 *
 *   THE AGENT PROPOSES. THE VERIFIER DECIDES. They are never the same party.
