/**
 * corporate/cli-surface.ts — the command surface, as DATA an agent can read.
 *
 * ── WHY THE SURFACE IS A VALUE ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `run-org.ts` grew sixty flags on one entry point. A person can learn that; an AI driving the
 * organization on someone's behalf cannot, because nothing tells it what exists. It has to be told
 * the flags in a prompt, and the prompt goes stale the moment a flag is added — the drift is
 * invisible until the AI calls something that no longer exists.
 *
 * So the commands are declared here as a table, and `org describe --json` prints it. The AI asks
 * the binary what it can do, and the answer is generated from the same value the parser uses, so
 * the two cannot disagree. That is the whole design: ONE declaration, used for parsing, for help,
 * and for discovery.
 *
 * ── EXIT CODES CARRY MEANING ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A driving agent branches on the exit code before it parses anything, so the codes distinguish
 * kinds of failure rather than all being 1. `REFUSED` in particular is not an error: the
 * organization declining to do something is a normal, expected answer — a gate held by policy, an
 * org that will not start work it has no hat for — and an agent that treats it as a crash will
 * retry forever.
 */

/**
 * The setting names and every legal value, DERIVED from the roster rather than restated.
 *
 * Both were literals while there was one setting, and adding a second would have left the CLI
 * refusing its name — a surface listing fewer knobs than exist is the same defect as one listing
 * more. Per-setting validity is still `validateSetting`'s; this only stops the parser refusing a
 * value that some OTHER setting accepts.
