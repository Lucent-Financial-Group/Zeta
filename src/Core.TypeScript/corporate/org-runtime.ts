/**
 * corporate/org-runtime.ts — the composition root. Every module in this register, in one pipeline.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * An import audit of `corporate/` found **62 of 189 exported values reached by any non-test
 * module**, and seven modules — `work-market`, `prioritization`, `assignment-engine`, `loop-policy`,
 * `work-projection`, `org-seed`, `org-cycle` — reached by NONE. Tested, correct, and consumed by
 * nothing: exactly the defect this package was started to fix, reproduced at scale by the fixing.
 *
 * `org-cycle.ts` runs the delivery loop and deliberately stays that. This runs the WHOLE
 * organization, and its job is to be the caller that makes the rest load-bearing:
 *
 *    1. INTAKE       external events arrive, are de-duplicated and triaged      (intake)
 *    2. PRIORITIZE   an authority orders what survived                          (prioritization)
 *    3. CASCADE      the top goal decomposes to owned tasks                     (goal-cascade)
 *    4. STAFF        ranked assignment issues real, expiring bindings           (assignment-engine,
 *                                                                               reputation, hat-binding)
 *    5. SCHEDULE     assignees get work blocks; the chain meets                 (work-schedule)
 *    6. MARKET       tasks become shards; agents claim, complete, review        (work-market)
 *    7. QA           cases derived from criteria run for real                   (qa)
 *    8. GATES        seven gates, with runtime-validation reading QA's verdict  (quality-gate)
 *    9. ESCALATE     repeated rejection is churn, broken structurally           (escalation)
 *   10. LOOP         the dev's OWN observe tick picks the work and reports back (loop-policy,
 *                                                                               work-projection)
 *
 * ── IT IS A FUNCTION OF ITS INPUTS ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * No clock, no randomness, no I/O. Same inputs, same report — which is what lets the end-to-end
 * claim be a test rather than a demonstration.
 *
 * ── REFUSALS ARE RESULTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every step that can be refused records the refusal and the pipeline continues where continuing is
 * meaningful. A runtime that stopped at the first refusal could only ever report the happy path.

 * The gates ONE work item owes — its own type's chain, intersected with the run's pipeline.

 * Both pipeline seams used to read `deps.pipeline ?? DEFAULT_PIPELINE`: one chain, every gate, for
 * every item in the run. Measured consequence, from a default run: a single implementation task
 * requested reviews for `business_context_grooming`, `customer_rfp_review` and `brd_approval` — a
 * backend hat walking the business chain, which is the "one agent does all fourteen steps"
 * complaint in its exact mechanical form.
 *
 * `chainFor` already answers what a goal, an initiative, a project or a leaf owes. It was written,
 * tested, and connected only to the read-only CLI, so the reporting surface and the executor
 * disagreed about what the organization does. This is the connection.
 *
 * ── THE RUN'S PIPELINE STILL BOUNDS IT ───────────────────────────────────────
 * Intersected rather than substituted: a caller that hands in a short pipeline — a spike lane, a
 * hotfix process — means it, and a work type's chain must not smuggle gates back in past a process
 * somebody deliberately narrowed. So the item owes what BOTH agree on, in the run's own order.
 *
 * An EMPTY intersection means the run's pipeline covers none of this type's gates. It walks
 * nothing rather than falling back to the whole pipeline, because the fallback is the defect.

   * ── THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES ───────────────────────────────────────────────
   * Decomposition mints two leaves under every project — `implement X` and `verify X` — and until
   * the edge existed nothing recorded that one needed the other. A `review` leaf produces no code,
   * so change control opens no branch for it, so it had no checkout of its own and its tests ran in
   * the BASE tree. And the base tree does not contain the work yet, because MERGING HAPPENS IN A
   * SEPARATE LOOP AFTER this one.
   *
   * MEASURED, with the runner tracing its own working directory and the base HEAD: `implement` ran
   * in its worktree with the suite present and exited 0; `verify` then ran three times against the
   * base checkout, every time at `head=skeleton` with `suiteExists=false`, was turned back at
   * `runtime_validation` each time, and the third rejection escalated to `add_agents` — which
   * halted the whole autonomy loop. Adding agents would not have helped: nothing was wrong with the
   * work, the worker, or the staffing. The check was asked to verify something that was not there.
   *
   * ── WHY THE EDGE, AND WHY THE DEPENDENCY'S CHECKOUT ──────────────────────
   * The first repair asked the runtime to infer the dependency — "an item of type `review` waits on
   * its non-review siblings". That is one true dependency written as code: no other dependency
   * could be expressed, and this one could not be inspected or overridden. Stated as data, whoever
   * decomposes says what waits for what, and this reads the edge without knowing why it is there.
   *
   * And a dependent item borrows the CHECKOUT of what it depends on, rather than waiting for it to
   * land. That is what review is for — judging the artifact before it merges is the only judgement
   * that can still stop it — and it is also the only form that works, since `done` is set in this
   * loop and the merge runs after it.

 * the runtime one — so it was a guard that could not fire, which is the vacuity class wearing a
 * safety belt. As a function over a map it can be handed a map with a hole in it.
