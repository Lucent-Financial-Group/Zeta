/**
 * cli-adapters.test.ts — the three ports that had no command line, and the mapping that gives them one.
 *
 * `httpIntake`, `agentWorkExecutor` and `agentReview` were exported, tested and mutation-checked, and
 * reachable from nothing but tests. `run-org.ts` exists because of exactly that, in its own words:
 * *"an entry point nothing outside a test suite invokes is a library nobody has shipped."*
 *
 * The interesting half is `trackerMapper`, because it is where a real tracker's schema meets this
 * register's, and where the temptation to GUESS lives. It refuses instead.
