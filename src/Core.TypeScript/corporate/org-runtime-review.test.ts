/**
 * org-runtime-review.test.ts — the gates are DECIDED now, not assumed.
 *
 * Measured before this port existed, over one run: 14 gate verdicts, 12 of them
 * `approved (reviewed)` — a constant — and 2 `runtime_validation approved (1/1 passed)`. Six of the
 * seven gate kinds could not fail, and `fidelityOf` reported four ports while saying nothing about
 * it. A gate that cannot fail is the vacuity class standing exactly where the organization makes
 * its quality claim.
 *
 * These tests are the falsifiers for the fix: a reviewer that rejects must STOP delivery, a
 * reviewer that cannot answer must not approve, and runtime validation must stay evidence-driven
 * rather than becoming one more opinion.
