/**
 * corporate/rmo.ts — the Resource Management Office: how many wearers a hat is authorized.
 *
 * ── THE SEAM THAT HAD NOTHING BEHIND IT ──────────────────────────────────────
 * `assignment-engine.ts` already takes a `supplyTarget` and already reports `supply_exhausted`
 * rather than over-staffing — and nothing computed that target. The RMO existed as a hat that
 * signals route to and as a number every caller had to invent. So the one decision the office is
 * for was being made by whoever happened to be calling it.
 *
 * The reference states the mechanism exactly: *"required hat supply is computed from
 * priority-weighted workload; supervisors vote; a majority-quorum tally yields a HatSupplyDecision
 * (expand/release/hold) with the median target."* Three parts, and each carries a refusal.
 *
 * ── WHY A VOTE AT ALL ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Staffing is the one decision where the person who wants the resource is the worst judge of how
 * much of it exists. A lead short of people always needs more; the organization's total supply is
 * finite. So the computation is a RECOMMENDATION and the authority is a quorum of the hat's own
 * supervisors — the same separation the gates use, applied to headcount.
 *
 * ── MEDIAN, NOT MEAN ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * One supervisor who asks for twelve moves a mean and does not move a median. The median is the
 * number a majority is at-or-past in both directions, which is what "the group decided" should
 * mean; a mean is a number nobody voted for and one outlier can pick.
 *
 * ── NO QUORUM IS NOT A DECISION ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A tally below quorum returns `no_quorum` and NOT `hold`. They look alike — nothing changes
 * either way — and they are opposite: `hold` is the supervisors deciding the current level is
 * right, `no_quorum` is them not having decided. Collapsing the two would let an unstaffed
 * organization report that its staffing was reviewed and approved.
