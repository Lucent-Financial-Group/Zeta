/**
 * branch-topology.test.ts — what a change is called, and what it branches from.
 *
 * The property worth defending hardest is the NEGATIVE one: a single defect must not acquire an
 * integration branch. Every inbound request is decomposed into a full `goal -> initiative ->
 * project -> leaf` chain, so a rule keyed on the work TYPE would give a one-line fix a feature
 * branch, a merge into it, and a merge out of it, to carry one commit. The rule is keyed on how
 * much code actually sits under a rung, and these tests are mostly about that distinction.
