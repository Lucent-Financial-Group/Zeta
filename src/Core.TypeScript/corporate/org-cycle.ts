/**
 * corporate/org-cycle.ts — one full turn of the organization, end to end.
 *
 * This is the module that makes the other five a system rather than five libraries. It runs the
 * whole loop the corporate register describes, in order, with every step's refusal surfaced rather
 * than skipped:
 *
 *   1. the C-suite ACCEPTS a goal                              (goal-cascade)
 *   2. it CASCADES to initiative → project → task, each rung owned by the accountable level
 *   3. the lead asks the RMO to STAFF the unassigned tasks     (supervisor-signal, routed)
 *   4. the RMO DECIDES on the anchor, and the decision is the record
 *   5. assignees are SCHEDULED prioritized-work blocks         (work-schedule)
 *   6. the accountable chain MEETS — one booking across every calendar, atomic
 *   7. a dev hits a BLOCKER and signals upward with evidence
 *   8. the supervisor cannot resolve it, so it ESCALATES past them
 *   9. work completes and DELIVERY ROLLS UP from the leaves to the goal
 *
 * ── IT IS A FUNCTION OF ITS INPUTS ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * No clock, no randomness, no I/O. `nowMs` and `createId` are supplied, so the same inputs produce
 * the same report — which is what lets the cycle be a test rather than a demo, and what
 * `.claude/rules/local-time-never-enters-the-shared-fold.md` requires of anything two hats must
 * agree about.
 *
 * ── REFUSALS ARE RESULTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every step that can be refused records the refusal and the cycle CONTINUES where continuing is
 * meaningful. A cycle that threw on the first refusal would only ever report the happy path, and
 * the interesting question about an organization is what it does when a step does not go through.
