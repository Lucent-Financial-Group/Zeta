/**
 * corporate/prioritization.ts — what the organization does first, and who is allowed to say.
 *
 * ── THE GAP THIS CLOSES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The cycle ran ONE goal. With two, nothing in this register could say which comes first, and
 * "priority" existed only as an unranked queue. Once goals compete, the ordering IS the
 * organization's answer to what it is for.
 *
 * ── DETERMINISM RECOMMENDS; AN AUTHORITY DECIDES ─────────────────────────────
 * The score is computed from inputs anyone can check, and it produces a RECOMMENDATION. The final
 * class is chosen by an authority hat through `chooseWithinLegal`, clamped to what that level may
 * set. Neither half alone would do: a score nobody can override is a policy the organization cannot
 * change, and a class with no recommendation behind it is a preference with no argument.
 *
 * ── THE REASON CODES ARE THE POINT ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * A bare number tells nobody why. Every term that contributed names itself, so "why is this
 * expedited" is answerable from the recommendation rather than by re-running the arithmetic in
 * someone's head.
 *
 * ── TWO DIVERGENCES FROM THE REFERENCE, BOTH DELIBERATE ──────────────────────
 *
 * **1. `estimatedEffort` is actually applied.** In the reference it is a REQUIRED field of
 * `PriorityInputs`, is supplied by callers, and is never read — while the comment beside the scoring
 * says *"budget burn + high effort push DOWN"*. So a caller raising it to deprioritise a large job
 * sees no effect and has no way to find out why. Here it lowers the score, which is what the field
 * was named and documented to do.
 *
 * **2. The authority ladder has three real rungs, not two.** The reference gives Director and the
 * C-suite the same five classes, so the level distinction between them is decorative. `Paused` stops
 * work entirely — an org-level decision — so it is reserved for the C-suite and the board here, which
 * makes Director a genuine rung rather than a synonym.
