/**
 * org-observe-bridge.ts — the organization filling the observe algebra's peer verbs.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS CONNECTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `observe.ts` gained five verbs for working with other agents — review an artifact, answer one,
 * convene a room, say what is missing, hand work over. They are GENERIC: the core takes strings and
 * knows nothing about hats, gates or anchors, exactly as `MainDeps.surface` already works.
 *
 * This module is what makes them real. One direction derives the surface FROM the organization —
 * what has been asked of this hat, what rooms it is in, what it is blocked on, who it may convene,
 * what it may hand out. The other applies a chosen action BACK: a review becomes a gate's evidence,
 * an ask becomes a routed supervisor signal, an assignment becomes an assignment.
 *
 * Direction is unchanged and non-negotiable: corporate imports the core, never the reverse
 * (`register-boundary.test.ts`).
 *
 * ── EVERY OFFER IS DERIVED, NONE IS DECLARED ─────────────────────────────────
 * A hat is offered `review_artifact` because a `RequestReview` signal is addressed to it and open —
 * not because someone set a flag. It is offered `assign_work` for the items in its own scope and
 * only to its direct reports, because that is what the chart says. The menu is a projection of the
 * organization's actual state, so an agent cannot be offered an act the organization would refuse,
 * and cannot be denied one it is owed.
 *
 * ── WHAT DECIDES WHO DRIVES WHAT ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Nothing here names a role. A TPM ends up driving assignment because assignment is offered to hats
 * whose reports can take the work; a director ends up deciding execution because a `RequestDecision`
 * routes to the level that holds it; an engineering manager ends up unblocking people because
 * `AskQuestion` and `ReportBlocker` route to the immediate supervisor. Encoding "TPMs assign" as a
 * rule would freeze one org's shape into the machine — the chart is the shape, and it is data.
