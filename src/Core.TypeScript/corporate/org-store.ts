/**
 * corporate/org-store.ts — the organization's history, on disk.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS IN MEMORY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `runOrgRuntime` produced a cascade, a calendar, an anchor board, a queue and a typed event trace,
 * and every one of them was a value that died with the process. So the organization could be run
 * and could not be RESUMED, audited across runs, or asked what it did last week — and `org-event.ts`
 * exists precisely so those questions are answerable.
 *
 * ── THE TRACE IS ALREADY THE LOG ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Nothing new needed inventing. `OrgEvent` is already an append-only record of what happened, each
 * one carrying its own `atMs`, its subject, its actor and the supervisor chain that authorised it.
 * Persisting it is one shard per event — the convention in `shard-store.ts`, so the merge is set
 * union and two writers never contend for a path.
 *
 * ── WHY THE TRACE AND NOT THE CASCADE ────────────────────────────────────────
 * Storing the cascade, calendar and board as snapshots would put a SECOND record of the same facts
 * beside the events that produced them, and the two can disagree — the failure this register keeps
 * refusing everywhere else (a metric that disagrees with what it counts, a parent state that
 * disagrees with its leaves). The events are the facts; anything else is a fold over them, and a
 * fold cannot drift from its own input.
 *
 * The honest limit, stated rather than hidden: a full `Cascade` fold from events is NOT implemented
 * here. What this gives is a durable, queryable, mergeable history — not yet a resumable runtime.
 * `runsIn` and `eventsFor` answer "what did this organization do"; rebuilding the live value
 * objects from the log is the next step and is not claimed by this module.

/**
 * Identity of a stored event: its CONTENT ADDRESS — the same one that chose its filename.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS REPLACED, AND THE DATA LOSS IT CAUSED ──────────────────────────
 * This used to return `event.id`, reasoning that the runtime had already assigned an identity and
 * that re-deriving one would create a second notion of it. The intent was right: two copies of one
 * event — a re-run, a merged branch — must collapse to one.
 *
 * But the store ALREADY had a content notion: `shardPath` derives every filename from the record's
 * content. So there were two notions and they disagreed, and the disagreement lost data. Two
 * genuinely DIFFERENT events that share an id land at different paths — both written — and then
 * `readShards` drops one, because it de-duplicates on this function.
 *
 * Measured on `run-org.ts --store S` run twice with different flags, which mints the same ids every
 * invocation (`nowMs` is fixed and the counter restarts): **78 event files on disk, 58 returned.**
 * Twenty events written and unreadable, with nothing anywhere saying so.
 *
 * ── THE CONTENT ADDRESS SATISFIES THE ORIGINAL INTENT STRICTLY BETTER ────────
 *   - two byte-identical copies of one event  -> same address -> collapse, as before
 *   - two DIFFERENT events sharing an id      -> different addresses -> both survive
 *
 * And it removes the second notion rather than adding one: identity is now the filename, so "two
 * files" and "two events" are the same statement.
 *
 * It does NOT excuse a writer minting colliding ids — `run-agent.ts` scopes its ids to the run's
 * instant for exactly that reason — but a writer's mistake must not silently delete history.
