/**
 * corporate/org-fold.ts — the organization rebuilt from its own event log.
 *
 * ── THE HOLE THIS CLOSES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `org-store.ts` made the trace durable and said plainly what it did not do: *"a full `Cascade`
 * fold from events is NOT implemented here … a durable, queryable, mergeable history — not yet a
 * resumable runtime."* The agent loop resumed; the organization did not. Its cascade and calendar
 * were recomputed from the inputs each time, which works only because the runtime is deterministic
 * and stops working the moment anything about a run is not reproducible from its arguments.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS NEEDED A CHANGE TO THE EVENTS FIRST ─────────────────────────────
 * The trace could not support this as it stood. `decision` is prose — *"owns defect 'implement the
 * coupon fix'"* — with the work type inside the sentence and the parent not in it at all, so
 * folding would have meant parsing English. `OrgEvent` was built as an AUDIT TRAIL: it answers what
 * happened, who decided, and under what authority. It could not answer what IS.
 *
 * So state-constituting events now carry an `OrgFact` beside the sentence. The prose stays the
 * reading; the fact is the record. That is the difference between a log you can read and a log you
 * can rebuild from.
 *
 * ── THE FALSIFIER ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A fold is only trustworthy if it reproduces what it folded. `org-fold.test.ts` runs the real
 * runtime, folds ITS OWN trace, and asserts the result equals the runtime's cascade and calendar
 * node for node. If the log is missing a fact, that test fails — which is the point: it makes
 * "the log is sufficient" a checkable claim rather than a hopeful one.
 *
 * ── ORDER IS THE LOG'S, NOT THE READER'S ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Events are folded in the order they happened (`atMs`, then id), never in file order. A fold that
 * depended on how the shards happened to be listed would give different state on different
 * machines from identical data.

  //      5,000          30 ms    3 ms      33 ms    (fold is 8%)
  //     20,000          65 ms    4 ms      68 ms    (fold is 5%)
  //     60,000         177 ms    9 ms     186 ms    (fold is 5%)

  // them — the thing `org-store.ts` refuses in its own header, because the two can disagree.
  //
  // Written down rather than left as an absence so the next reader does not have to re-derive the
  // case for building it. If the fold ever grows to dominate a resume, the numbers above are what
  // to compare against.
