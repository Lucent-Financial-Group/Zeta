/**
 * corporate/org-chart.ts — the reporting graph. Who supervises whom, and how far apart two hats are.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `observe/room/hat-gate.ts` already carries `HatLevel`, and says so plainly: *"mirrors
 * agentic-organization HatLevel"*. But a level is a RANK, not an ORGANIZATION. Before this module
 * the canonical package had six tiers and no graph: no `reportsTo`, no departments, no named hats,
 * no way to ask who a blocker goes to. `grep -r reportsTo src/Core.TypeScript` returned nothing.
 *
 * That absence is what made three separate things impossible, all of which the corporate register
 * specifies and none of which can be built on a bare rank:
 *
 *   - **Escalation** (`SUPERVISOR_CHAIN_COMMUNICATION.md`) routes to *"who supervises that duty"* —
 *     a specific hat, not "someone senior".
 *   - **A goal cascade** must hand a rung to an owner who actually reports to the rung above,
 *     otherwise the tree is an org chart drawn twice and agreeing by luck.
 *   - **Schedule ownership** (`AGENT_WORK_RHYTHM_AND_PROMPT_FLOWS.md`) is per-layer: a supervising
 *     hat may adjust a subordinate's schedule. "Supervising" is an edge, and there were no edges.
 *
 * ── THIS IS THE CORPORATE REGISTER, NOT THE SOVEREIGN CORE ───────────────────
 * Per `docs/DECISIONS/2026-05-31-observe-act-16-direction-universal-action-grammar-local-no-cloud-llm.md`,
 * the observe-algebra is CANONICAL and the corporate workflow *retrofits onto it*. So everything in
 * `corporate/` composes over the canonical substrate and nothing in the sovereign core may import
 * it — a hierarchy is one register's policy, not a property of the machine. That direction is
 * enforced by a test (`register-boundary.test.ts`), not asserted in a comment.

/**
 * Build a validated chart, or REFUSE with the reason.
 *
 * Four things are checked, and each is a shape that would otherwise produce a chart that reads fine
 * and routes wrongly:
 *
 *   1. **ids are unique** — a duplicate id silently shadows a hat, so signals route to whichever
 *      copy the map happened to keep.
 *   2. **every `reportsTo` resolves** — a dangling supervisor truncates the chain, and a truncated
 *      chain looks exactly like "reached the top" to any caller that walks it.
 *   3. **exactly one root** — two roots means two organizations, and escalation from one can never
 *      reach the other. Zero roots means a cycle.
 *   4. **no hat reports DOWNWARD** — a director reporting to an IC type-checks and is not an
 *      organization.
 *
 * Rule 4 is deliberately *not* "reports to a strictly higher level", which is what this module
 * checked first. The reference organization refutes that: in `agentic-organization`'s seed the CTO
 * reports to the CEO and **both are `c_suite`**, and the Chief Architect (also `c_suite`) reports to
 * the CTO. Peer reporting inside the C-suite is how the real chart is shaped, so the strict rule
 * would have rejected the very organization this register exists to run.
 *
 * That relaxation is why the reach-the-root walk below is load-bearing rather than belt-and-braces:
 * once same-level edges are legal, `ceo → cto → ceo` is a cycle the level rule cannot see, and the
 * walk is the only thing that catches it.
 *
 * Returning a reason rather than throwing keeps a malformed chart a value the caller can inspect;
 * throwing would make the most interesting case the hardest to test.
