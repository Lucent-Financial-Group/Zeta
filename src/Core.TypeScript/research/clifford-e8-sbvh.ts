/**
 * clifford-e8-sbvh.ts — RUNG 8: THE 7.6x WAS A MEASUREMENT OF OUR BVH, NOT OF CPU RAY TRACING.
 *
 * Rung 7 shipped a CPU tracer over the derived 2-skeleton and concluded, in writing:
 *
 * > *"Is it fast on a CPU? No — measured, at 0.5 fps for 128² on one core."*
 *
 * with **2,780 triangle tests per ray** and a **7.6x** speedup over exhaustive scan, and it
 * defended those numbers like this:
 *
 * > *"A 7.6x speedup from a BVH is a bad speedup, and it is not the BVH's fault. With 738x
 * > overdraw a ray genuinely meets on the order of a thousand triangles; 2,780 tests to find
 * > them is a small constant over the true answer."*
 *
 * **That defence is a category error, and this module exists because measuring it refuted it.**
 * A ray does meet ~1,586 triangles here (measured below, and rung 7's estimate was good). But
 * a *nearest-hit* query does not have to find them. It has to find the FIRST one. The number
 * of triangles at-or-before the nearest hit is **0.49 per ray** — the answer set is one
 * triangle, not a thousand. Comparing 2,780 tests against the count of *all* crossings
 * measures the wrong query. Against the query actually being asked, 2,780 is not "a small
 * constant over the true answer"; it is roughly **5,700x** the true answer.
 *
 * ## What is actually wrong, in two separable parts (both measured, §Diagnosis in the doc)
 *
 * 1. **The traversal is not front-to-back.** `intersectBvh` pushes children in a fixed order
 *    and never sorts by entry distance, so `best` stays large for most of the descent and the
 *    `t > best` prune barely fires. Replaying the *same tree* with a distance-ordered
 *    traversal costs **1,205** tests/ray instead of 2,777 — a 2.3x factor that is pure
 *    traversal policy and involves no change to the structure at all.
 *
 * 2. **The tree cannot separate the primitives.** Sum of leaf bounding-box surface areas over
 *    the root's is **2,577** (a perfect partition is 1.0), and the mean leaf box is **40.5%**
 *    of the root diagonal. That is the object-partitioning failure mode exactly: the mean
 *    triangle bounding box is 29.3% of the scene diagonal, so *no* assignment of whole
 *    triangles to boxes can produce boxes that do not overlap almost everything.
 *
 * Part 2 is what **Stich, Friedrich & Dietrich**, *Spatial Splits in Bounding Volume
 * Hierarchies*, HPG 2009, is the canonical fix for. Their diagnosis is ours verbatim: object
 * partitioning fails when primitives are large relative to the leaves they must fit in,
 * because a bounding volume around a large primitive is mostly empty and mostly shared. Their
 * repair is to stop insisting that a primitive live in exactly one leaf — a reference may be
 * **split across the plane**, with each half clipped to its side, so the boxes get tight even
 * though the triangles stay big. This module implements that, and its cheaper rival.
 *
 * ## What is authored and what is derived
 *
 * **Everything in this file is authored.** A BVH is not a claim about E8; it is an index over
 * an answer computed elsewhere. `alpha`, the bin count, the leaf size and the split rule are
 * performance parameters, and the falsifiers in the sibling test assert that **none of them
 * can change which triangle is nearest** — every structure here is checked against
 * `intersectBruteForce`, which is the meter rung 7 was right to keep.
 *
 * ## The tie-break is preserved, and spatial splits make that non-trivial
 *
 * Rung 7 measured that ~1% of rays meet two triangles at bit-identical depth and declared
 * **ties go to the lowest triangle index**. Spatial splits make the same triangle appear in
 * several leaves, so a ray can test one triangle two or three times and see the same `t`
 * twice. The declared rule survives that unchanged — `d < best || (d === best && tri < hit)`
 * is false against a triangle already chosen, so a duplicate reference is idempotent, not a
 * tie-break hazard. Falsified rather than argued: `intersectOrdered` over the SBVH returns
 * the same `(triangle, t)` as brute force on every seeded ray, and a mutant that drops the
 * tie-break is killed.
 *
 * ## Registers
 *
 * - `metered` — every tests/ray and timing figure in the rung 8 doc, on named hardware, one
 *   thread, no SIMD. The point of excluding both is that the remaining factor is algorithmic.
 * - `metered` — nearest-hit agreement with brute force; the reference-containment invariant;
 *   node bounds containing their children.
 * - `unmetered` — anything about other hardware, other languages, or a vectorised inner loop.
 *
 * ## Prior art (Beacon)
 *
 * - **Stich, Friedrich & Dietrich**, *Spatial Splits in Bounding Volume Hierarchies*, High
 *   Performance Graphics 2009 — the SBVH: chopped binning, the `alpha` overlap criterion that
 *   decides when a spatial split is worth its duplication, and reference unsplitting.
 * - **Wald**, *On fast Construction of SAH-based Bounding Volume Hierarchies*, IEEE Symposium
 *   on Interactive Ray Tracing 2007 — binned SAH construction, the object-split half here.
 * - **Goldsmith & Salmon**, *Automatic Creation of Object Hierarchies for Ray Tracing*, IEEE
 *   CG&A 1987; **MacDonald & Booth**, *Heuristics for Ray Tracing Using Space Subdivision*,
 *   The Visual Computer 1990 — the surface-area heuristic itself. Rung 7 named these as the
 *   next step and did not take it; this module takes it and reports what it was worth.
 * - **Sutherland & Hodgman**, *Reentrant Polygon Clipping*, CACM 17(1), 1974 — the polygon
 *   clip used to compute a triangle's bounds inside a bin, which is what makes a spatial
 *   split tight rather than merely legal.
 * - **Pharr, Jakob & Humphreys**, *Physically Based Rendering* 4th ed., §4.3 — the ordered
 *   front-to-back traversal with the `t > best` cutoff that fixes part 1.
 * - **Möller & Trumbore** 1997 · **Williams, Barrus, Morley & Shirley** 2005 — reused from
 *   rung 7 unchanged; this module adds no new intersection arithmetic.

/**
 * Split every triangle into four by joining edge midpoints, `times` times over.
 *
 * The rival hypothesis to a spatial-split build: if the pathology is that primitives are large
 * relative to the scene, make them small and keep the plain object-split BVH. One subdivision
 * multiplies the triangle count by 4 and halves every edge, so the mean primitive bounding box
 * halves too. It changes the *surface not at all* — midpoint subdivision of a planar triangle
 * is exact, the union of the four children is the parent, so every ray meets the same surface
 * at the same depth and the level is inherited unchanged.
 *
 * Two costs it is measured against SBVH on: memory grows 4^times in the position buffer
 * (SBVH's grows by the duplication factor, measured near 1.2x), and the triangle test count is
 * not obviously reduced, because a ray crossing a big triangle also crosses one of its
 * children. What subdivision buys is *bounding-box locality*; what it does not buy is fewer
 * true crossings.
 *
 * The level buffer is expanded to match, so a subdivided scene renders identically.
