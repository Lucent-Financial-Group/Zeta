/**
 * b-ref-resolve.ts — resolve a legacy `B-NNNN` reference to something that
 * actually exists in the tree.
 *
 * ## Why this module replaced a ban
 *
 * The predecessor gate (`lint-no-b-refs.ts`) forbade *writing* a hyphenated
 * legacy id on any authored surface. That is the vacuity class: if no legacy
 * ref may exist in tree, then no *stale* legacy ref can exist either, so the
 * check could never fire on the thing it nominally guarded. It bought
 * compliance by eliminating its own subject — and its observable cost was
 * authors bending prose (`B0747` written hyphenless) to route around a gate
 * that had nothing left to catch.
 *
 * Aaron 2026-08-15: *"if the gate is too restrictive I'd rather change it and
 * do better drift checks."*
 *
 * So the gate now **permits the reference and checks that it resolves**. That
 * is strictly stronger: it catches a fabricated id, a typo'd id, and a real id
 * whose target was deleted — none of which the ban could see — while letting
 * lineage prose name the thing it is talking about.
 *
 * ## What "resolves" means (the ladder)
 *
 * A legacy ref resolves when a reader can open something real:
 *
 * 1. **`live`** — the alias maps carry the id, and the ZetaId they name has a
 *    row file under `docs/backlog/P0..P3`, `workitems`, or `workitems/done`.
 *    This is the migrated case (B-0732 → `081KSE6WT0008QG0R002YBWBB1`).
 * 2. **`archive`** — no live row, but the id names a surviving artifact under
 *    the recovered-orphan-branch archive. The row never landed on `main`; the
 *    reference still points at a file a reader can open (B-0747).
 * 3. **unresolved** — neither. The reference points at nothing. FAIL.
 *
 * Presence in `b-to-zetaid-map.json` is deliberately **not** sufficient. That
 * map was rebuilt by mining git history for `B-NNNN` tokens, so it contains
 * ids in the B-2xxx / B-8xxx / B-9xxx bands that were never rows at all.
 * Requiring the target to exist on disk is what makes the check a drift check
 * rather than a second spelling of the map. Measured on the tree that
 * introduced this module: 1160 of 1251 mapped ids resolve `live`, 14 resolve
 * `archive`, and 77 resolve to nothing — so the predicate discriminates.
 *
 * ## What this module does NOT do
 *
 * It does not re-open `B-NNNN` minting. Referencing an existing legacy id in
 * prose is now allowed and checked; *creating* B-numbered work stays forbidden
 * by `lint-no-new-bnnnn.ts` (B-named FILES) and by the frontmatter guard built
 * from `isRowFile` + `frontmatterOf` below (a legacy id used as a row KEY, not
 * named as a reference). See `.claude/rules/workitems-mint-with-zetaid.md`.
