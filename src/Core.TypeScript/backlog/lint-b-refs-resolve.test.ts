/**
 * Falsifiability harness for lint-b-refs-resolve.ts.
 *
 * ## Why this file is written the way it is
 *
 * The predecessor gate BANNED hyphenated legacy ids on authored surfaces. That
 * is the vacuity class in its purest form: if the mention is forbidden, a
 * *stale* mention cannot exist, so the check had no subject left to catch. It
 * was green because it had removed everything it could have failed on.
 *
 * The replacement permits the mention and checks that it RESOLVES. That is a
 * strictly larger claim, so it needs a strictly larger harness. These tests pin
 * four things, and the check is worthless if any of them stops holding:
 *
 *   1. it FIRES on a reference that points at nothing (the new catch);
 *   2. it PASSES a reference that points at something real (the new permission
 *      — without this, the change bought nothing);
 *   3. presence in the alias map is NOT sufficient (otherwise the resolver is
 *      just a second spelling of the map, and rot is invisible again);
 *   4. it still refuses a legacy id in a row's frontmatter, and
 *      `lint-no-new-bnnnn.ts` still refuses a B-named FILE — so this loosening
 *      cannot be read as re-opening B-NNNN minting.
 *
 * The scope/boundary tests carried over from the predecessor are kept: a lint's
 * scan scope is the other easy route to unfalsifiability, and widening a skip
 * prefix over a live authored surface must still go red.
