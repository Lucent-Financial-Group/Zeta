// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE FALSIFIER FOR STAGE-THEN-LINK, which shipped without one and said so.
//
// `claimGeneration` used to `open(path,"wx")` and write the owner one syscall later. O_EXCL is
// atomic about the NAME and silent about the CONTENT, so between those calls the generation
// existed and was unparseable -- and this module's own rule is that an unparseable generation
// is not-held and gets SUPERSEDED. Live cost: three of eight processes holding one exclusive
// lock (081M2E7ZHYC087G0R000NDNQ2F).
//
// THE FIX SHIPPED UNFALSIFIED AND I SAID SO AT THE TIME: reverting it left the whole suite at
// 21 pass / 0 fail. Three approaches were tried before this one worked, and they are recorded
// because each is a plausible thing for the next person to reach for:
//
//   fs.watch on the lock directory      macOS coalesces; 10/10 trials reported only `0.lock`,
//                                       never the staging file. Not an observer.
//   spin-reader doing readdir           scanning a growing directory is microseconds per pass
//                                       while the window is nanoseconds: 0 hits in 28,018
//                                       claims against the DEFECTIVE build. False green.
//   plant a zero-byte generation        tests the tolerated case (corrupt => supersede), which
//                                       is unchanged by the fix. Passes either way.
//
// WHAT WORKS: a second process spinning on ONE FIXED PATH with no readdir, while this process
// claims the same generation over and over. Measured:
//
//   create-then-write (defective)   empty=6981   full=48267   over 32,005 claims
//   stage-then-link   (fixed)       empty=0      full=15845   over  6,142 claims
//
// `empty` is the defect being observed directly -- the generation existing with no content.
//
// BOUNDED BY A CLAIM COUNT, NOT BY A CLOCK. The reader stops when this process drops a sentinel
// file, so nothing here asserts on elapsed time and `audit-ambient-time-in-tests` has nothing
// to allowlist. The one `full > 0` assertion is the control that keeps the whole thing honest:
// a reader that never managed to open the file would report `empty = 0` and pass vacuously,
// which is exactly how the readdir attempt above fooled me for one run.
