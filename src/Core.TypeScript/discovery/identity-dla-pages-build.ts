/**
 * Builds the standalone Identity DLA client into the root GitHub Pages artifact.
 * This is intentionally TypeScript rather than a shell wrapper: the page path,
 * package manager version, output directory, and failure boundary are explicit.
 *
 * WHY pnpm is fetched here instead of installed at the repo root:
 * `demo/identity-dla-site` is a separate project living inside a bun repo — it has
 * its own `pnpm-lock.yaml` and its own `packageManager` pin, while the root declares
 * `bun`. Carrying `pnpm` in ROOT devDependencies made every `bun install` call site in
 * CI fetch and extract a tarball that exactly one consumer uses, and that extraction
 * flaked four times across unrelated jobs on 2026-08-13
 * (`error: Fail extracting tarball for "pnpm"`). So the cost sits with the consumer:
 * this builder provisions pnpm on demand, at the version the site itself declares.
 * See workitem 081KZYAGTB6087G0R002W8CWQK.
