// Storage size profiles — the per-deployment ladder for `longhorn` PVC capacity.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// Aaron 2026-08-20: "until we have some other formatting we should try to take
// up all storage with PVCs, we also need a minimal size. We should not over
// provision. Some of our boxes are NASs some are regular PCs. I think if we can
// get the minimum down to 200-300 gb it should be small enough."
//
// Four constraints that pull against each other:
//   (a) never declare more capacity than the node's real disk       HARD
//   (b) a minimum profile that fits a 200-300 GiB box
//   (c) on a bigger box, use the storage rather than leaving it idle
//   (d) heterogeneous hardware, so the choice is per-deployment
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT: it is not elasticity, and the shape of the file is the
// admission. Kubernetes can GROW a PVC (with allowVolumeExpansion plus an
// online filesystem grow) but it cannot SHRINK one at all — the only way down
// is destroy and restore from backup. So "size it for the big box and shrink
// later" is a one-way door: a volume provisioned at 200Gi can never be moved
// onto a 300 GiB node. That is why (c) is served by a LADDER chosen once at
// bring-up rather than by a controller that resizes on the fly. Faking
// elasticity here would produce exactly the failure the whole readiness
// auditor exists to prevent: a number that looks like a guarantee and is not.
//
// HOW IT COMPOSES WITH THE CAPACITY GATE
// --------------------------------------
// `single-node-readiness.ts` already refuses when no ClusterNode registration
// carries measurable hardware, and convicts when declared capacity exceeds
// every block device on the smallest measured node. This module supplies the
// DECLARED side of that comparison for the ACTIVE profile, and it does so from
// a catalogue rather than from the auditor's YAML extractor, because the
// extractor is measurably blind in both directions:
//
//   under-count  mimir renders 3 ingester pods and 3 store-gateway pods from
//                chart defaults our YAML never mentions (zone-aware
//                replication over 3 zones). +200 GiB the extractor cannot see.
//   over-count   the nearest-enclosing-replicas heuristic gives redis MASTER
//                the neighbouring `replica.replicaCount: 2`. -10 GiB that
//                does not exist.
//
// So the catalogue is a SECOND ORACLE, not a restatement: it carries the pod
// count with its provenance, the extractor derives one from the YAML, and
// `crossCheckClaims` below makes their disagreement a finding instead of a
// silent choice between two numbers. Neither side can go stale unnoticed —
// a claim with no catalogue row fails, and a catalogue row matching no claim
// fails.
//
// DECLARED vs SCHEDULED-AT-BRING-UP
// ---------------------------------
// Some declared capacity provisions nothing on a fresh sync (a manual-sync
// Application, or a PVC manifest no Application reaches). That is REPORTED,
// never DISCOUNTED. Longhorn's StorageClass is volumeBindingMode: Immediate
// (hardcoded in longhorn-1.7.2/templates/storageclass.yaml), so an applied PVC
// provisions its replica with zero consuming pods; what keeps the capacity off
// the disk is the Application never being applied, and that is one
// `argocd app sync` away from being false. Convicting on the bring-up subset
// would be a gate that passes today and fails the first time someone ran it.

// ===========================================================================
// CPU / MEMORY PROFILES — the same ladder, for the resource the DEV RUNNER runs
// out of first.
//
// WHY THIS LIVES IN THE SAME FILE AND THE SAME CATALOGUE
// -----------------------------------------------------
// Aaron 2026-08-20: "sounds like we can set some resource limits for our dev
// runners and different defaults for physical hardware, we should try to make
// things small enough to fit for disk and ram on the runners."
//
// That is the storage ladder's problem with two more axes on it, so it gets the
// storage ladder's mechanism rather than a parallel one: a rung chosen once per
// deployment, every cut priced in the row that makes it, and every number our
// own YAML cannot carry written down with its provenance.
//
// THE TWO RUNGS, AND WHY `metal` IS A NO-OP
// -----------------------------------------
//   dev     sized to fit a GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-24.04` standard runner
//   metal   BYTE-FOR-BYTE what the manifests render today
//
// `metal` is defined as the status quo for exactly the reason `large` was:
// naming what already runs is not the same as endorsing it, and it means
// nothing in this change shrinks the hardware deployment. Aaron asked for the
// split in those words -- different defaults for physical hardware -- so `dev`
// is the only rung that cuts anything.
//
// WHAT A REQUEST IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
// -------------------------------------
// A CPU/memory REQUEST is a SCHEDULING RESERVATION. It is what the kube
// scheduler subtracts from a node's allocatable when it decides whether a pod
// fits; it is NOT a cap, and it is NOT a measurement of the process's working
// set. So the arithmetic below answers exactly one question -- "will the
// scheduler admit all of these onto one 4-vCPU / 16-GB node" -- and it answers
// no other. In particular:
//
//   * cutting a request below the app's real working set does NOT make the app
//     smaller. Without a matching limit the pod simply becomes more
//     over-committed, and the failure moves from a Pending pod (loud, obvious,
//     scheduler-attributed) to the kernel OOM killer (quiet, arbitrary,
//     attributed to whichever process happened to be biggest). Every `dev` cut
//     therefore has to say what it costs, and `loadResourceCatalogue` refuses a
//     row that does not.
//   * 28 of the 45 Applications in this tree render pods that request NOTHING
//     AT ALL (`resources: {}` chart defaults). Those pods are BestEffort: the
//     scheduler will admit any number of them and this arithmetic will never
//     see them. The declared total is a FLOOR on the requirement, never the
//     requirement, and the envelope keeps unreserved headroom precisely so
//     those pods have somewhere to live. See `$comment_resources` in the
//     catalogue for the measurement.
// ===========================================================================
