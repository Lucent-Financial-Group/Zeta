/**
 * provider-conditional-lift.test.ts — a LIFTS WHEN the mechanism can evaluate.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.
 *
 * `cilium`'s recorded exclusion reason says it lifts when "the app-of-apps
 * included proof runs on that profile, so ArgoCD is reconciling a cluster whose
 * CNI slot Cilium already owns." That became true on 2026-08-31 when the k3d
 * lane went green at `--scope included`.
 *
 * It could not fire. `isExcludedFromIncludedProof` took no provider argument and
 * `discoverExpectedApplications` threaded none, so the condition was unevaluable
 * by the code that enforces it — a promise in prose with no mechanism behind it.
 * That is the vacuity class pointed at an EXIT condition rather than at a check.
 *
 * The other half is `cilium-lb-ipam`, and it is the more interesting one: its
 * lift is CONJUNCTIVE and the second conjunct is measurably FALSE, so it must
 * stay excluded even though its sibling lifted.
