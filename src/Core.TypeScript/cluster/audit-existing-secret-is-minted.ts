// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE BREAK THIS WAS WRITTEN FROM, WHICH WAS MINE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The redis -> valkey migration (#16292) wrote:
//
//     auth:
//       usersExistingSecret: redis-auth   # create via Sealed Secret / Vault
//
// That comment is true of metal and false of the dev lane, and nothing said so.
// `applyDevBootstrapSecrets` mints the credentials Applications expect to find
// ALREADY PRESENT -- `monitoring/grafana-admin-credentials` for
// kube-prometheus-stack, the ziti admin Secret for oz -- and redis was never
// added to it. The chart then refuses to render a user with no credential, the
// Application sat OutOfSync/Progressing in the included proof, and the defect
// reached a lane rather than a check.
//
// The shape is one this repo already knows: change an Application, re-derive
// what is keyed to it. The observability roster taught it for a GENERATED FILE.
// This is the same lesson for a RUNTIME dependency, which is worse, because a
// stale generated file fails in CI in seconds and a missing Secret fails after a
// cluster has been built and an Application has tried to sync.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT IT CHECKS, AND THE ONE THING IT REFUSES TO GUESS
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Every `*existingSecret`-shaped value in every Application's `valuesObject` is
// a NAME, and a name is a promise that something else creates the object. The
// audit collects them and asks one question of each: does the dev bootstrap
// roster mint it?
//
//   MINTED      the roster carries it. Nothing to do.
//   NOT MINTED  refused, unless the baseline carries a reason -- because the
//               honest answers ("this Application is excluded from the dev lane
//               so it never needs one", "this is metal-only via Vault") are
//               CLAIMS, and a claim in this repo goes in a file with a lift
//               condition rather than in someone's head.
//
// IT DOES NOT decide whether an Application is applied in the dev lane. That
// question has three sources of truth already -- `DEV_EXCLUDED_REASONS`, the
// root catalogue's `excludeGlob`, and `isExcludedFromIncludedProof`'s rules --
// and a fourth reimplementation of it here would be a copy that drifts. So an
// excluded Application's Secret is carried in the baseline WITH its exclusion
// named, which keeps the two facts in one place and makes the entry go stale the
// day the exclusion lifts.
//
// Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 an unminted Secret or a stale acknowledgement, 2 usage.

/**
 * A key whose VALUE is the name of a Secret this manifest does not create.
 *
 * WIDENED FROM `existingSecret` ALONE, and the narrow version was wrong in the
 * ACQUITTING direction. `oz` names its credential `customAdminSecretName:
 * ziti-admin-credentials` -- a Secret the dev roster really does mint -- and the
 * first pattern here matched none of it. A guard that only recognises ONE
 * spelling does not prevent the class of defect it was built for; it prevents
 * that defect written one particular way, and the next one arrives spelled
 * differently. Found by noticing the minted count was 1 when the roster mints 2.
 *
 * So the rule is the SHAPE of the key, not a fixed vocabulary: anything ending
 * in `existingSecret` or in `secretName` (either case) is a promise that some
 * other actor creates that object.
 *
 * WIDENED A SECOND TIME, 2026-09-05, and by the same failure mode the paragraph
 * above describes -- which is the argument for the shape rule rather than a
 * refutation of it. `opensearch` references its minted admin credential through
 * `extraEnvs[].valueFrom.secretKeyRef.name`, which is the STANDARD Kubernetes
 * way to name a Secret and is arguably more common than either spelling above.
 * The audit did not recognise it, so a genuinely-referenced credential read as
 * "a minted Secret nobody names".
 *
 * `secretKeyRef.name` is matched by its PARENT, not by the key `name` alone: a
 * bare `name:` means a hundred things in a values file, and matching it would
 * convict half the tree. The same applies to `secretRef` (used by `envFrom`),
 * so both are recognised only in that position.
 *
 * WIDENED AGAIN 2026-09-06, `existingSecret` -> `existing<Anything>Secret`. seaweedfs names
 * its Secret in `s3.existingConfigSecret`, and the old pattern did not match it -- the word
 * is `existing`, then `Config`, then `Secret`, so "existingSecret" is not a substring. That
 * reference was INVISIBLE to this audit: a chart naming an unminted Secret in that field
 * would have passed silently, which is the exact failure this file exists to catch, in this
 * file. Found because 081M1S6Z5S3087G0R000GEPSS2 made seaweedfs use that field and the
 * roster then showed two references where three were expected.
 *
 * The widening is bounded on both sides -- it still requires the name to END in `Secret` and
 * to contain `existing` -- so it does not start matching `secretsDir` or `secretEngine`.
 *
 * WIDENED A THIRD TIME, WP24 (081M35K4PV6087G0R001Z3E0P8's sweep): TWO MORE SHAPES, both found
 * by the same method as the two above -- an Application whose credential turned out to have
 * ZERO references in this audit's own output, checked directly with `collectSecretReferences`.
 *
 * (1) A BARE `secret` LEAF. `gitlab/Application.yaml` sets
 * `global.initialRootPassword.secret: gitlab-initial-root-password` (and, identically,
 * `appConfig.object_store.connection.secret` / `registry.storage.secret`, both `zeta-blob-store`)
 * -- three references, ALL invisible, because the leaf is spelled `secret`, not `...Secret` or
 * `secretName`. This is the chart's own convention (paired with a sibling `key:` naming which
 * field inside that Secret to read -- `key` is deliberately NOT matched here, it names a field,
 * not an object) and it is the actual mechanism behind "gitlab-initial-root-password is a known,
 * separately-tracked gap -- never minted at all": the gap was not that nothing minted it, it was
 * that nothing could SEE the reference to check. Matched narrowly -- the leaf must be exactly
 * `secret` (lowercase, no prefix/suffix letters) -- because a broader `[A-Za-z]*[Ss]ecret$` would
 * also match fields that hold a secret VALUE inline (`clientSecret`, `apiSecret`, ...), and
 * flagging those would report a literal as an unminted Secret NAME. Checked against every
 * `Application.yaml` in the tree before landing: `gitlab` is the only source of this shape.
 *
 * (2) `...ConfigSecret`, one word short of `existingConfigSecret` above. `arc-runner-set` names
 * `githubConfigSecret: arc-github-app` -- a NAME reference per its own header comment
 * ("Name reference only. Materialised by external-secrets from Vault."), not prefixed with
 * `existing`, so the second widening above did not reach it either.
