 *
 * DERIVE THE APP-OF-APPS SYNC-WAVE ORDER FROM DECLARED DEPENDENCIES, AND
 * REFUSE WHEN THE HAND-WRITTEN ANNOTATIONS CONTRADICT THE DERIVATION.
 *
 * -- WHAT THIS REPLACES ----------------------------------------------------
 * `full-ai-cluster/dev-cluster/SYNC-WAVES.md` was the only statement of
 * bring-up order and it was maintained by hand. On 2026-08-21 an audit read it
 * as stale: it names 34 components while 46 `kind: Application` manifests ship,
 * so twelve Applications appeared nowhere in its graph.
 *
 * "Stale" was the wrong diagnosis, and the right one is the reason this file
 * exists (Aaron, 2026-08-21): *"for our sync waves, we are supposed to use our
 * ace package manager to calculate the sync waves so the order of the helm
 * charts can be derived where there are dependencies."* Nobody had failed to
 * update a document. A HAND-MAINTAINED artifact was standing where a DERIVED
 * one was intended. Correcting the twelve omissions would have restored the
 * document to accurate-for-now; deriving the order makes the omission
 * IMPOSSIBLE, because an Application absent from the dependency declaration is
 * a refusal rather than a gap nobody can see.
 *
 * -- THE ENGINE IS ace, NOT A REIMPLEMENTATION -----------------------------
 * `src/Core.TypeScript/ace/deps.ts` already carries the whole calculation and
 * says so in its header: "Resolves dependency graphs, calculates topo-sort &
 * sync-waves". `resolveGraph()` does a DFS topological sort with cycle
 * detection and then assigns `wave = 1 + max(wave of dependencies)` -- heights
 * in the DAG. This module calls it. It computes no order of its own.
 *
 * The roster likewise is NOT recomputed here: `listApplicationManifests()` from
 * `app-of-apps-discovery.ts` is the roster, because that module already
 * established -- against the live cluster -- that ArgoCD's include glob is not
 * path-segment bounded and therefore reaches depth 2 (`game-hosting/gmod`).
 *
 * -- WHAT IT ASSERTS -------------------------------------------------------
 * Six findings, each of which is a REFUSAL and never a skip:
 *
 *   1. UNDECLARED    -- an Application in the roster with no node in the
 *                       declaration. This is the exact hole the twelve fell
 *                       through. `dependsOn: []` is an allowed answer; absence
 *                       is not.
 *   2. PHANTOM       -- a declared node naming no shipped Application.
 *   3. UNANNOTATED   -- an Application manifest carrying no
 *                       `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave`.
 *   4. UNCITED-EDGE  -- a `dependsOn` entry with no `citations` entry. A wave
 *                       with no cited dependency is the hand-written document's
 *                       defect wearing a new filename.
 *   5. ORDER         -- a declared edge `dep -> app` where the hand-written
 *                       waves do NOT put `dep` strictly earlier. This is the
 *                       derivation disagreeing with the live cluster.
 *   6. CNI-FLOOR     -- an Application (other than argocd, which self-manages
 *                       first) whose wave is at or below cilium's. Pod
 *                       networking is the precondition for every workload, and
 *                       stating it as one checked invariant is honest where
 *                       restating it as 44 identical edges would be padding.
 *
 * -- WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO --------------------------------------
 * It does not renumber anything. Wave order controls bring-up sequencing on a
 * real cluster; a wrong reorder is a broken bootstrap, and a renumbering nobody
 * reviewed is worse than a reported disagreement. Finding 5 prints the
 * disagreement and the citation that grounds it, and a human adjudicates.
 *
 * Note also what is NOT checked: the derived wave NUMBERS are not compared to
 * the hand-written numbers. ace's heights are 0..N and the live annotations run
 * -90..50; requiring equality would be numerology (a coincidence of counts, not
 * an identification). The defensible claim is that the hand-written assignment
 * must be a LINEAR EXTENSION of the derived partial order -- which is exactly
 * findings 5 and 6.
 *
 * Beacon: Kahn, "Topological sorting of large networks", CACM 5(11) 1962 --
 * the classical construction `resolveGraph` implements.

 * registry is either a red check on `main` (which gets ignored, then deleted)
 * or a silent skip (which is the failure this whole file exists to stop). A
 * registered disagreement is still PRINTED on every run -- visible, not muted
 * -- and:
 *
 *   - a NEW disagreement is not registered, so it FAILS;
 *   - a registration whose disagreement no longer exists is STALE, and that
 *     FAILS too, so the registry cannot rot into a permanent allowlist;
 *   - a reason is mandatory. An entry without one is a mute button.
