//
// NO CHART NAMES A STORAGE PROVIDER. It names a CAPABILITY, and each cluster
// binds the capability to whatever provider it actually runs.
//
// The maintainer, 2026-09-23: "where possible like PVC we should try to have an
// abstraction so no chart is requesting a specific PVC provider, it references
// some class of PVC that's more abstract."
//
// WHAT IT REPLACES. Until this module, 20 class lines across 16 Applications
// wrote `longhorn` and seven more wrote `zeta-local-path` -- a
// provider's product name and a provisioner's binary name. So the dev/CI lane
// could only run them by FAKING the provider: a StorageClass literally named
// `longhorn` bound to `rancher.io/local-path`, guarded by a check that its
// provisioner was NOT Longhorn. That alias was honest about itself, but the
// shape was backwards -- the chart said "Longhorn" and the cluster had to lie
// about what Longhorn was. Here the chart says what it NEEDS and the cluster
// says what it HAS, and neither sentence is false on any substrate.
//
// ── THE CAPABILITIES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Three, and only three. Named for what a workload may rely on, not for how it
// is implemented. Kubernetes has exactly this indirection built in -- a
// StorageClass IS a name bound to a provisioner -- so no new mechanism exists
// here; what is new is refusing to spend the name on the provider.
//
//   zeta-block-replicated  durable RWO block, replicated where the cluster can.
//                          Metal: Longhorn (driver.longhorn.io). Its replica
//                          count follows the node count, which is 1 today
//                          (longhorn/Application.yaml defaultReplicaCount), so
//                          the capability is "as replicated as this cluster
//                          can make it", never a promise of three copies.
//   zeta-block-local       node-local, UNREPLICATED RWO block. Caches, scratch,
//                          and the early-wave workloads that must bind before
//                          Longhorn exists (openbao -60, spire -50). Metal and
//                          dev: rancher.io/local-path. THE CLUSTER DEFAULT.
//   zeta-shared            RWX. Metal: Longhorn's NFSv4 share-manager
//                          (longhorn-prereqs.nix installs nfs-utils for exactly
//                          this). Dev/CI: DELIBERATELY UNBOUND -- local-path is
//                          RWO-only, so an RWX claim there could only hang
//                          Pending; the harness's access-mode rule keeps such
//                          Applications out of the proof instead.
//
// ── WHY THE DEFAULT IS zeta-block-local, NOT zeta-block-replicated ───────────
// The first design made the REPLICATED class the default, so a chart that omits
// a class would still land somewhere durable. The tree argued otherwise, twice:
//
//   1. THE DISK BUDGET. The class-less claims in the render (dapr 48 GiB, gitlab
//      66, loki 20, mimir 6 -- rendered-storage-claims.snapshot.json) total
//      ~140 GiB. The replicated class is the one `budgetedStorageClasses`
//      governs, at 943 GiB on profile `measured` against 1047 GiB usable on the
//      smallest registered node (single-node-budget.json). Defaulting to it
//      moves 140 GiB into that budget: ~1083 GiB, OVER the measured box. The
//      default is not a naming question; it decides which disk a chart that
//      said nothing lands on.
//   2. FIRST BOOT. The default must exist before ArgoCD does. Metal's Longhorn
//      installs at wave -15; anything class-less that syncs earlier would pend
//      against a default whose provisioner is not running yet -- the exact
//      inversion vault/TOPOLOGY.md fact #6 measured. rancher.io/local-path is a
//      k3s auto-deploy manifest and is there from boot.
//
// So the default stays where it was (the local class, formerly
// `zeta-local-path`), renamed to its capability. Moving it is a disk-budget
// decision for a maintainer, and this file says so rather than making it.
//
// ── BINDING MODE: WaitForFirstConsumer, ON BOTH ──────────────────────────────
// Dev and metal are identical here, and the choice is the long-term one rather
// than the convenient one. local-path is node-local, so under `Immediate` it
// would choose a node BEFORE the scheduler does -- wrong on any multi-node
// cluster (the reasoning the old dev `longhorn` alias recorded in its own
// header). For Longhorn it is the topology-aware mode that lets a volume follow
// the node its pod lands on once there is more than one node. Metal's Longhorn
// class was `Immediate` until now; it moves, dev does not. The one cost, stated
// so nobody debugs it cold: a PVC with no consuming pod never binds.
//
// ── THE FALSIFIER ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `auditStorageCapabilities` below, run in the k8s-argocd-health-test plan job.
// It is an ALLOWLIST, not a denylist: every non-empty storageClass value in an
// Application tree or in the committed render must be one of the three names.
// A denylist of provider names would pass the next provider nobody listed.
