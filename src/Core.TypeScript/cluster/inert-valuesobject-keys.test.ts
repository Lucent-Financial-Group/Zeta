/**
 * inert-valuesobject-keys.test.ts — a `valuesObject` key the chart has no
 * schema for is a declaration that governs NOTHING, and reads exactly like one
 * that governs something.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.
 *
 * This tree has now been bitten by the same defect four times, each found by a
 * different route and none of them by a check:
 *
 *   hindsight  `postgresql.primary.persistence.*` — the bitnami subchart layout,
 *              against a chart that ships its own StatefulSet reading
 *              `postgresql.persistence.*`. Declared 10Gi on longhorn; rendered
 *              8Gi with no storageClassName.
 *   nats       a TOP-LEVEL `cluster: {enabled, replicas: 3}`, against a chart
 *              that reads `config.cluster`. Rendered `replicas: 1` — a
 *              single-node JetStream wearing a three-node HA claim.
 *   oz         `adminSecret: {name, key}` — a key ziti-controller has never had
 *              in ANY published version; the real pair is
 *              `useCustomAdminSecret` + `customAdminSecretName`.
 *   headscale  an entire top-level `config:` block — `server_url`,
 *              `listen_addr`, `metrics_listen_addr`, `prefixes` — against a
 *              chart whose values.yaml has six top-level keys and no `config`.
 *              The pod ran with NO server_url from any source and was
 *              CrashLoopBackOff in the included-proof lane.
 *
 * THE FIRST THREE WERE CAUGHT BY A STORAGE CHECK, AND THAT IS THE POINT.
 * `rendered-storage-claims.ts` compares a declared PVC against a rendered one,
 * so it catches an inert key only when that key happens to govern storage.
 * headscale's did not: it governed whether the process could start. Nothing in
 * the repo asked whether a `valuesObject` key exists in the chart's schema at
 * all, which is why the same defect kept arriving wearing different clothes.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS. Two layers, and the second one arrived later.
 *
 * The narrow half — the `describe` blocks for headscale and oz below — pins the
 * SPECIFIC measured facts for the two manifests repaired on 2026-08-22, offline,
 * so a revert cannot be silent. It was written when the general guard did not
 * exist, on the principle that a narrow falsifier that runs beats a broad one
 * that does not, and it is kept: it states things the general guard cannot, such
 * as WHY `env.HEADSCALE_SERVER_URL` is load-bearing only while the Ingress is
 * off.
 *
 * The general half is `inert-valuesobject-keys.ts`, which this file's header
 * used to disclaim: *"the general guard compares every Application's
 * `valuesObject` key set against its pinned chart's `values.yaml`... That is
 * worth building and is not built here."* It is built now, and the tests below
 * §THE GENERAL GUARD hold it to the bar the sentence implies — it goes RED on
 * all four instances as they stood before their fixes, reconstructed from git
 * history rather than paraphrased. It also goes red on two MORE (hindsight's
 * `api.llm` and top-level `service`, found independently in PR #13524), which is
 * the closest thing available to evidence that the class is real rather than
 * fitted to four remembered cases.
