// Inert `valuesObject` keys — does every key an Application declares exist in
// the schema of the chart it is pinned to?
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// An Application's `helm.valuesObject` is a statement of intent that Helm does
// not check. A key the chart has no schema for is not an error, not a warning,
// and not a diff — it is silently discarded, and the manifest goes on reading
// exactly like one that governs something. This tree was bitten by that defect
// FOUR times in one night, each found by a different route and none of them by
// a check:
//
//   hindsight  `postgresql.primary.persistence.*` — the bitnami subchart
//              layout, against a chart that ships its own StatefulSet reading
//              `postgresql.persistence.*`. Postgres landed on node-local disk
//              with `reclaimPolicy: Delete` while the catalogue said longhorn.
//   nats       a TOP-LEVEL `cluster: {enabled, replicas: 3}`, against a chart
//              that reads `config.cluster`. No JetStream quorum: a stream with
//              `replicas > 1` refuses to create.
//   oz         `adminSecret: {name, key}` — a key ziti-controller has never had
//              in any published version.
//   headscale  an entire top-level `config:` block, against a chart whose
//              values.yaml has six top-level keys and no `config`. ZERO
//              occurrences of `server_url` in the render; CrashLoopBackOff.
//
// THE FIRST THREE WERE CAUGHT BY A STORAGE CHECK, AND THAT IS THE POINT.
// `rendered-storage-claims.ts` compares a declared PVC against a rendered one,
// so it catches an inert key only when that key happens to govern storage.
// headscale's governed whether the process could start, and nothing would have
// caught it. The guard that catches all four is the one this module is:
// compare every Application's `valuesObject` key set against its pinned
// chart's schema.
//
// THE HARD PART IS FALSE POSITIVES, NOT TRUE POSITIVES
// ----------------------------------------------------
// A naive key-set comparison against the parent chart's `values.yaml` cries
// wolf on nearly every app in this tree, and a guard that cries wolf gets
// disabled — which is strictly worse than no guard. Four sources of legitimate
// keys absent from a parent `values.yaml`, all measured in this tree:
//
//   SUBCHARTS       `postgresql.auth.database` is valid for headscale because
//                   headscale declares a postgresql dependency; the key lives
//                   in the SUBCHART's values.yaml under the dependency's name
//                   (or its `alias`). Resolved from `Chart.yaml` + `charts/`.
//   LIBRARY CHARTS  headscale's own values.yaml has six top-level keys, and the
//                   Application legitimately sets `persistence.config.accessMode`
//                   — because `bjw-s.common` is `type: library`, its templates
//                   are evaluated in the PARENT's scope, so its `.Values.x` is
//                   the parent's `x`. A library subchart contributes its schema
//                   at the parent's prefix, not under its own name. Getting
//                   this wrong would flag most of headscale's working values.
//   CONDITIONAL     `ingress.main.hosts[].host` is read only under
//                   `ingress.main.enabled`. Absent from a default render is not
//                   absent from the chart, so acceptance is read from the
//                   TEMPLATES' literal `.Values.a.b.c` references as well as
//                   from the default tree — a path the chart names anywhere is
//                   a path the chart has.
//   OPEN MAPS       `env`, `podAnnotations`, `persistence` (keyed by an
//                   arbitrary item name), `extraObjects`. A key under one of
//                   these is not inert BY DEFINITION: the chart consumes the
//                   whole node. Detected from the chart's own text — a `range`
//                   over the node, a `toYaml` of it, a binding of it to a
//                   variable, or an empty-map default — never from a hardcoded
//                   list of key names, which would be a second schema free to
//                   drift from the charts.
//
// UNDECIDABLE IS A FINDING, NEVER A PASS
// --------------------------------------
// Some charts reach `.Values` dynamically — `index .Values $name`, a range over
// the root — and for those, no key set can be derived and no key can be called
// inert. Some charts cannot be fetched at all. Neither is a pass: an app that
// could not be checked is reported as UNDECIDABLE with its reason, and
// UNDECIDABLE counts toward the exit code exactly like an inert key. The
// precedent is `snapshot-coverage-stale` in the reason-truth work, and the
// failure it prevents is the one this repo names most often: a check that did
// not run wearing the face of one that passed.
//
// OFFLINE BY SNAPSHOT, same split as `rendered-storage-claims.ts`
// --------------------------------------------------------------
// Deriving a schema needs `helm pull`, the network, and an upstream still
// serving the pinned tag. Three ways to be unavailable, and an unavailable gate
// is skipped, and a skipped gate reads like a passing one. So the SCHEMA is
// measured, dated, pinned and checked in as text; the CHECK compares our own
// manifests against it offline and deterministically. Editing a manifest
// without re-measuring goes red in CI with no network at all, and
// `--check-snapshot` re-derives live and refuses drift so the snapshot cannot
// become a comfortable fiction that outlives the charts it describes.
