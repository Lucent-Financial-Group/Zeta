// PER-RUNG FIELD OVERRIDES — the second override point, and the reason it exists.
//
// `applyResourceProfile` writes exactly two fields per claim:
// `<requestsField>.cpu` and `<requestsField>.memory`. Until this file, that was
// the ONLY way the dev lane could differ from the committed `metal` tree. So an
// Application whose dev/metal difference is anything other than a cpu or memory
// number had no expressible dev form, and the only remaining move was to
// exclude it from the lane entirely -- which is how twelve Applications ended up
// never reaching a CI cluster at all.
//
// Aaron 2026-09-04, on finding that out:
//
//   "i'd like to include all those others dev included if possible too, this is
//    what i want to know what is CI tested, metal is just for hardware and
//    hopeuflly they just diverge between dev and metal is disk, cpu, memory,
//    etc... request maybe replica counts but i'd love to try to test everyting
//    in CI"
//
// and, on the GPU specifically: "yes on real metal we can add any gpu selectors".
//
// That is the design in his words: **dev and metal differ in SIZING and in what
// the substrate physically has, never in whether the Application exists.** A
// GitHub runner has no GPU; the 16-core box does. That is a substrate fact, and
// it should cost one override rather than a whole Application's CI coverage.
//
// ── IT WRITES THE STAGED TREE, NEVER THE COMMITTED ONE ────────────────────────
// Same contract as the rung: `lane-tree-source` stages a COPY of
// `full-ai-cluster/k8s`, applies the rung to it, serves it from an in-cluster
// git server, and throws the copy away. Nothing here touches what a maintainer
// committed, so the hardware box keeps `metal` unchanged.
//
// ── EVERY OVERRIDE MUST DO SOMETHING, AND THAT IS ENFORCED ────────────────────
// An override that changes nothing is the vacuity class wearing a config file:
// it reads as coverage and buys none. So `applyRungOverrides` REFUSES an
// override that produces zero edits -- a `set` whose value the tree already has,
// or a `delete` of a path that is not there. Both mean the override has drifted
// from the manifest it claims to patch, and both are silent by default.
