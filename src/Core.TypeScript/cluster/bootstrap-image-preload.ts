 *
 * THE BOOTSTRAP IMAGE PRELOAD SET — which container images must be ON THE USB
 * STICK for a first boot to reach ArgoCD-landed with no registry reachable,
 * derived from the real `services.k3s.manifests` roster and never from a list.
 * 081M3BZ111D087G0R000YBMKRY (WP34).
 *
 * -- WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. READ THIS FIRST. -----------------------------
 * This makes the cluster COME UP without a registry. It does NOT make the
 * roster CONVERGE offline.
 *
 * The first-boot external-dependency inventory (#17670, 081M3BWJ96T087G0R0028WT3S3)
 * measured 134 container images across EIGHT registries, of which the
 * pull-through cache covers ONE (docker.io, via mirror.gcr.io — 48 of 134,
 * 36%). This module covers the ~25 the BOOTSTRAP roster needs. The remaining
 * ~109 are the ArgoCD catalog, and they still pull from quay.io, ghcr.io,
 * registry.gitlab.com, registry.k8s.io and the rest, at whatever per-source-IP
 * budget the operator's NAT shares with strangers.
 *
 * So the improvement is precisely this, and nothing more: a registry outage or
 * a spent rate limit DELAYS THE ROSTER instead of BRICKING THE INSTALL. The
 * operator gets a running cluster with ArgoCD visibly reconciling and visibly
 * behind, rather than a partially provisioned node whose only explanation is a
 * stack location. Claiming an offline install would be worse than not doing
 * this.
 *
 * -- WHY THE BOOTSTRAP SLICE IS THE RIGHT SLICE, MEASURED ----------------
 * The whole roster is ~28.8 GB compressed / ~77 GB unpacked
 * (`image-footprint.ts`) — not an ISO. The bootstrap slice measures ~1.02 GB
 * compressed / ~2.7 GB unpacked at the x2.67 ratio `storage-profiles.json`
 * measured, and it is not an arbitrary cut:
 *
 *   - It is the seven charts the installed-disk verdict already asserts —
 *     cilium, cert-manager, spire, trust-manager, external-secrets, argocd,
 *     plus the local-path provisioner — i.e. the difference between "the
 *     machine boots and nothing happens" and "the cluster is up".
 *   - MEASURED 2026-09-25: every image in it except busybox, the two kubectls
 *     and argocd's redis sits on an UNMIRRORED registry — quay.io (11),
 *     ghcr.io (5), registry.k8s.io (2), cgr.dev (1), ecr-public (1). The
 *     bootstrap set is almost exactly the part of the 134 the mirror does not
 *     cover, which is why 1 GB here buys more than 1 GB anywhere else.
 *
 * -- k3s's OWN IMAGES: ONE IS IN, THE REST ARE NOT, AND A CLAIM IS CORRECTED
 * An earlier version of this header said k3s's built-ins "ship inside the k3s
 * release image and are in containerd before the agent starts". THAT WAS
 * WRONG, and it was wrong in the way this whole work item is about: it was
 * inferred from `ctr images ls` on a booted container, where the images were
 * present because they had just been PULLED. Measured directly afterwards,
 * `rancher/k3s:v1.35.7-k3s1` has no `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/images/` and
 * ships no airgap tarball at all. The falsifier is what caught it.
 *
 * So: the SANDBOX (pause) image IS in this set, derived from the pinned k3s
 * binary by `deriveSandboxImage`, because without it a node cannot start a
 * single pod — including the pods whose own images are preloaded. 0.3 MB, and
 * the best ratio in the payload.
 *
 * `mirrored-coredns-coredns`, `mirrored-metrics-server`, `klipper-lb` and
 * `klipper-helm` are still out. They ARE pulled at first boot, and that is now
 * stated rather than denied — but they are all `docker.io/rancher/*`, i.e. the
 * one registry the mirror covers, and each supports a service that degrades
 * rather than a node that cannot run. Preloading them is a separate ~150 MB
 * decision with a ready mechanism (nixpkgs exposes the official airgap tarball
 * as `k3s.airgapImages`), and it is not made here.
 *
 * -- DERIVED, NEVER LISTED ------------------------------------------------
 * A second hand-maintained copy of a roster is a defect class this repo has
 * paid for repeatedly, so nothing here is spelled out:
 *
 *   `buildRoster()`        (first-boot-replica.ts) — parses
 *                          `services.k3s.manifests` out of k3s-server.nix AND
 *                          local-storage.nix's inline `pkgs.writeText` entry,
 *                          and throws on any shape it cannot see.
 *   `parseHelmChartCrs()`  (render-first-boot-charts.ts) — the HelmChart CRs.
 *   `imagesInDocuments()`  (image-footprint.ts) — every `image:` in a tree.
 *   `measureImage()`       (image-footprint.ts) — the ONE sizer. Not a second.
 *
 * The roster is read through `buildRoster`, so the tree's SECOND, legacy
 * bootstrap directory is excluded automatically and correctly: nothing in the
 * NixOS roster references it, so nothing on a first boot pulls it. That is a
 * consequence of deriving rather than listing — a hand-written set would have
 * had to remember to leave it out.
 *
 * -- VERIFY EARLIER, NOT LESS --------------------------------------------
 * The snapshot pins each image to the DIGEST its linux/amd64 manifest resolved
 * to at refresh time. `--verify` re-resolves every one before an archive is
 * built, so an image that moved under its tag is caught in CI — where there
 * are credentials, no rate limit worth worrying about, and a human reading a
 * red build — rather than on an operator's first boot. The archive is then
 * pulled BY DIGEST, so what ships is what was verified.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/bootstrap-image-preload.ts --list
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/bootstrap-image-preload.ts --refresh
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/bootstrap-image-preload.ts --report
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/bootstrap-image-preload.ts --verify
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/bootstrap-image-preload.ts --build-archive --out <path>
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 = ok; 1 = a finding (drift, a digest that moved, a failed
 * pull); 2 = usage/environment error (helm missing, roster unparseable).

 * The SANDBOX (pause) image k3s pulls before it can start ANY pod.
 *
 * THIS SECTION CORRECTS A CLAIM I MADE AND SHOULD NOT HAVE. An earlier version
 * of this module stated that k3s's own built-ins "ship inside the k3s release
 * image and are in containerd before the agent starts", citing `ctr images ls`
 * on a booted container. That observation was real and the inference was wrong:
 * the images were there because they had just been PULLED. Measured directly:
 * `rancher/k3s:v1.35.7-k3s1` has no `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/images/` at all
 * and ships no airgap tarball anywhere in its filesystem.
 *
 * What made it visible was the falsifier, and only the falsifier. With docker.io
 * blackholed, all twenty-five probes sat in `ContainerCreating` for twelve
 * minutes:
 *
 *     Failed to create pod sandbox: failed to get sandbox image
 *     "rancher/mirrored-pause:3.10.2": ... dial tcp 127.0.0.1:443: connect:
 *     connection refused
 *
 * So the sandbox image is the single most load-bearing image on the node —
 * WITHOUT IT NOTHING RUNS, including the pods whose own images are preloaded —
 * and a preload that omitted it would have produced a node that still could not
 * start a container. It is 0.3 MB. It is the best ratio in the entire payload.
 *
 * DERIVED FROM THE PINNED k3s IMAGE, not written down: the tag is read out of
 * the k3s binary itself, so it follows `kubernetes-version.json` with no second
 * pin to drift. Fully qualified on purpose — CRI normalises the sandbox
 * reference to `docker.io/...` before looking it up, so that is the name the
 * archive must carry.
 *
 * A failure to derive it THROWS. It must never be silently absent: an archive
 * missing the sandbox image is an archive that looks complete and produces a
 * node that cannot run a single pod.

/**
 * What to fetch, and under what name.
 *
 * THE NAME IS THE LOAD-BEARING HALF, AND IT WAS MEASURED THE HARD WAY.
 * containerd resolves a pod's `image:` string against its own image store, so
 * an archive whose entries differ from the rendered reference is an archive the
 * kubelet ignores entirely — a preload that silently does nothing, which is the
 * exact failure class this whole effort exists to refuse.
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-09-25, k3s v1.35.7+k3s1 in Docker with quay.io blackholed to
 * 127.0.0.1: an archive built with `skopeo copy ... oci:<dir>:<ref>` carried a
 * PLAIN TAG correctly — kubelet logged "already present on machine" — and did
 * NOT carry a `repo:tag@sha256:...` reference, which went ImagePullBackOff on
 * `dial tcp 127.0.0.1:443`.
 *
 * The cause is exact, and worth writing down because it is invisible from the
 * tarball. An OCI-layout destination forces OCI media types, so skopeo REWRITES
 * an `application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.list.v2+json` index into an
 * OCI index — new bytes, new digest. The kubelet normalises `repo:tag@sha256:X`
 * to `repo@sha256:X` and asks containerd for content with digest X. X is the
 * INDEX digest; what the archive held was the rewritten index, or with
 * `--override-arch amd64` only the amd64 CHILD. Neither is X, so containerd
 * goes to the network. `--preserve-digests` does not rescue it: skopeo refuses
 * the conversion rather than performing it, so the index cannot be written at
 * all.
 *
 * That is FIVE of the twenty-five images — every cilium one, 389 MB, 38% of the
 * payload, and the single chart without which nothing else schedules. A preload
 * built the obvious way would have shipped, looked right, imported cleanly, and
 * left the CNI pulling from a registry on every first boot.
 *
 * So the archive is assembled BYTE-FOR-BYTE from the registry instead, by
 * `buildArchive` below: the index manifest is written exactly as served, which
 * preserves its digest by construction. Re-measured the same day against the
 * same blackhole: the digest-pinned pod reached `Succeeded`.
 */
/**
 * The name to put in the archive — the rendered reference, except when it has
 * no tag at all.
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-09-25, and it took down the whole archive rather than one
 * image. `local-storage.nix`'s helper pod names `busybox` bare, and k3s's
 * importer refuses it outright:
 *
 *     failed to import .../zeta-bootstrap-images.tar: failed to retag images:
 *     failed to parse tag for image busybox: can't cast reference.repository
 *     to NamedTagged
 *
 * k3s retags every entry as it imports, and a reference with no tag and no
 * digest is not a `NamedTagged`, so the retag pass errors and the import does
 * not complete. ONE untagged entry therefore costs all twenty-five — which is
 * why this normalisation is not cosmetic.
 *
 * The canonical form is what the kubelet will ask for anyway: CRI normalises a
 * pod's `image: busybox` to `docker.io/library/busybox:latest` before looking
 * it up, so naming the archive entry that way is naming it what the lookup
 * uses. Everything that already carries a tag or a digest is left VERBATIM,
 * because verbatim is what was measured to work and a normalisation applied
 * where it is not needed is a chance to be wrong.
