 *
 * 081KSXN940008QG0R000SCP2H1 - Kubernetes + ArgoCD health integration harness.
 *
 * This is the cluster-health lane carved away from the 081KSNY2Z0008QG0R0008PN7RQ USB/ISO
 * zflash harness. It proves a real local Kubernetes cluster can reconcile
 * the Zeta GitOps substrate to ArgoCD Application health, while zflash keeps
 * owning boot/reformat/key-retention semantics.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/argocd-health-test.ts --dry-run
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/argocd-health-test.ts --preflight
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/argocd-health-test.ts --run --provider kind --git-ref main
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/argocd-health-test.ts --run --provider k3d --git-ref main
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/argocd-health-test.ts --run --existing --cluster-name zeta-dev
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 - dry-run/preflight/run succeeded
 *   1 - health check failed after a cluster was reachable
 *   2 - usage error or named dependency/preflight failure

 * There are TWO independent lists governing this lane and nothing used to keep

 *
 *   1. WHAT ARGOCD APPLIES  - `DEFAULT_ROOT_DEV_CATALOG.excludeGlob` (ports.ts).
 *      Ground truth: a directory named there never reaches the CI cluster.
 *   2. WHAT THE HARNESS ASSERTS - `DEV_EXCLUDED_DIRS` +
 *      `DEV_INCLUDED_PROOF_DEFERRED_DIRS` + the derived "references
 *      `storageClass: longhorn`" rule, via `isExcludedFromIncludedProof`.
 *
 * The difference between them is a SHADOW: Applications that are applied to
 * every CI cluster and asserted by nothing. Measured on 2026-08-16 it was 14
 * directories wide, and it contained most of the stateful core of the hardware
 * PoC (cockroachdb, vault, nats, redis, spire, ...). `cockroachdb` cannot even
 * sync in that lane - it wants `storageClass: longhorn`, and `longhorn` is
 * glob-excluded, so the StorageClass never exists and the Application hangs
 * `Missing` forever while the harness reports `ok: true`.
 *
 * The shadow is not a bug on its own - deferring an Application is legitimate.
 * The bug is that the deferral was IMPLICIT, so it could grow silently. This
 * registry makes each one explicit and REASONED, and
 * `auditAppliedButUnasserted` goes red the moment the two lists drift apart in
 * either direction: a newly-applied Application nobody asserted, or a stale
 * entry here for a directory that no longer exists.
 *
 * Adding an entry is cheap and honest; adding one WITHOUT a reason is refused.

/**
 * THE ASSERTION SPLIT (2026-08-21).
 *
 * A declared manual-sync Application is asserted DIFFERENTLY, never skipped --
 * see ./manual-sync-policy.ts for the convention, the weaker contract, and what
 * that contract can and cannot still catch.
 *
 * Fail-closed twice over: expected.manualSync is true only for a WELL-FORMED
 * declaration (annotation + non-empty reason + no automated block), so a
 * malformed one keeps the full Synced+Healthy contract. Adding an app name to a
 * list is not a way in; the app has to say why, in its own manifest.
