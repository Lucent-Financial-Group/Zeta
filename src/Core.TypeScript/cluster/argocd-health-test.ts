 *
 * 081KSXN940008QG0R000SCP2H1 - Kubernetes + ArgoCD health integration harness.
 *
 * This is the cluster-health lane carved away from the 081KSNY2Z0008QG0R0008PN7RQ USB/ISO
 * zflash harness. It proves a real local Kubernetes cluster can reconcile
 * the Zeta GitOps substrate to ArgoCD Application health, while zflash keeps
 * owning boot/reformat/key-retention semantics.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/argocd-health-test.ts --dry-run
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/argocd-health-test.ts --preflight
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/argocd-health-test.ts --run --provider kind --git-ref main
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/argocd-health-test.ts --run --provider kind --cni cilium --scope included --git-ref main
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/argocd-health-test.ts --run --provider k3d --git-ref main
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/argocd-health-test.ts --run --existing --cluster-name zeta-dev
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 - dry-run/preflight/run succeeded
 *   1 - health check failed after a cluster was reachable
 *   2 - usage error or named dependency/preflight failure

 * the check stays so the property is asserted rather than merely arranged. It
 * DOES fire on a reason with no `LIFTS WHEN:` clause, which is the failure mode
 * that survives the derivation: a sentence that explains and commits to nothing.
 *
 * THE TWO GLOB DIRECTIONS WERE MISSING, AND THAT WAS THE HOLE
 * (081M0M9TRQ8087G0R000CS3F1X). This registry's own header says it describes
 * "Applications the dev/CI lane neither applies nor asserts", and the thing
 * that decides what the lane applies is `DEFAULT_ROOT_DEV_CATALOG.excludeGlob`
 * in `ports.ts` -- which this function never read. So the registry was checked
 * against the filesystem and against itself, and never against the list that
 * actually defers. Measured 2026-08-21 on `main`: the glob excluded NINE
 * directories and the registry reasoned about FIVE. `agent-memory`, `gitlab`,
 * `platform` and `temporal` were excluded from every CI cluster with no
 * recorded why and no lift condition, and both audit directions were green.
 *
 * That is the same vacuity the registry was built to remove, one list over: a
 * check that cannot fail is not a check. `platform` is the instance that
 * exposed it -- its only recorded reason was a source comment claiming its two
 * images were served by no registry, which was FALSE (see the corrected reason
 * in the map above), and no audit could notice because no audit looked.
 *
 * THE HONEST LIMIT, AND IT IS NOT SMALL: all four directions check that a
 * reason is PRESENT and names a lift condition. NONE of them checks that the
 * reason is TRUE. Nothing here can, and the proof arrived immediately -- the
 * `temporal` reason written in #13472 was refuted by #13469 in the interval
 * between measuring it and merging it, and this audit stayed green through
 * both, because a false sentence with a `LIFTS WHEN:` clause satisfies every
 * mechanical property it has. What the registry buys is that a reason is
 * WRITTEN DOWN and therefore refutable by a reader; what it cannot buy is the
 * reading. Reasons citing a render, a run id or an HTTP status are cheap to
 * re-check on purpose -- that is the mitigation, and it is a convention, not

 * Six of these carried no recorded reason at all until 2026-08-21; the reasons
 * below were established FROM the manifests and are written up in
 * `docs/research/2026-08-21-what-each-deferred-argocd-application-needs-to-boot.md`.
 *
 * `orleans` LEFT this set on 2026-08-21: every resource it declares reconciles
 * on a bare kind cluster, and its StatefulSet ships `replicas: 0`, which
 * gitops-engine's `getAppsv1StatefulSetHealth` reports Healthy (`ReadyReplicas
 * 0 < Replicas 0` is false, and the API-server-defaulted RollingUpdate
 * partition is 0 so `UpdatedReplicas 0 < 0 - 0` is false too). It was deferred
 * for a silo image it never pulls.
 *
 * TWO OF THE FOUR MEASURED DEFERRALS LEFT this set on 2026-08-21, and each
 * left because its DEFECT WAS FIXED -- never because the assertion was
 * weakened. They are asserted under the same full auto-sync contract as every
 * other member of the roster:
 *
 *   `cockroachdb`           -- the chart's own `cockroachdb-init` Job carries
 *      `helm.sh/hook: post-install`, which ArgoCD maps to PostSync, which runs
 *      only after the Sync phase is HEALTHY, which cannot happen until init has
 *      run. The Application now names `argocd.argoproj.io/hook: Sync` on that
 *      Job (gitops-engine `Types()`: "we ignore Helm hooks if we have Argo
 *      hook"), so the Job runs alongside the StatefulSet it unblocks.
 *   `kube-prometheus-stack` -- Grafana's `admin.existingSecret` is now MINTED
 *      per dev cluster by `applyDevBootstrapSecrets`, and
 *      `assertDevBootstrapSecretsPresent` below refuses an included run whose
 *      cluster does not have it.
 *   `oz` -- deferred 2026-08-22 and lifted the same day. Its two blockers were
 *      a trust-manager `Bundle` whose source Secret lived in a namespace
 *      trust-manager was not pointed at, and the SAME missing-admin-Secret
 *      shape as Grafana's. Both are closed at their source rather than waived;
 *      the record sits where the deferral used to, in
 *      DEV_INCLUDED_PROOF_DEFERRED_DIRS.
 *
 * `weaviate` was in that list for a few hours on 2026-08-21 and IS NOT NOW. The
 * live run refuted it: two `type: LoadBalancer` Services can never be Healthy on
 * a kind node, which no amount of sync convergence changes. It is deferred below
 * on that measurement, and that episode is why this paragraph says TWO.
 *
 * `hindsight` stays, with a reason that now names three independent blockers
 * instead of one -- see APPLIED_BUT_UNASSERTED_REASONS.

  // contract, which is the #13084 vacuity this deferral was protecting against.
  //

  // dev/CI (see argocd-health-test.ts's `gitlab` entry in `DEV_EXCLUDED_REASONS`
  // for the full trace). Chart size alone is what keeps this entry.

  // `headscale` is NOT here. It LEFT this set on 2026-08-22 after ONE cycle, and

  //
  //   WAS: applied and asserted for the first time by #13471 (before that it
  //   could not even render), and immediately found CrashLoopBackOff with 12
  //   restarts. Root cause, measured by rendering the Application against its
  //   own valuesObject: the entire `config:` block was INERT -- headscale 0.4.0
  //   has no top-level `config` key and the render carried ZERO occurrences of
  //   `server_url`, while the chart emits HEADSCALE_SERVER_URL only under
  //   `ingress.main.enabled`. The container ran with no server_url from any
  //   source. Fixed in #13550 by moving the value to the chart's own `env:` path.
  //
  //   IT WAS DEFERRED ANYWAY, on purpose: the repair was verified to RENDER and
  //   not to make the pod HEALTHY (no container runtime on the host that wrote
  //   it), and asserting a repair nobody ran is the failure this lane refuses.
  //
  //   CLOSED BY MEASUREMENT, run 32553963034 on `98c66c6cb8`:
  //     === headscale: sync=Unknown health=Healthy
  //         PersistentVolumeClaim/headscale-config: Healthy
  //         Service/headscale:                      Healthy
  //         Deployment/headscale:                   Healthy
  //   A 12-restart CrashLoopBackOff became a Healthy Deployment across exactly
  //   one manifest change, which is a state change rather than a timing flake.
  //
  //   AND THE EXIT CONDITION I WROTE WAS SLIGHTLY WRONG, which is worth more
  //   than the entry was. It said "prints `sync=Synced health=Healthy`". The
  //   lane does not require Synced: `argocd`, `cert-manager`, `external-secrets`,
  //   `headlamp`, `loki` and `node-feature-discovery` are all asserted
  //   at `sync=Unknown health=Healthy` in the same passing run -- `Unknown` here
  //   is an ArgoCD ComparisonError on the diff, not a sync failure. A LIFTS WHEN
  //   stricter than the gate it names would have kept this deferral alive after
  //   its defect was gone, which is the exact shape of the acknowledgement that
  //   outlives its cause.
  // MEASURED 2026-08-21: hindsight-postgresql-0 FailedScheduling "Insufficient
  // cpu" on the 1-node runner; api + control-plane CrashLoop waiting on it.
  // THREE independent blockers now, only the first of which is capacity -- see
  // APPLIED_BUT_UNASSERTED_REASONS, which carries the finding that this
  // Application's valuesObject is written against a chart schema hindsight
  // 0.3.0 does not have, so almost none of it takes effect.
  "hindsight",
  // `orleans` is NOT here: main established by measurement that its
  // `replicas: 0` StatefulSet reaches Synced+Healthy, and removed it. Recorded
  // so the deferral is not reinstated by a future merge.
  //
  // CORRECTED 2026-08-21 (081M0M9TRQ8087G0R000CS3F1X). This comment used to end
  // "runs two images NO REGISTRY SERVES", and that clause was false. Both
  // images are built and pushed by `.github/workflows/build-platform-images.yml`
  // on every push to main touching their paths, and both GHCR packages exist
  // with 36 versions each, last updated the same morning this was written. What
  // is true is that the packages are PRIVATE and no pod spec in full-ai-cluster
  // declares `imagePullSecrets`, so an anonymous pull takes HTTP 401 while a
  // credentialed one takes HTTP 200. The full measurement, and why the two read
  // differently for anyone deciding what to do about it, is the `platform` entry
  // in DEV_EXCLUDED_REASONS -- which is where this Application's reason now
  // lives, because `platform/**` is in `DEFAULT_ROOT_DEV_CATALOG.excludeGlob`
  // and that registry is the one the glob audit checks.
  //
  // Still true, and independent: it renders `monitoring.coreos.com/v1`
  // ServiceMonitor + PrometheusRule (CRDs owned by kube-prometheus-stack, which
  // IS asserted here as of 2026-08-21, so this half no longer stands on its
  // own) and a `gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1` Gateway, and portal.yaml pins
  // `storageClassName: longhorn`.
  "platform",
  // `oz` (openziti-controller) is NOT here. It LEFT this set on 2026-08-22,
  // hours after it entered, and both blockers are recorded as CLOSED rather
  // than the lines silently deleted -- the same treatment `spire` gets below.
  //
  //   WAS: "(1) THE TRUST BUNDLE CANNOT RESOLVE ... `MountVolume.SetUp failed
  //   for volume \"ziti-controller-ctrl-plane-cas\": configmap
  //   \"ziti-controller-ctrl-plane-cas\" not found` ... trust-manager resolves
  //   Bundle secret sources from ITS OWN trust namespace, and ours is pinned to
  //   `cert-manager`, while the certificate that mints that secret is issued
  //   into `openziti`. (2) THE ADMIN CREDENTIAL IS OPERATOR-SUPPLIED BY DESIGN,
  //   and CI has no source for it."
  //
  //   BLOCKER 1 CLOSED BY: k8s/applications/trust-manager/Application.yaml +
  //   k8s/bootstrap/trust-manager-install.yaml, both now
  //   `app.trust.namespace: openziti`. The old reason said the fix was "a
  //   wiring decision between two charts", and it was -- but the wiring is not
  //   ours to choose: at the pinned trust-manager v0.15.0 the Bundle CRD's only
  //   served version offers NO per-source namespace, `deployment.yaml:86` takes
  //   a single `--trust-namespace`, and `role.yaml` grants Secret reads in that
  //   namespace ALONE, so the trust namespace is an RBAC boundary and not a
  //   default. ziti-controller's own README:33 states the requirement in the
  //   same words ("You must set the Trust Manager's 'trust namespace' to the
  //   namespace of the Ziti controller"). The cost is named where it is paid:
  //   the trust namespace is a cluster-wide singleton and openziti is now
  //   spending it, which is affordable only because `kind: Bundle` appears
  //   nowhere else in this tree and `defaultPackage.enabled` is false.
  //
  //   BLOCKER 2 CLOSED BY: `DEV_ZITI_ADMIN_SECRET` in dev-cluster/lib.ts, minted
  //   per cluster by `applyDevBootstrapSecrets` -- the SAME mechanism that
  //   closed Grafana's, one Application over, and NOT a new one. The manifest's
  //   intent is unchanged: `useCustomAdminSecret: true` stays, because the
  //   alternative is worse rather than merely different. MEASURED 2026-08-22:
  //   with `useCustomAdminSecret: false`, two `helm template` runs of the same
  //   chart against the same values differ in `admin-password` -- the chart
  //   builds it from `lookup` with a `randAlphaNum 32` fallback, ArgoCD's
  //   repo-server has no cluster for `lookup` to hit, and `selfHeal: true`
  //   would then rotate the controller's admin credential every reconcile.
  //
  //   AND THE `LIFTS WHEN` IT SATISFIES IS THE ONE THAT WAS WRITTEN: "(1) the
  //   Bundle's source secret and trust-manager's trust namespace are made to
  //   meet -- either trust-manager is given `openziti` in scope ... AND (2) the
  //   lane is given a `ziti-admin-credentials` Secret ... Both, not either."
  //   Both, and the first disjunct of each. A deferral whose stated condition is
  //   met and which stays anyway is the acknowledgement that outlives its cause.
  // `spire` is NOT here. It LEFT this set on 2026-08-22, and both blockers that
  // held it are recorded as CLOSED rather than the lines silently deleted.
  //
  //   WAS (corrected 2026-08-21 from an older reason that was stale on both
  //   halves -- it blamed a Vault upstream-CA dependency that does not exist and
  //   a kind PVC gap this lane already serves):
  //     "1. No `spire-crds` source in the ArgoCD/kind lane. Chart 0.24.2 ships
  //      no `crds/` and no `spire-crds` dependency, yet renders 3
  //      ClusterSPIFFEID resources. 2. The chart's `pre-upgrade` hook Job --
  //      DERIVED, not observed."
  //
  //   BLOCKER 1 CLOSED BY: full-ai-cluster/k8s/applications/spire-crds/
  //   Application.yaml -- the same spire-crds 0.5.0 chart the k3s bootstrap
  //   installs, at sync-wave -55, with the edge `spire -> spire-crds` DECLARED
  //   in sync-wave-dependency-graph.yaml so derive-sync-waves.ts refuses if the
  //   ordering ever stops being a linear extension. The ordering is declared,
  //   not timed.
  //
  //   BLOCKER 2 CONFIRMED, THEN CLOSED. It was recorded as a derivation because
  //   blocker 1 aborted the sync before it could fire. With blocker 1 fixed it
  //   fired exactly as derived, and is now OBSERVED (kind + argo-cd 2.13.2,
  //   2026-08-22): five `spire-server-pre-upgrade` pods in Error with
  //     Error from server (NotFound): validatingwebhookconfigurations
  //     .admissionregistration.k8s.io
  //     "spire-spire-controller-manager-webhook" not found
  //   and the Application pinned at `waiting for completion of hook
  //   batch/Job/spire-server-pre-upgrade` with zero workload pods. Closed with
  //   the chart's own documented setting for template-rendering consumers,
  //   `global.installAndUpgradeHooks.enabled: false`.
  //
  //   A THIRD blocker was found only because the first two were fixed, and it
  //   was invisible behind them: `ServerSideApply=true` makes the spire-server
  //   StatefulSet permanently OutOfSync on a `volumeClaimTemplates` artifact
  //   ArgoCD's own `ignoreDifferences` cannot reach. The 2x2 is measured in the
  //   Application. This is the weaviate lesson applied in advance -- one
  //   confirmed cause is not THE cause -- and it is why the verification below
  //   is a clean-slate run rather than a patch on the cluster that found it.
  //
  //   PROVEN, clean cluster, both Applications applied together so nothing
  //   depended on hand-timing: spire-crds Synced/Healthy, spire Synced/Healthy,
  //   spire-server 2/2, spire-agent 1/1, spire-spiffe-csi-driver 2/2, all three
  //   ClusterSPIFFEIDs bound, and -- past what ArgoCD can tell you -- one agent
  //   attested `k8s_psat` holding
  //   `spiffe://zeta.local/spire/agent/k8s_psat/zeta/...` with 7 registration
  //   entries issued.
  // go.temporal.io/temporal 0.59.0 with `cassandra.enabled: false` and no
  // `server.config.persistence` override: the chart is left with NO datastore,
  // so the schema-setup job has nothing to migrate against. The commented-out
  // CockroachDB wiring is the missing half -- and as of 2026-08-21 the reason it
  // is commented out has changed: cockroachdb now reaches Synced+Healthy in this
  // lane, so the blocker is the unwritten `server.config.persistence` block
  // alone, not an unavailable datastore. That is the next one to close, and it
  // is a manifest change nobody has made rather than a substrate gap.
  "temporal",
  // `vault` is NOT here. It LEFT this set on 2026-08-21, and the condition that
  // lifted it is recorded rather than the line silently deleted.
  //
  //   WAS: "comes up SEALED by design; readiness needs the gated operator-init
  //   ceremony CI must not run -- `vault operator init` + `unseal` MINT root and
  //   unseal key material, a gated class (vault/Application.yaml, TOPOLOGY.md).
  //   Not a wiring gap: a lane that could make Vault Healthy would be a lane
  //   that performs the ceremony, and it must not."
  //
  //   LIFTED BY: the maintainer authorising the EPHEMERAL case on 2026-08-20 --
  //   "if we init key materials and throw it away not a bit deal". The old
  //   reason's last sentence is still true for the METAL cluster and
  //   vault/TOPOLOGY.md section 5 is unchanged: that ceremony is still a human
  //   one, behind the biometric gate. What changed is that a kind cluster
  //   destroyed at the end of the run is not custody, so the lane may perform
  //   the same procedure there. `./ephemeral-vault-init.ts` is that lane, its
  //   gate refuses `--existing`, and its leak scan runs holding the material.
  // MEASURED live, run 32532470499 -- and NOT the reason this Application was
  // deferred for earlier on 2026-08-21, which is exactly why it is back.
  //
  // weaviate renders TWO `type: LoadBalancer` Services (`weaviate`,
  // `weaviate-grpc`). gitops-engine `getCorev1ServiceHealth` reports a
  // LoadBalancer Service whose `status.loadBalancer.ingress` is empty as
  // PROGRESSING, unconditionally and forever. kindnetd has no LoadBalancer
  // implementation, so on the default kind lane those two Services never
  // receive an address. kind `--cni cilium` applies a Cilium LB-IPAM alias;
  // that alias existing is not a measurement that these Services receive one.
  // `weaviate-0` was 1/1 Running for 39 minutes while the kindnetd case held,
  // which is exactly how the blocker stayed invisible behind the one that was found.
  //
  // THE HONEST ACCOUNTING OF THE ATTEMPT THAT FAILED: the `randAlphaNum` render
  // nondeterminism is real and stays proven by byte diff, and its
  // `ignoreDifferences` rule is KEPT (see the Application) because on metal,
  // where cilium-lb-ipam does assign LB addresses, it may well be the whole
  // story. What was wrong was the inference, not the measurement -- the
  // OutOfSync cause was established and the PROGRESSING cause was never
  // checked, so one confirmed cause was read as THE cause. The live run also
  // shows the resync loop survived the ignore rule, so "that rule closes the
  // loop" is UNMETERED -- implemented, plausible, unfalsified -- and this lane
  // cannot meter it until the health half lifts.
  //
  // LIFTS WHEN on kindnetd: never. kindnetd has no LoadBalancer implementation.
  // CLOSED ON kind `--cni cilium` by run 33697305243: both Services received
  // `status.loadBalancer.ingress` from zeta-lb-pool, Application OutOfSync/
  // Healthy, residual OutOfSync named as StatefulSet/weaviate rolling update
  // complete. `isExcludedFromIncludedProof` returns false for this dir when
  // `kindCni === "cilium"`. The metal Application `cilium-lb-ipam` stays
  // excluded. This set entry remains so kindnetd does not assert it.

/**
 * The two exclusion lists, linked (081M00QCNYM087G0R000ZS3CE2).
 *
 * There are TWO independent lists governing this lane and nothing used to keep
 * them in agreement:
 *
 *   1. WHAT ARGOCD APPLIES  - `DEFAULT_ROOT_DEV_CATALOG.excludeGlob` (ports.ts).
 *      Ground truth: a directory named there never reaches the CI cluster.
 *   2. WHAT THE HARNESS ASSERTS - `DEV_EXCLUDED_DIRS` +
 *      `DEV_INCLUDED_PROOF_DEFERRED_DIRS` + the derived, now
 *      SUBSTRATE-CONDITIONAL "requests `storageClass: longhorn` that this lane
 *      cannot serve" rule, via `isExcludedFromIncludedProof`.
 *
 * The difference between them is a SHADOW: Applications that are applied to
 * every CI cluster and asserted by nothing. Measured on 2026-08-16 it was 14
 * directories wide, and it contained most of the stateful core of the hardware
 * PoC (cockroachdb, vault, nats, redis, spire, ...). `cockroachdb` could not
 * even sync in that lane - it wants `storageClass: longhorn`, `longhorn` was
 * glob-excluded, so the StorageClass never existed and the Application hung
 * `Missing` forever while the harness reported `ok: true`.
 *
 * 2026-08-21 (081M0JXF6MS087G0R001HC34TM): ten of those entries are gone, not
 * because the reason was waived but because the reason stopped being true. The
 * dev clusters now apply a StorageClass NAMED `longhorn` backed by
 * `rancher.io/local-path` (`dev-cluster/manifests/longhorn.yaml`), so those
 * Applications bind and are asserted like any other. What survives here is what
 * the alias genuinely cannot fix.
 *
 * The shadow is not a bug on its own - deferring an Application is legitimate.
 * The bug is that the deferral was IMPLICIT, so it could grow silently. This
 * registry makes each one explicit and REASONED, and
 * `auditAppliedButUnasserted` goes red the moment the two lists drift apart in
 * either direction: a newly-applied Application nobody asserted, or a stale
 * entry here for a directory that no longer exists.
 *
 * Adding an entry is cheap and honest; adding one WITHOUT a reason is refused.

    "hindsight",
    "THREE independent blockers, established 2026-08-21 by rendering hindsight 0.3.0 against this Application's own valuesObject; any ONE of them defers it. " +
      "(1) CAPACITY -- AND HINDSIGHT IS THE SYMPTOM, NOT THE CAUSE. MEASURED run 32519516070: hindsight-postgresql-0 never scheduled -- FailedScheduling `0/1 nodes are available: 1 Insufficient cpu` -- so hindsight-api and hindsight-control-plane CrashLoopBackOff waiting on a database with nowhere to run. Its three requests are 500m (api) + 250m (control-plane) + 250m (postgresql), re-rendered 2026-08-22 from chart 0.3.0 against this Application's own valuesObject; every one is a CHART DEFAULT (`metalSource: chart-default` on all three rows), so no number here is a measurement of hindsight's working set and neither rung claims to be -- both are reservations. " +
      "THE ARITHMETIC THAT SAYS `SYMPTOM`, and it is why the deferral does not lift by shrinking this app: the dev lane APPLIES 38 Applications totalling 5231m at the rung the tree ships, against a 2500m budget (4000m runner less 1500m reserved). Hindsight is 1000m of that. Take hindsight to ZERO and the lane is still 4231m -- over by 1731m. Take hindsight alone to its `dev` rung (400m) and the lane is 4631m. Take the WHOLE lane to `dev` and it is 1081m, which FITS with 1419m of spare. THAT IS THE THIRD ANSWER THIS SENTENCE HAS CARRIED and the earlier two are kept rather than overwritten: 1906m fits, then 2906m over by 406m (gmod became visible), then 2006m fits (the rung learned to reach raw in-repo manifests), and now 1081m -- because 18 governed `cpuMillis.dev` rows were floored at 25m on 2026-08-23 (-1250m across all 47; -925m inside this lane), which is Aaron's observation that CPU is compressible taken at the rung where it is true. So the only cut that closes this is lane-wide -- and lane-wide is SUFFICIENT again, which is the second change of answer this sentence has carried and is written as a sequence rather than as a replacement: it closed at 1906m, then did NOT close at 2906m, and now closes at 2006m. mimir, at 1610m, is the larger single reservation. WHY IT MOVED TWICE: every number in that paragraph rose by 1000m on 2026-08-22 and nothing grew -- applicationDirs() enumerated depth 1, ArgoCD's include glob is not path-segment bounded (established against a LIVE cluster in app-of-apps-discovery.ts), and `game-hosting/gmod` -- an in-repo StatefulSet whose manifest carries a literal cpu 1 / memory 2Gi -- had been applied by this root since it was written and counted by nothing. This catalogue asserted in writing that it contributes 0m / 0Mi. It was then recorded here that `NO RUNG REACHES IT: it is a git-path source with no valuesObject, so `--resource-profile dev --apply` cannot touch it`. THE FIRST CLAUSE WAS TRUE AND THE SECOND WAS FALSE: `applyResourceProfile` writes a dotted path into an arbitrary manifest and always could reach statefulset.yaml; only the render-side reader demanded a valuesObject coordinate. Since 2026-08-23 three git-path Applications we own (1150m in total) are governed rows addressing their own manifests, gmod is 100m at `dev` and the unchanged 1000m at `metal`, and the lane closes. gmod did not schedule TODAY because its sync fails on gatekeeper's webhook -- a reprieve of the same shape as the one in the next paragraph, one resource type over -- and it was priced and governed rather than waited out. THE FOURTH ANSWER, 2026-09-03, and the three before it are kept: the lane is 39 Applications now, 6390m at the rung the tree ships and 1165m at `dev` (1335m of spare), because `agent-memory` LIFTED from the dev root's excludeGlob on its own recorded condition -- held by the glob, not by a measurement -- and brought 50m at `metal` / 25m at the `dev` floor with it. Between the third answer and this one the citations below moved 1081m -> 1056m -> 1115m -> 1140m without this sentence following (minio removed; mimir kafka + the nfd prune Job + alloy re-measured; cloudnativepg added), which is the drift the citations exist to catch and the prose did not. Nothing in this paragraph's argument changes: hindsight to ZERO still leaves 5390m, over by 2890m; lane-wide `dev` still closes it. " +
      "AND THE LANE HAS BEEN OVER-COMMITTED SINCE THE LONGHORN ALIAS LANDED, which storage-profiles.json predicted in writing: `the only reason that has not bitten is that 14 of them hang Missing on a longhorn StorageClass the dev catalog excludes, so they never schedule a pod. That is a reprieve, not a fit, and it evaporates the moment the StorageClass exists.` The dev lane now applies a `longhorn` StorageClass over rancher.io/local-path, so it has evaporated, and hindsight-postgresql-0 is the first pod to be handed the bill. " +
      "THE TWO SUBSTRATES ARE NOT CLOSE, which is why a fix for one is wrong for the other: the runner is 4000m (envelope, and `--measure-runner` convicts a smaller machine, so it is checked rather than trusted), while the checked-in ClusterNode registrations measure 16 cores (maintainers/Addisons820/cluster-nodes/node-ad1efd, node-b1e1b5) and 22 cores (maintainers/maximdolphin/cluster-nodes/node-5b2dfa, node-f82aa6). ~4x. The whole 47-app catalogue at `metal` is 9256m, which does not fit one runner and fits one 16-core box comfortably. THAT SECOND HALF IS CHECKED NOW, and it was not when this reason was first written: `compute-provenance` in single-node-readiness.ts compares the ACTIVE resource rung's total over the metal cohort against `spec.hardware.cores` and `spec.hardware.memory` on the smallest registered node, the same one-way way `capacity-provenance` compares the storage ladder against `spec.hardware.storage`. It REFUSES when no registration carries both. Green today -- 9256m against 16000m raw -- and the arithmetic is printed on every auditor run rather than only when it fails. Two units traps were found building it and are recorded at the parser: `cores` is `nproc`, i.e. LOGICAL CPUs (22 on a 16-core Ultra 9 185H), and `memory` is captured with `free -h --si`, i.e. DECIMAL, so `66G` is 62942Mi and not 67584Mi -- reading it as binary would have inflated the bound, which is the acquitting direction. " +
      "(2) THE `dev` RESOURCE RUNG CANNOT REACH THIS LANE, which is the part that looked like the fix and is not. `storage-profiles.ts --resource-profile dev --apply` rewrites the WORKING TREE; ArgoCD syncs the COMMITTED tree at `--git-ref`, and `bootstrap/root-application.yaml` points the METAL cluster at the same `main`/`full-ai-cluster/k8s/applications` path. One committed tree, two substrates, no override point -- so lowering these numbers lowers them for the 16-core box too, where the cost of an under-request is a pod evictable under node pressure rather than one refused a node. That trade is a maintainer call, not a CI convenience. " +
      'AND THE GREEN BUDGET GATE IS ABOUT A RUNG THE TREE DOES NOT CARRY, which is the part nothing had written down. MEASURED 2026-08-22, exit codes read directly: `--resource-profile metal --check` exits 0 (`manifests match resource profile "metal"`) and `--resource-profile dev --check` exits 1 with 54 drifts -- the committed tree IS `metal`. `--resource-profile metal --budget` exits 1; `--resource-profile dev --budget` exits 0. The `plan + unit tests` job runs the `dev` one. So the gate that is green is arithmetic about a configuration nobody applied, standing in front of a lane that then runs the configuration that exits 1. Nobody misreported it -- the workflow comment said `the same audit against the metal rung exits 1 today` -- but no check compared the two. `findRungCoverage` is that comparison now: the ledger declares `activeResourceProfile` (REQUIRED, refused if absent), `ciBudgetedProfile` reads the budgeted rung off the workflow\'s own run line rather than restating it, and a disagreement between them is a blocker unless the gap is carried as `acknowledgedRungBudgetGap` with all four numbers pinned. It IS carried today -- `metal@dev-lane=5231m/13475Mi>>2500m/9216Mi` -- so this remains a stated debt with a maintainer decision behind it rather than a hidden one, and moving any of those four numbers re-reddens it. ' +
      "EVERY CAPACITY NUMBER IN THIS REASON ROSE BY 1000m ON 2026-08-22 AND NOTHING GREW, which is the one part here that the two checks above do not already say: applicationDirs() enumerated depth 1, ArgoCD's include glob is not path-segment bounded (established against a LIVE cluster in app-of-apps-discovery.ts, in this repo, before this reason was written), and `game-hosting/gmod` -- an in-repo StatefulSet whose own manifest carries a literal cpu 1 / memory 2Gi -- had been applied by this root since it was written and counted by nothing. storage-profiles.json asserted in writing that it contributes 0m / 0Mi. The consequence for THIS reason was not cosmetic: it put the whole lane at `dev` at 2906m against a 2500m budget, STILL OVER by 406m, so taking the lane to `dev` was NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT. THAT HALF IS CLOSED AS OF 2026-08-23 AND THE CORRECTION IS RECORDED RATHER THAN OVERWRITTEN. This reason said `NO RUNG REACHES gmod, because it is a git-path source with no valuesObject, so `--resource-profile dev --apply` cannot touch it`. The premise was right and the conclusion was WRONG ABOUT THIS REPO'S OWN APPLIER: `applyResourceProfile` addresses `path` + `docIndex` + `requestsField` as a dotted path into an ARBITRARY manifest and could always have written into statefulset.yaml; only the render-side reader (`overlayRung`) required the `spec.source.helm.valuesObject.` prefix, and it is that reader -- not the applier -- that has been widened. Three git-path Applications we own, carrying 1150m of hardcoded requests no rung could reach (gmod 1000m, platform 100m, agent-memory 50m), are now governed resourceClaims addressing their own manifests. `cdi` (100m) and `kubevirt` (20m x 2 pods) are reachable by the same mechanism and were governed for one draft before being backed out: both manifests are vendored byte-for-byte from upstream, and single-node-budget.json says of kubevirt's that editing it `would make the checked-in copy diverge from the cluster it documents, which is a worse lie than this one`. REACHING A FILE IS NOT A LICENCE TO EDIT IT, so those 120m stay ACKNOWLEDGED rather than governed. The dev lane is 1081m and FITS with 1419m of spare, after the 2026-08-23 dev CPU floor; `metal` is unchanged at 5231m, because the rows reproduce the committed literals exactly and `--resource-profile metal --verify` is clean. gmod did not schedule TODAY because its sync fails on gatekeeper's webhook -- a reprieve of exactly the shape the longhorn paragraph above describes, one resource type over, and it was NOT treated as a fit: the 1000m was priced and then governed rather than waited out. " +
      "(3) THE valuesObject WAS PARTLY INERT against this chart, and that half is NOW FIXED TOO -- so this blocker is narrowed a SECOND time rather than left standing. Fixed 2026-08-22: the Application wrote `postgresql.primary.persistence.{storageClass,size}` (the bitnami subchart layout) where the chart reads `postgresql.persistence.*`; the `.primary` level is gone and the re-render is 10Gi on `longhorn` instead of the chart default 8Gi with NO storageClassName. RE-CHECKED 2026-09-02 AGAINST 0.9.2, and the previously-inert keys are GONE FROM THE MANIFEST: it now writes `api.env.HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER` and `api.service`, the spellings the chart actually reads, and the rendered api Deployment carries HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER -- so the old sentence here (`api.llm.{provider,existingSecret}` and a top-level `service` remain inert) described keys this Application no longer has and has been removed rather than re-stated. WHAT SURVIVES IS THE SUBSTANTIVE HALF, and it is unchanged: no HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_API_KEY env reaches the api container (it carries only HINDSIGHT_API_DATABASE_URL, HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MODEL and HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER). ALSO FIXED 2026-09-02, and NOT by the version bump: the chart defaults postgres to `ankane/pgvector:latest`, a repository Docker Hub reports as ARCHIVED with no push since 2023-10-11, and it still does so at 0.9.2 -- the Application now overrides it to the maintained `pgvector/pgvector`. AND THE HONEST LIMIT ON THIS THIRD BLOCKER, written because the exit condition below is the thing most likely to outlive its defect: nobody has measured whether hindsight-api can reach Healthy WITHOUT an LLM API key. It may start and fail only on first extraction, or it may crash at boot. Unknown, and left unknown rather than guessed -- so (3) is recorded as a DEFECT in its own right and is deliberately not claimed as a scheduling blocker. " +
      "TWO OF THE THREE BLOCKERS ARE SPENT AS OF 2026-09-05, measured, and this reason is narrowed rather than left standing at its original width. (1) CAPACITY IS CLOSED. This reason's own arithmetic says it: \"Take the WHOLE lane to `dev` and it is 1081m, which FITS\". CI now DOES take the whole lane to dev -- `--serve-tree dev` builds a copy of the tree with the rung applied and serves it from an in-cluster git server -- and the lane measures 1490m against a 2500m budget, 1010m of spare. The condition the paragraph named has been met by the substrate rather than by shrinking this app, exactly as it predicted. (2) THE RUNG-REACH BLOCKER IS CLOSED. It said \"One committed tree, two substrates, no override point\". There is an override point now, and it is the same `--serve-tree`: it rewrites a STAGED copy, never the committed tree, so the 16-core box keeps `metal` while CI gets `dev`. (3) IS THE ONLY ONE LEFT, and it is still genuinely UNKNOWN rather than quietly assumed: nobody has measured whether hindsight-api reaches Healthy WITHOUT an LLM API key. An attempt was made to read it from the last green proof run (33917879207) and FAILED -- job logs return empty and the check-run carries no annotations -- so the verdict is unread, not green. It is NOT lifted on the strength of (1) and (2) being closed, because a Healthy nobody observed is the vacuity class and this file exists to refuse it. WHAT WOULD LIFT IT is now one measurement rather than a capacity argument: one live run that reads hindsight's health line. " +
      "LIFTS WHEN: this lane reports hindsight at `health=Healthy` -- NOT `sync=Synced health=Healthy`. The lane accepts `sync=Unknown health=Healthy` (argocd, cert-manager, external-secrets, headlamp, loki and node-feature-discovery all pass that way in the same green run; minio was in that list until 2026-09-01 and is not an app any more), and a LIFTS WHEN stricter than the gate it names is exactly what kept `headscale` deferred for a cycle after its defect was gone. Reaching it needs (a) the lane-wide capacity trade in (1)/(2) settled by the maintainer, and (b) whatever (3) turns out to cost once (a) lets a pod run long enough to find out. " +
      "ANCHORS, CHECKED BY `reason-truth.ts`: each names an artifact this tree holds, so a claim that outlives its artifact goes red instead of reading on. The four capacity numbers above are citations rather than prose FOR THAT REASON -- they are the numbers a reader is most likely to act on, so they are the ones that must not be allowed to go quietly stale.

 * `dir` is applied by the dev root but NOT asserted by the included proof.

 * Three mechanisms, and the third one is now SUBSTRATE-CONDITIONAL
 * (081M0JXF6MS087G0R001HC34TM):
 *
 *   1. `DEV_EXCLUDED_DIRS`                  -- no dev substrate at all (GPU, CNI).
 *   2. `DEV_INCLUDED_PROOF_DEFERRED_DIRS`   -- a named non-storage blocker.
 *   3. claims `ReadWriteMany`               -- unservable by EVERY dev class.
 *   4. requests `storageClass: longhorn`    -- ONLY while dev has no class by
 *                                              that name.
 *
 * Rule 4 used to be unconditional, and it was circular: the apps were excluded
 * because Longhorn was excluded, and Longhorn was excluded because a kind node
 * has no second disk. `full-ai-cluster/dev-cluster/manifests/longhorn.yaml`
 * cuts the circle by giving dev a StorageClass that answers to the name, so the
 * question stops being "does this request longhorn" and becomes "can this lane
 * satisfy what it requests".
 *
 * RULE 3 IS NOT NESTED INSIDE RULE 4, and the ordering is deliberate. Every dev
 * class is `rancher.io/local-path`, so an RWX claim is unservable whether it
 * names `longhorn`, `zeta-local-path`, kind's default, or no class at all.
 * Checking the access mode only for longhorn-requesting apps would leave the
 * other three shapes able to hang.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A DELETION OF RULE 4, which would be the dangerous change: a
 * PVC that cannot bind stays `Pending`, and ArgoCD reports a pending PVC as
 * Progressing -- never Degraded. So the Application does not fail; it burns the
 * whole `--timeout-sec` (2400s in CI) and is then reported as
 * `ApplicationUnhealthy` naming the SYMPTOM (still Progressing) rather than the
 * cause (no such StorageClass) -- and if the 60-minute job cap trips first,
 * there is no verdict at all. The rule therefore still applies in full whenever
 * the substrate is absent (`aliasDeclared === false`).
 *
 * @param aliasDeclared substrate condition; defaults to reading the repo, and
 *   is threaded explicitly by `discoverExpectedApplications` so one filesystem
 *   read serves the whole roster and the unit tests can drive both branches.
 *   NOTE the default reads the REAL repo root, so a caller passing a fixture
 *   `appDir` must pass this explicitly or the two disagree about which tree

/**
 * A DEGRADED READ ON ONE POLL IS NOT A DEGRADED APPLICATION.
 *
 * The predicate above is correct about what `Synced/Degraded` MEANS and wrong
 * about how many samples it takes to know. Acting on a single poll converts a
 * rollout blip into a hard stop, and the run then reports a failure the cluster
 * had already recovered from -- the same shape as a check that did not run
 * looking like one that passed, pointed the other way.
 *
 * MEASURED, run 34369317553 (main, `de612352`). The wait aborted at T+123s of a
 * 2400s budget on `openziti-controller=Synced/Degraded`. The cluster events
 * captured seconds later, in the same job:
 *
 *   49s  Updated health status: Progressing -> Degraded
 *   32s  Updated health status: Degraded -> Progressing
 *
 * It had already left Degraded when the abort was printed. 2277 seconds of
 * budget went unspent on an Application that was recovering.
 *
 * AND THE SAME APPLICATION DID THIS BEFORE. The docstring above records run
 * 33830308187: the wait aborted on `openziti-controller=OutOfSync/Degraded`
 * while the pod was still `Init:0/1`, and "events after the abort went
 * Degraded -> Progressing -> Synced". The remedy then was to narrow the rule
 * from any Degraded to `Synced/Degraded`. That narrowing was right and was not
 * enough, because the defect was never WHICH sync status -- it was trusting one
 * sample.
 *
 * So the abort now needs the SAME Application degraded on TWO CONSECUTIVE polls.
 * The fail-fast property this exists for is kept: a genuinely dead workload is
 * still abandoned after roughly one poll interval (15s in CI) instead of 2400s.
 * What is removed is the single-sample false positive.
 *
 * Not a debounce over time, deliberately: consecutive POLLS, so the guarantee
 * does not silently change when `--poll-sec` moves.
 *
 * SUPERSEDED at the `waitForApplications` call site by
 * `evidenceBasedDegradedTerminalFailure` below (081KSXN940008QG0R000SCP2H1,
 * run 35628762464) -- kept, exported, and still under test rather than
 * deleted, because it is the regression pin for the false positive it fixed

 * simply `PodInitializing` -- still pulling images / provisioning a Longhorn
 * PVC. Two consecutive polls of an ordinary, still-in-progress first rollout
 * satisfy the old rule exactly as well as two polls of a genuinely dead
 * workload; the rule cannot tell them apart because it never looks past the

 * `progressDeadlineSeconds`) legitimately reports Degraded for MINUTES during
 * a first rollout -- this is documented Argo behaviour, not a bug in Argo.
 *
 * So: terminal-ness is now a question about the WORKLOAD, not about how many
 * times ArgoCD printed the word. An Application is terminally Degraded only
 * when
 *
 *   (a) a pod it owns shows HARD evidence waiting cannot fix --
 *       `podBlockingReason` below: CrashLoopBackOff at/above a restart
 *       threshold, ImagePullBackOff/ErrImagePull, CreateContainerConfigError,
 *       or FailedScheduling on insufficient resources -- fires on the FIRST
 *       poll that sees it, which is MORE fail-fast than the two-poll rule for
 *       a genuinely dead workload; or
 *
 *   (b) it has been continuously Synced/Degraded past a bounded ceiling
 *       (`DEGRADED_CEILING_SECONDS`) with NO pod making progress -- i.e. none
 *       of its pods are in an ordinary still-starting state
 *       (`podStillProvisioning`).
 *
 * A pod that is Pending/ContainerCreating/PodInitializing/`Init:N/M`, or

 * paths: it is evidence of an ordinary rollout, not of a stuck one, so the

 * applies directly, but a Pod is normally created by a Deployment/StatefulSet

 * with --soak-sec) named 8 (app, container) pairs, all restartCount 1-3. Run
 * 35695291413 -- the SAME tree, one push later -- named two DIFFERENT pairs
 * (argocd/repo-server, spire/spire-controller-manager) that had not restarted
 * the first time. A both-directions exact-match ratchet (the original design
 * here) treats a 1-2-restart dependency-ordering wait as equivalent in
 * severity to a genuine crash loop, and BOTH directions of "the set changed"
 * as a failure -- which cannot be right for a signal this run-to-run
 * nondeterministic: it would flake red on an unrelated PR most nights.
 *
 * So the policy is a THRESHOLD, per (app, container), not a set-equality
 * ratchet:
 *
 *   restartCount >= STARTUP_RESTART_HARD_FAIL_THRESHOLD (a real crash loop,
 *   not a single dependency-ordering retry) -- FAIL, unless the baseline
 *   names this (app, container) with a `maxRestarts` at or above the
 *   observed count (a KNOWN, bounded startup race, already investigated).
 *
 *   restartCount below the threshold and not covered by the baseline -- a
 *   WARNING (annotation + summary line), never a failure. This is the
 *   ordinary, expected shape of a first-rollout dependency wait.
 *
 *   A baseline entry NOT measured this run -- a NOTICE, never a failure.
 *   Absence is the expected case most runs (the dependency happened to come
 *   up in the right order this time). Its `lastSeen` date is what stops a
 *   baseline entry from silently documenting a container that no longer
 *   exists: unseen for more than STARTUP_RESTART_STALE_DAYS is flagged
 *   `stale`, a prompt to re-verify or retire the row, not a failure either.
