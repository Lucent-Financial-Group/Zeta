 *
 * 081KSXN940008QG0R000SCP2H1 - Kubernetes + ArgoCD health integration harness.
 *
 * This is the cluster-health lane carved away from the 081KSNY2Z0008QG0R0008PN7RQ USB/ISO
 * zflash harness. It proves a real local Kubernetes cluster can reconcile
 * the Zeta GitOps substrate to ArgoCD Application health, while zflash keeps
 * owning boot/reformat/key-retention semantics.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/argocd-health-test.ts --dry-run
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/argocd-health-test.ts --preflight
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/argocd-health-test.ts --run --provider kind --git-ref main
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/argocd-health-test.ts --run --provider k3d --git-ref main
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/argocd-health-test.ts --run --existing --cluster-name zeta-dev
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 - dry-run/preflight/run succeeded
 *   1 - health check failed after a cluster was reachable
 *   2 - usage error or named dependency/preflight failure

/**
 * The two exclusion lists, linked (081M00QCNYM087G0R000ZS3CE2).
 *
 * There are TWO independent lists governing this lane and nothing used to keep
 * them in agreement:
 *
 *   1. WHAT ARGOCD APPLIES  - `DEFAULT_ROOT_DEV_CATALOG.excludeGlob` (ports.ts).
 *      Ground truth: a directory named there never reaches the CI cluster.
 *   2. WHAT THE HARNESS ASSERTS - `DEV_EXCLUDED_DIRS` +
 *      `DEV_INCLUDED_PROOF_DEFERRED_DIRS` + the derived, now
 *      SUBSTRATE-CONDITIONAL "requests `storageClass: longhorn` that this lane
 *      cannot serve" rule, via `isExcludedFromIncludedProof`.
 *
 * The difference between them is a SHADOW: Applications that are applied to
 * every CI cluster and asserted by nothing. Measured on 2026-08-16 it was 14
 * directories wide, and it contained most of the stateful core of the hardware
 * PoC (cockroachdb, vault, nats, redis, spire, ...). `cockroachdb` could not
 * even sync in that lane - it wants `storageClass: longhorn`, `longhorn` was
 * glob-excluded, so the StorageClass never existed and the Application hung
 * `Missing` forever while the harness reported `ok: true`.
 *
 * 2026-08-21 (081M0JXF6MS087G0R001HC34TM): ten of those entries are gone, not
 * because the reason was waived but because the reason stopped being true. The
 * dev clusters now apply a StorageClass NAMED `longhorn` backed by
 * `rancher.io/local-path` (`dev-cluster/manifests/longhorn.yaml`), so those
 * Applications bind and are asserted like any other. What survives here is what
 * the alias genuinely cannot fix.
 *
 * The shadow is not a bug on its own - deferring an Application is legitimate.
 * The bug is that the deferral was IMPLICIT, so it could grow silently. This
 * registry makes each one explicit and REASONED, and
 * `auditAppliedButUnasserted` goes red the moment the two lists drift apart in
 * either direction: a newly-applied Application nobody asserted, or a stale
 * entry here for a directory that no longer exists.
 *
 * Adding an entry is cheap and honest; adding one WITHOUT a reason is refused.

 *
 *   1. `DEV_EXCLUDED_DIRS`                  -- no dev substrate at all (GPU, CNI).
 *   2. `DEV_INCLUDED_PROOF_DEFERRED_DIRS`   -- a named non-storage blocker.
 *   3. claims `ReadWriteMany`               -- unservable by EVERY dev class.
 *   4. requests `storageClass: longhorn`    -- ONLY while dev has no class by
 *                                              that name.
 *
 * Rule 4 used to be unconditional, and it was circular: the apps were excluded
 * because Longhorn was excluded, and Longhorn was excluded because a kind node
 * has no second disk. `full-ai-cluster/dev-cluster/manifests/longhorn.yaml`
 * cuts the circle by giving dev a StorageClass that answers to the name, so the
 * question stops being "does this request longhorn" and becomes "can this lane
 * satisfy what it requests".
 *
 * RULE 3 IS NOT NESTED INSIDE RULE 4, and the ordering is deliberate. Every dev
 * class is `rancher.io/local-path`, so an RWX claim is unservable whether it
 * names `longhorn`, `zeta-local-path`, kind's default, or no class at all.
 * Checking the access mode only for longhorn-requesting apps would leave the
 * other three shapes able to hang.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A DELETION OF RULE 4, which would be the dangerous change: a
 * PVC that cannot bind stays `Pending`, and ArgoCD reports a pending PVC as
 * Progressing -- never Degraded. So the Application does not fail; it burns the
 * whole `--timeout-sec` (2400s in CI) and is then reported as
 * `ApplicationUnhealthy` naming the SYMPTOM (still Progressing) rather than the
 * cause (no such StorageClass) -- and if the 60-minute job cap trips first,
 * there is no verdict at all. The rule therefore still applies in full whenever
 * the substrate is absent (`aliasDeclared === false`).
 *
 * @param aliasDeclared substrate condition; defaults to reading the repo, and
 *   is threaded explicitly by `discoverExpectedApplications` so one filesystem
 *   read serves the whole roster and the unit tests can drive both branches.
 *   NOTE the default reads the REAL repo root, so a caller passing a fixture
 *   `appDir` must pass this explicitly or the two disagree about which tree
 *   they are describing.

 * PROMISE dev a `longhorn` StorageClass". This answers "is it actually THERE",
 * and the gap between those two questions is the whole reason this function
 * exists. The repo can declare the alias while bring-up fails to apply it --
 * the manifest gets renamed, the apply call gets dropped in a refactor, the
 * kubectl apply silently no-ops against a context that is not the cluster under
 * test. In every one of those cases the harness would go on to ASSERT
 * Applications whose PVCs can never bind -- and an unbound PVC does not fail.
 * ArgoCD reports a pending PVC as Progressing, never Degraded, so the run burns
 * the full 2400s and then names the SYMPTOM ("still Progressing") rather than
 * the cause; and if the job's 60-minute cap trips first there is no verdict at
 * all. Three seconds and the right noun is strictly better than either.
 *
 * THE PROVISIONER IS COMPARED, not just the name. `kubectl get storageclass
 * longhorn` exits 0 for a class bound to `driver.longhorn.io` too -- which is
 * exactly the class a kind node cannot run. Checking only existence would let
 * both halves of the substrate condition pass while nothing can provision.
 *
 * Scoped to `included`/`full` because `smoke` asserts a floor of Applications
