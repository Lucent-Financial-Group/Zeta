/**
 * chart-assertion-census.ts -- per chart: is it asserted, and CAN THAT ASSERTION FAIL?
 *
 * -- THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS ----------------------------------------------
 * "How many charts are green" is the easy half and the misleading one. The half
 * that decides whether green means anything is: does something assert it, and is
 * that assertion capable of failing? A chart nobody asserts is untested however
 * green it looks. An assertion that cannot fail is WORSE, because it reads as
 * coverage.
 *
 * -- WHY THE SECOND HALF IS NOT OBVIOUS -------------------------------------
 * ArgoCD assesses health PER RESOURCE KIND, and it has no health check for most
 * kinds. A Namespace, a ConfigMap, a Secret, a ServiceAccount, an RBAC object, a
 * CRD, a Gatekeeper Constraint -- none of them contribute anything to an
 * Application's health verdict. So an Application whose ENTIRE committed
 * resource set is health-less reports `Healthy` with the same confidence whether
 * its resources were applied or not.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical here. MEASURED 2026-09-09 over the committed
 * manifests:
 *
 *   deepseek-coder   2 resources, 2 health-less  -- ASSERTED under the full contract
 *   qwen-coder       1 resource,  1 health-less  -- ASSERTED under the full contract
 *   cilium-lb-ipam   2 resources, 2 health-less  -- not applied on kind
 *   ddns             1 resource,  1 health-less  -- no Application at all
 *
 * `deepseek-coder` and `qwen-coder` are counted inside the lane's 37/37. They
 * were LIFTED into the asserted set on the reasoning that they "render exactly
 * one Namespace + one ConfigMap between them" -- which is the correct reason to
 * apply them and, unremarked, the exact reason their `Healthy` verdict carries no
 * information.
 *
 * STATED PRECISELY, because the overclaim is tempting: this does NOT say those
 * two are asserted by nothing. `Synced` is still a real signal, and
 * `failedSyncMessage` refuses an app carrying ArgoCD's own `SyncError` condition.
 * What it says is that the HEALTH half of `Synced+Healthy` is empty for them, so
 * the whole assertion rests on the sync half plus a condition check that landed
 * on 2026-09-09 and has one day of evidence behind it. Counting them beside
 * `cockroachdb` in one "37/37" hides that difference.
 *
 * The same blindness is what let `hat-system` pass with all seven Hat Constraints
 * unapplied (081M241X2YQ087G0R001K95PAB): 30 of its 32 committed resources are
 * health-less, so its Deployment being up said almost nothing about the rest.
 *
 * -- THE SECOND REFUSAL: A CHART THAT BELONGS TO NO JOB ---------------------
 * Nine directories are excluded from the dev root's glob, so no lane applies
 * them. Their reasons live in prose inside `ports.ts` -- readable, but not
 * machine-checkable, and saying nothing about whether ANOTHER job covers them.
 * `cilium` and `cilium-lb-ipam` are covered (the Cilium CNI leg and the k3d leg
 * bootstrap Cilium directly); the other seven are covered by nothing live and
 * that fact was not written down anywhere a check could read.
 *
 * So every never-applied directory must carry a registry entry naming its
 * covering job or stating that it has none. The registry is checked THREE ways,
 * because an excuse that outlives its defect is how a registry becomes a lie: a
 * new never-applied directory with no entry FAILS; an entry for a directory a lane
 * now applies fails as STALE; and an entry naming a directory the tree no longer
 * has fails as an ORPHAN. That third one was written and never falsified until
 * 2026-09-09 -- see the test file, which explains why the fix was to USE the
 * flagged import rather than delete it.
 *
 * -- ONE STATED LIMIT, so it is not mistaken for coverage ------------------
 * The census keys on Application DIRECTORIES, so a directory carrying manifests
 * and NO `Application.yaml` is invisible to it. There is exactly one today:
 * `full-ai-cluster/k8s/applications/ddns`, a lone CronJob. No lane applies it,
 * nothing asserts it, and this file does not report it -- which is recorded here
 * rather than quietly fixed, because widening the key would change what every
 * other row means.
 *
 * Run:   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/chart-assertion-census.ts [--markdown]
 * Exit:  0 -- every chart is accounted for
 *        1 -- an unregistered gap, a stale entry, or an empty census

 * Aaron 2026-09-09: "can we not look at the logs or have some post deploy tests
 * to tell what's working and what's not?"
 *
 * MEASURED the same day: `argocd-health-test.ts` carries 72 references to
 * `Synced`/`Healthy` and ZERO functional assertions. The lane workflow does
 * contain `nc -z` reachability probes and `git ls-remote` checks -- and every one
 * of them prints `OPEN`/`FAIL` and then `return 0`. They are DIAGNOSTICS, and
 * diagnostics are the right shape for what they do; none of them gates.
 *
 * So the whole lane asserts exactly one class of thing: `Synced + Healthy`, which
 * is ARGOCD'S OPINION ABOUT RECONCILIATION, not evidence that anything works. The
 * proof that the gap is real rather than theoretical arrived the same day: all
 * seven Hat Constraints were unapplied in runs that reported green
 * (081M241X2YQ087G0R001K95PAB). A gatekeeper holding zero policies is a
 * gatekeeper that reconciled perfectly.
 *
 * The map is kept as a map rather than a comment because the honest way to record
 * "nothing does this" is a registry a check can read, and because the first entry
 * should be a diff to this file rather than a new mechanism.
 *
 * REFUSAL: an entry must name a path that EXISTS. A functional assertion that
 * points at nothing is the vacuity class one level up -- a registry claiming
