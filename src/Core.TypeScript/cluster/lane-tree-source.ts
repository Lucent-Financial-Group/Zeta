 *
 * THE RESOURCE-RUNG OVERRIDE POINT: let the CI lane sync a tree that is not the
 * committed one, without changing the committed one and without pushing anything.
 *
 * -- THE PROBLEM, STATED BY THE HARNESS ITSELF ------------------------------
 * `argocd-health-test.ts` already names this, in the blocker note for hindsight:
 *
 *     "THE `dev` RESOURCE RUNG CANNOT REACH THIS LANE, which is the part that
 *      looked like the fix and is not. `storage-profiles.ts --resource-profile
 *      dev --apply` rewrites the WORKING TREE; ArgoCD syncs the COMMITTED tree at
 *      `--git-ref` ... One committed tree, two substrates, no override point."
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-09-03, `storage-profiles.ts --resource-profile <rung> --budget`:
 *
 *     budget: 2500m / 9216Mi   (runner 4000m / 15360Mi, less 1500m / 6144Mi reserved)
 *     dev    dev lane (39 apps):  1165m /  9164Mi   FITS
 *     metal  dev lane (39 apps):  6390m / 14352Mi   DOES NOT FIT
 *
 * The committed tree is `metal` (`single-node-budget.json` -> activeResourceProfile),
 * so CI applies 6390m of requests to one 4000m node. On run 33790413535 that showed
 * up as four pods the scheduler could never place -- `mimir-kafka-0` (metal 1000m
 * against dev 25m), `hindsight-api` (500m/25m), `hindsight-control-plane` and
 * `hindsight-postgresql` (250m/25m each) -- each reporting
 * `0/1 nodes are available: 1 Insufficient cpu`, which leaves `mimir` Degraded and
 * fails the included Synced+Healthy proof.
 *
 * IT IS NOT FIXABLE BY TRIMMING NUMBERS. The gap is 2.5x, and the metal rung is
 * correct for the substrate it names: 6390m on a 16-core box is unremarkable. The
 * two rungs are both right; what is missing is a way for one deployment to get one
 * of them.
 *
 * -- THE OVERRIDE POINT ALREADY EXISTS; NOTHING PUT A RUNG THROUGH IT ---------
 * `ports.ts` builds the root Application from `gitRepoUrl` + `gitRef` + `path`,
 * and `gitRepoUrl` is already an injected parameter (`ZETA_ARGOCD_GIT_REPO_URL`).
 * ArgoCD will clone whatever it is pointed at. So the override point is not a new
 * concept to invent -- it is a repository to point at.
 *
 * This module builds that repository: a copy of `full-ai-cluster/` with the chosen
 * rung applied, committed, and served read-only INSIDE the cluster.
 *
 * -- WHY IN-CLUSTER, AND NOT A PUSHED REF ------------------------------------
 * The obvious alternative is to push the rung-applied tree to a ref and point
 * `--git-ref` at it. Three costs, and the third is disqualifying:
 *
 *   1. It grows the repository on every run. The maintainer's standing concern is
 *      exactly this ("i just really want to protect our repo growth").
 *   2. It needs push credentials, so it cannot work for a fork PR.
 *   3. A SHARED ref races. Two runs in flight force-push the same branch and one
 *      lane silently syncs the other's tree -- a correctness fault, not churn. Per-run
 *      refs avoid the race and make (1) worse.
 *
 * Serving in-cluster has none of those: nothing leaves the runner, nothing is
 * pushed, and two concurrent runs cannot see each other because each cluster holds
 * its own copy.
 *
 * -- WHY DUMB HTTP, AND WHY NO GIT ON THE SERVER -----------------------------
 * The bare repository is built HERE, by the local `git`, including
 * `git update-server-info` -- which is the whole of what git's "dumb HTTP"
 * transport needs. The server is then a STATIC FILE SERVER over that directory,
 * so the serving pod needs no git binary, no smart-HTTP CGI and no credentials.
 * That is deliberate: every capability the server does not have is a thing that
 * cannot break in a lane whose failures cost forty minutes each. `git://` was
 * rejected for the same reason -- the daemon protocol is disabled by default in
 * some hardened git builds, and a transport that might be refused is a transport
 * this lane should not depend on.
 *
 * -- WHY THE TREE TRAVELS AS A ConfigMap -------------------------------------
 * MEASURED 2026-09-03: `full-ai-cluster/k8s` is 367 KiB gzipped, `applications/`
 * alone 214 KiB. That fits one ConfigMap with room to spare, so the tree can be
 * delivered by `kubectl apply` like anything else -- no host mount, no `kind`
 * config change (so k3d gets it for free), no image build, no registry.
 * `MAX_TREE_BYTES` below refuses rather than discovering the etcd limit in a
 * lane, and the refusal is a falsifier: it is what will fire the day the tree
 * outgrows this delivery mechanism, which is a real possibility and should arrive
 * as a message rather than as an unexplained apply failure.
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-09-04, live-k3d + live-kind-included 33821540802: packed=411676B
 * (under MAX_TREE_BYTES), then `kubectl apply -f -` died
 * `metadata.annotations: Too long: may not be more than 262144 bytes`. Client-side
 * apply writes the whole YAML into last-applied-configuration. Delivery therefore
 * uses `--server-side --force-conflicts` (see `applyLaneTreeSource`). The 700 KiB
 * packed budget is still the etcd-object ceiling, not the annotation one.
 *
 * -- WHAT THIS MODULE REFUSES ------------------------------------------------
 *   1. a staging copy with zero files                 -> the copy is broken; a
 *      served empty tree would make every Application vanish and read as a clean
 *      prune rather than as a fault
 *   2. a rung whose apply produces zero edits when the committed rung differs
 *      -> the override did nothing, and a lane that believes it is running `dev`
 *      while serving `metal` is the exact false-green this module exists to remove
 *   3. no self-referencing `repoURL` rewritten        -> the child Applications
 *      would still fetch OUR manifests from GitHub at the committed rung, so the
 *      override would cover the Applications and miss everything they point at
 *   4. a packed tree over `MAX_TREE_BYTES`            -> named, not discovered
