/**
 * cilium-k3d-values.test.ts — the k3d lane installs the SHIPPED Cilium surface.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.
 *
 * `bringUpK3dDevCluster` hardcoded a five-value `--set` list. One of those values
 * was `ipam.mode=kubernetes`, against a shipped surface that says `cluster-pool`
 * with an explicit `clusterPoolIPv4PodCIDRList`. Measured on the first live k3d
 * run (2026-08-31): pods landed on `10.42.0.x` — k3s's default cluster-CIDR —
 * and every pod on the overlay failed its probes while Cilium's own pods were
 * 1/1 Running. The passing kind lane on the same commit put pods on `10.143.x`.
 *
 * The defect was NOT that the lane was red. It was that the provider closest to
 * metal was installing the CNI configuration furthest from metal, so a green run
 * would have proven nothing about what hardware boots. Nothing could notice,
 * because no check compared the two.
 *
 * These are structural assertions on the value surface, deliberately not a
 * cluster test: they cost milliseconds and run in the ordinary suite.
