/**
 * secret-reference-audit.ts — which Secrets does the metal catalogue REFERENCE,
 * and which does anything actually PRODUCE?
 *
 * B8 in `docs/operations/FIRST-METAL-BRINGUP-FINDINGS.md`: Applications name
 * Secrets that nothing on metal creates. A referenced-but-absent Secret does not
 * fail loudly — the pod waits, ArgoCD reports `Progressing`, and the wave stalls.
 * That is the same shape as the `headscale`/`orleans` crash-loop: an Application
 * that never becomes Healthy and burns the whole health timeout reporting a
 * symptom.
 *
 * This module is the MEASUREMENT, not the fix. It exists so the gap is a number
 * that changes rather than a sentence in a register that ages — the register's
 * own count ("twelve ... against 22 references") was already stale when checked
 * on 2026-09-08, which is exactly the failure a roster has and a check does not.
