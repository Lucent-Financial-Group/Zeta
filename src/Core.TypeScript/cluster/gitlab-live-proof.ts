// GitLab LIVE proof -- the first lane that deploys GitLab on a real cluster and asserts that it WORKS.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// GitLab was repaired on paper four times (#17711, #17737, #17763, #17796: the retrying runner-token
// mint Job, `run_untagged`, requests, autoscaler caps, the LAN-address pin) and had never once been
// deployed by any CI lane. The WP11 installed-disk guest excludes `gitlab/**` (wp11-ci-envelope.json),
// the kind lanes exclude it (DEFAULT_ROOT_DEV_CATALOG), and the docs say it was "never asserted
// Healthy anywhere". Every one of those four fixes is a claim about a running system that nothing
// had run. This module is what runs it.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS -- each a separately named check that ends `passed`, `failed` or `did-not-run`:
//   (a) webservice / sidekiq / gitaly / registry / shell are each Ready;
//   (b) the root admin can log in (OAuth password flow against the live API, then `GET /user`);
//   (c) Job `gitlab-runner-token` completed AND Secret `gitlab-gitlab-runner-secret` holds a glrt- token
//       (the Job exits 0 on its own failure by design, so `Complete` alone proves nothing);
//   (d) the runner pod is Running, has NOT restarted, and `GET /runners/all` reports it `online`;
//   (e) an UNTAGGED `.gitlab-ci.yml` pipeline runs to `success` on that runner, in a Kubernetes executor
//       job pod;
//   (f) the Gateway is Programmed at the pinned address and the external URL + registry route answer
//       from OUTSIDE the pod network (the runner host, over the docker bridge).
//
// `did-not-run` IS A THIRD ANSWER, NEVER A PASS. A check whose prerequisite failed is reported as
// did-not-run with the prerequisite named, so a red (a) cannot be read as "(e) is fine".
//
// REUSE, NOT A PARALLEL FRAMEWORK. The cluster comes from `bootstrapKindClusterInProcess` (kind +
// the SHIPPED Cilium, ArgoCD, the dev StorageClass aliases, the dev-minted Secrets incl.
// `gitlab-initial-root-password` and `zeta-blob-store`, the served dev-rung tree). Only the roster is
// different: the root catalogue applies `seaweedfs` (GitLab's object store) and the `gitlab`
// Application is applied directly, because `gitlab/**` is in DEFAULT_ROOT_DEV_CATALOG.excludeGlob and
// that deferral is a statement about the SHARED lanes' memory budget, not about this lane.
//
// THE LAN ADDRESS IS PINNED THE WAY THE INSTALLER PINS IT. On metal `gitlab-lan-address` merge-patches
// three leaves of the Application's valuesObject to the LAST address of the resolved LB pool. This lane
// reads that SAME patch out of `k8s/lb-ipam/argocd-application.yaml.in` and applies it with the kind
// pool's last address, so the install-time patch shape is exercised against the real Application
// instead of being restated here.
//
