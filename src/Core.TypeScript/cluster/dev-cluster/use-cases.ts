/**
 * Mint the dev/CI credentials that Applications expect to find ALREADY PRESENT,

 *
 * THREE Secrets today, all listed in `DEV_BOOTSTRAP_SECRETS`, all for the same
 * structural reason: the Application deliberately does not let its chart invent
 * an admin password (so none is committed here), and nothing in the dev lane
 * ever supplied one.
 *
 *   `monitoring/grafana-admin-credentials` -- kube-prometheus-stack points
 *      Grafana at `grafana.admin.existingSecret`. Without it Grafana sat in
 *      `CreateContainerConfigError` (`secret "grafana-admin-credentials" not
 *      found`) while the rest of the Application -- prometheus and
 *      alertmanager, both on bound PVCs -- ran 2/2.
 *   `openziti/ziti-admin-credentials` -- ziti-controller reads `admin-user` /
 *      `admin-password` by `secretKeyRef` because the Application sets
 *      `useCustomAdminSecret: true`. Its chart's generated fallback is guarded
 *      off by that same value, and turning the fallback back on is NOT the
 *      cheaper fix: it renders a fresh random password on every `helm template`
 *      (ArgoCD's repo-server has no cluster for the chart's `lookup` to hit),
 *      which under `selfHeal: true` rotates the credential forever. See
 *      `DEV_ZITI_ADMIN_SECRET` for the measurement.
 *   `redis/redis-auth` -- Valkey `auth.usersExistingSecret`. Without it the
 *      included proof reported `redis is OutOfSync/Progressing` (run
 *      33657954802). Same Progressing-not-Degraded class as the two above.
 *
 * ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING for the same reason the StorageClass aliases are:
 * kubelet resolves `envFrom`/`env.valueFrom` at container-create time and a
 * missing Secret is a hard config error, so the Secret has to exist before the
 * Application that consumes it syncs.
 *
 * `ensureNamespace` IS NOT INCIDENTAL for `openziti`. trust-manager's trust
 * namespace is now that namespace, and its Role over Secrets is created there
 * at sync-wave -45 -- forty-five waves before `oz` would have created it with
 * `CreateNamespace=true`. So this call is also what keeps trust-manager's own
 * sync from failing in the dev lane. On metal the same job is done declaratively
 * by `k8s/bootstrap/openziti-namespace.yaml`.
 *
 * THE PASSWORDS ARE DRAWN FRESH PER CLUSTER, never committed and never printed.
 * A well-known constant would also have worked and would have been simpler; a
 * drawn one cannot be promoted to a real deployment by anybody copying it,
 * because there is nothing to copy. This is the ONLY place entropy enters --
 * `buildDevAdminSecretManifest` is pure and takes the value.
 *
 * AND IT IS IDEMPOTENT BY ASKING FIRST, PER SECRET. Re-running a bring-up
 * against a cluster that already exists is a supported path (both bring-ups say
 * so), and a bare apply would rotate an admin password every time.
 * `resourceExists` makes the second run a no-op for each Secret independently,
 * so a cluster holding one and missing the other converges rather than
 * re-rolling the one it already had.
 *
 * EXPORTED for the same reason `applyDevStorageClassAliases` is: `apply-root-app.ts`
 * is a third door into the root catalogue that neither bring-up guards.

 * MINTED or SKIPPED-AND-SAID-SO, never "minted something that will not work".

 * in the namespace that makes it look like the credential half is done.
 * `resolveRegistryToken` treats whitespace-only as absent for exactly that
 * reason, and this function skips rather than mints when it returns null.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THE SKIP SAFE RATHER THAN SILENT: `platform` is currently in
 * `DEFAULT_ROOT_DEV_CATALOG.excludeGlob`, so a cluster without this Secret
 * simply never syncs the Application that needs it. When that deferral lifts,
 * `assertDevRegistryPullSecretPresent` in `argocd-health-test.ts` refuses the
 * run in seconds and NAMES this Secret -- so the skip becomes a loud failure at
 * the moment, and only at the moment, it starts to matter.

/**
 * Point k3d's CoreDNS at a REACHABLE upstream resolver.
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-08-31, and this is the whole reason the k3d lane could not
 * reconcile an App-of-Apps. `argocd-repo-server` failed every fetch with:
 *
 *     fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/.../Zeta.git/':
 *     Could not resolve host: github.com
 *
 * so ArgoCD could never render, produced ZERO child Applications, and the
 * harness timed out waiting for one. The root Application sat `sync=Unknown`
 * (a ComparisonError) while reporting `health=Healthy`, which is why this took
 * three runs to see.
 *
 * THE MECHANISM, read off the cluster rather than guessed. k3s's shipped
 * Corefile ends with:
 *
 *     import /etc/coredns/custom/*.override
 *     forward . /etc/resolv.conf
 *
 * A k3d "node" is a Docker container, so that /etc/resolv.conf names Docker's
 * embedded resolver, `127.0.0.11`. CoreDNS runs as a POD on the cluster overlay,
 * where 127.0.0.11 is its OWN loopback and nothing is listening. Cluster names
 * still resolve (the `kubernetes` plugin answers them locally, which is exactly
 * why the cluster looks healthy); every external name fails.
 *
 * WHY KINDNETD DOES NOT HAVE THIS: kind's node image substitutes the host's
 * real resolvers into the node resolv.conf. kindnetd App-of-Apps clones
 * github.com without this override.
 *
 * KIND + CILIUM DOES HAVE THIS. MEASURED run 33695849211 (081M1DFQ2MZ):
 * same ComparisonError, same `Could not resolve host: github.com`, while
 * `zeta-lb-pool` assigned `cilium-ingress` 172.18.255.200. kubeadm CoreDNS
 * does not import `coredns-custom`, so the kind+Cilium path patches the
 * Corefile itself (`applyKindCiliumCoreDnsUpstreamOverride`). This k3d
 * function stays k3d-only. On metal /etc/resolv.conf names a routable
 * nameserver and neither override is necessary.
 *
 * The fix uses k3s's own documented extension point (`coredns-custom`, imported
 * by the shipped Corefile above) rather than rewriting the Corefile, so it
 * survives a k3s upgrade that regenerates it.
 *
 * SCOPE: k3d bring-up only. `bringUpKindCiCluster` kindnetd does not call this.
 * kind `--cni cilium` calls `applyKindCiliumCoreDnsUpstreamOverride` instead.
