// Bring up a kind cluster whose CNI is CILIUM, installed from the value
// surface the metal cluster ships, and assert what that actually proves.
//
// WHAT THIS LANE IS FOR
// ---------------------
// The other kind lanes take kind's default CNI (kindnetd) and kube-proxy, so
// the CNI the real cluster will run -- Cilium, kube-proxy-replacement, cluster
// -pool IPAM, WireGuard -- is exercised by nothing in CI. This lane runs it.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
// --------------------------------
// It does not install ArgoCD or the app-of-apps. That is the other lanes' job
// and folding it in here would make every Cilium failure arrive wrapped in
// forty unrelated Applications. This lane answers exactly one question -- does
// OUR Cilium configuration come up and serve as the CNI -- and it answers it in
// a log short enough to read.
//
// THE ASSERTIONS, AND WHY EACH ONE CAN FAIL
// -----------------------------------------
//   kindnet ABSENT       the profile's disableDefaultCNI took effect; without
//                        this, Cilium could be "installed" beside a working CNI
//                        and every other check would pass on kindnet's work.
//   kube-proxy ABSENT    `kubeProxyReplacement: true` is really carrying
//                        service routing rather than sitting behind kube-proxy.
//   nodes READY          the CNI is functioning: a node with no working CNI
//                        never leaves NotReady.
//   pod IPs from the    Cilium's cluster-pool IPAM allocated them. kind's
//   DECLARED pod CIDR    own default is 10.244/16, so this distinguishes
//                        "Cilium is installed" from "Cilium is the CNI". The
//                        pool is READ from the values actually installed
//                        (ipam.operator.clusterPoolIPv4PodCIDRList), never
//                        hardcoded -- the pod CIDR is derived from the cluster
//                        name (cluster-cidr.ts), so a hardcoded prefix here is
//                        a fourth surface that silently disagrees the moment
//                        the cluster identity changes.
//   cilium_wg0 EXISTS    the WireGuard kernel path worked. This is the one that
//                        was never exercised anywhere before this lane.
//   Gateway API verdict  compared against the gap recorded in
//                        cilium-kind-lane.ts, in BOTH directions.
//
// AND THE HONEST LIMIT, STATED IN THE OUTPUT TOO: with one node, WireGuard
// encrypts nothing. So does it on metal, for the same reasons -- see
// `encryptionReachability`. This lane proves the configuration INSTALLS AND
// SERVES; it does not and cannot prove that it encrypts.
