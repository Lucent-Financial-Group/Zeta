 * guards its generated Secret on `not .Values.useCustomAdminSecret` -- so with
 * the custom secret asked for, the render emits NO admin Secret at all
 * (MEASURED 2026-08-22: `helm template` of that chart against this
 * Application's own valuesObject yields exactly one Secret,
 * `ziti-controller-trust-domain`). The Deployment's init and main containers
 * both read `secretKeyRef` name `ziti-admin-credentials`, keys `admin-user` and
 * `admin-password`, which is why those exact strings are here and not guessed.
 *
 * WHY NOT JUST LET THE CHART GENERATE ONE. Because the generated Secret is
 * NON-DETERMINISTIC UNDER ARGOCD, which is strictly worse than the deferral it
 * would lift. `secrets.yaml` builds the password as
 * `(lookup ...).admin-password | default (randAlphaNum 32 | b64enc)`, and
 * ArgoCD's repo-server templates with no cluster access, so `lookup` returns
 * empty every time and the fallback draws fresh entropy. MEASURED the same day:
 * two `helm template` runs of the same chart, same values, with
 * `useCustomAdminSecret: false` differ in `admin-password`. With
 * `selfHeal: true` on this Application that is a credential rotating under a
 * running controller on every reconcile. So the manifest's stated intent is
 * KEPT and the dev lane supplies the source, exactly as it does for Grafana.
 *
 * THE NAMESPACE IS LOAD-BEARING BEYOND THIS SECRET. `openziti` must exist
 * before the app-of-apps root syncs for a second, independent reason:
 * trust-manager's Role over Secrets is created IN ITS TRUST NAMESPACE, which
 * this tree now points at `openziti` (see the trust-manager Application). A
 * Role applied into a namespace that does not exist is a sync failure at
 * wave -45, long before `oz` at wave 0 would have created it with
 * `CreateNamespace=true`. `ensureNamespace` in the mint is what makes the
 * ordering hold in the dev lane; `k8s/bootstrap/openziti-namespace.yaml` is
