// THE BAR THIS FILE HAS TO CLEAR, and it is not "the checker runs".
//
// A guard that cannot catch the instances that motivated it has not been shown
// to work. Two reasons in this repo were measured FALSE within a day of being
// written, and both audits over them stayed green:
//
//   temporal  #13472's reason cited a `helm-template-failed` acknowledgement
//             that #13469 had already deleted, forty minutes earlier.
//   oz        `ACKNOWLEDGED_UNPUBLISHED`'s entry reasoned about chart versions
//             against a pin that #13471 then corrected, and the "not drop-in"
//             claim inside it turned out to be false when someone rendered all
//             four versions.
//
// Both are reconstructed below AS THEY STOOD, and the checker is run against
// TODAY'S tree. It goes red on both.
//
// -- THE HONEST PART OF THE RECONSTRUCTION --------------------------------
// The historical reasons were free prose; they carried no `[cite: ...]`. So
// each reconstruction below appends the citations that TRANSCRIBE the claims
// the sentence already makes -- "carried as an acknowledged helm-template-failed
// row in its baseline" becomes `[cite: unrenderable full-ai-cluster/temporal
// helm-template-failed]`, and nothing else. The transcription is mine; the
// TRUTH VALUE is the tree's, and the tree is what refutes them. What this
// demonstrates is therefore precise, and it is worth saying rather than
// implying: a reason whose claims are written as citations is refutable by a
// program, and these two would have been refuted the moment they merged. It
// does not demonstrate that a program can read the prose they were written in.
// Nothing here can do that, which is why `uncited` is counted and printed.
