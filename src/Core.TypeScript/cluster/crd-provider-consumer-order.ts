 *
 * DOES EVERY CUSTOM RESOURCE HAVE ITS CRD BY THE TIME ARGOCD APPLIES IT?
 *
 * -- THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES --------------------------------------------------
 * `sync-wave-dependency-graph.yaml`'s own `platform -> kube-prometheus-stack`
 * entry already names the shape: `platform` (sync-wave -20) ships a
 * `monitoring.coreos.com/v1` ServiceMonitor + PrometheusRule whose CRDs are
 * installed by `kube-prometheus-stack` (sync-wave 0). Without
 * `SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true`, ArgoCD's dry-run rejects those two
 * objects on every cold boot ("no matches for kind ServiceMonitor") and
 * `platform` reports SyncFailed until wave 0 lands. That edge was found ONCE,
 * by hand, on 2026-09-03 ("derived mechanically ... by scanning in-repo
 * manifests for non-core apiVersions and mapping each custom kind to its
 * installing Application"), and nothing kept scanning after that one run.
 *
 * This module is that scan, committed and re-run on every PR that touches
 * `full-ai-cluster/k8s/**`. It answers three questions no existing checker
 * asks:
 *
 *   1. Which Application PROVIDES which CRD (group + kind)?
 *   2. Which Application CONSUMES which non-core kind, and at what wave?
 *   3. For every consumed kind, does its provider reconcile FIRST -- or does
 *      the consumer carry `SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true` (as an
 *      Application-level syncOption or a per-resource annotation) so a
 *      provider-not-yet-there is a deferred apply rather than a SyncFailed?
 *
 * -- WHY THIS STOPPED BEING BOOTSTRAP NOISE AND STARTED BEING A DEADLOCK RISK
 * Before `resource.customizations.health.argoproj.io_Application` existed in
 * argocd-cm (see `derive-sync-waves.ts`'s manual-sync-floor check and
 * `audit-argocd-pin-parity.ts`'s health-lua parity check, the sibling findings
 * this same effort produced), a SyncFailed resource inside an otherwise-Healthy
 * Application was cosmetic: sync-wave gating only ordered the APPLY of each
 * child Application, so kube-prometheus-stack's wave-0 apply proceeded
 * regardless of platform's wave -20 status, and platform's next auto-sync
 * (selfHeal) would pick up the CRD once it existed. Once Application health
 * assessment is restored, wave progression WAITS for each wave to be Healthy
 * -- so a permanently-SyncFailed resource can make its owning Application
 * permanently non-Healthy, which wedges every LATER wave, cluster-wide. An
 * ordering defect that used to resolve itself on the next reconcile can now
 * deadlock the bootstrap. That is what makes this analyzer load-bearing
 * rather than cosmetic, and why it ships in the same change as the health lua.
 *
 * -- WHAT COUNTS AS A "PROVIDER" ---------------------------------------------
 *   - A `CustomResourceDefinition` object rendered/read from an Application's
 *     own manifests (Helm chart render, or raw directory-source YAML).
 *   - A BOOTSTRAP-INSTALLED provider (`full-ai-cluster/k8s/bootstrap/*-install.yaml`,
 *     e.g. cilium, cert-manager, external-secrets, spire, trust-manager, plus
 *     the standalone `gateway-api-crds.yaml`) -- these are applied by K3S
 *     BEFORE ArgoCD exists at all, so they are ALWAYS available to every
 *     Application regardless of that Application's own self-managed wave.
 *   - An entry in `DECLARED_OPERATOR_CRDS` -- CRDs an operator registers at
 *     RUNTIME (when it reconciles its own top-level CR) rather than shipping
 *     as a static manifest. kubevirt and cdi are the two known instances:
 *     each vendored operator.yaml ships exactly ONE CustomResourceDefinition
 *     (its own controller CRD -- `KubeVirt`, `CDI`), and the workload CRDs
 *     (`VirtualMachine`, `DataVolume`, ...) appear only once the operator is
 *     running. Nothing in this tree consumes those kinds today (checked by
 *     the "no known consumer" test), so the table is precautionary.
 *
 * -- WHAT COUNTS AS A "CONSUMER" ---------------------------------------------
 * Any rendered/read object whose `apiVersion` has a group NOT in
 * `BUILTIN_API_GROUPS` (the groups vanilla Kubernetes always serves) and is
 * not itself a `CustomResourceDefinition`.
 *
 * -- RENDERING -----------------------------------------------------------
 * Directory-sourced Applications are read directly off disk (no render
 * needed: what ships IS what ArgoCD applies, modulo the `directory.exclude`
 * glob, honored here). Helm-sourced Applications are rendered with
 * `helm template`, the same invocation shape `full-ai-cluster/k8s/tests/
 * validate-applications.ts` already uses (OCI vs HTTP repo handling included)
 * -- reimplemented rather than imported because that file is a top-level
 * script with no exports, and duplicating ~30 lines of `helm template`
 * plumbing is cheaper than restructuring a script this repo's other tooling
 * already depends on running standalone.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 a real violation, 2 usage / render infrastructure
 * missing (helm not on PATH — never silently skipped: `--render=required`
 * (the default in CI) fails loudly rather than reporting a false clean).

// sync-wave progression by default any more. It does so ONLY for a child
// carrying `zeta.io/gates-later-waves: "true"` (081M33T23ZQ087G0R002ZYRHDG --
// architect review). Gating every Application uniformly (the upstream default)
// converts one never-Healthy app anywhere in the ~50-Application roster into a
// whole-cluster stall; gating NOTHING lets a genuine CRD consumer race its
// provider with no ordering guarantee stronger than the wave NUMBER. Opt-in
// providers is the middle: only apps a later wave actually depends on, and
// only when they are VERIFIED safe to wait on.
//
// This section is what makes "verified safe" a checked claim rather than a
// one-time review:
//   (a) NEEDLESS-GATE   -- a gating-annotated app provides nothing another
//       app consumes. Gating it waits on a promise nobody made.
//   (b) UNSAFE-GATE-*   -- a gating-annotated app depends on something that
//       can permanently prevent it from reaching Healthy on a fresh metal
//       install: an unminted Secret, a declared manual-sync posture (never
//       auto-synced, so real health is "Missing" forever), or a named
//       operator ceremony (CEREMONY_GATED_APPS).
//   (c) UNPROTECTED-NON-GATING-PROVIDER -- a consumer of a NON-gating
//       provider must be able to converge WITHOUT ever observing that
//       provider's health: either the consumed resource carries
//       SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true (platform's fix), or the consumer
//       itself retries automatically (`selfHeal: true`) so a transient
//       SyncFailed self-heals on the next reconcile.
//   (d) UNOBSERVED-GATE -- a gating-annotated app must be recorded in
//       GATING_EVIDENCE as observedHealthy: true. Static safety (a)+(b) is
//       necessary but NOT sufficient: both cilium and arc-controller passed
//       every static check in #17477 (zero secrets, not manual-sync, real
//       CRD providers) and were STILL wrong to gate on (#17497,
//       081M33T23ZQ087G0R002ZYRHDG follow-on) -- cilium's own Application
//       stayed Synced/Progressing for 15+ minutes on a real first-boot-replica
//       run (35696323545) with every cilium pod Running, and arc-controller
//       was never observed reaching Healthy on that path at all. No static
//       analysis of this repo's manifests can see either fact -- both are
//       runtime behavior of the rendered chart, observable only by actually
//       booting it. Hence: the bar for gating is OBSERVED Healthy on a real
//       first-boot-replica run, not "nothing in this repo's tree looks
