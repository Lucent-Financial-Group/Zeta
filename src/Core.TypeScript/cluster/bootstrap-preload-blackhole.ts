/**
 * src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/bootstrap-preload-blackhole.ts
 *
 * THE FALSIFIER FOR THE BOOTSTRAP IMAGE PRELOAD — boot the real
 * `services.k3s.manifests` roster with EVERY REGISTRY IN THE SET BLACKHOLED,
 * and find out whether the preload actually carried it. WP34
 * (081M3BZ111D087G0R000YBMKRY).
 *
 * -- WHY A BLACKHOLE, AND NOT A GREEN TEST -------------------------------
 * The claim is "first boot gets every bootstrap image with no registry
 * reachable". A test that preloads the images AND has a working network proves
 * nothing whatsoever: every pod comes up on an ordinary pull and the archive
 * could be empty, corrupt, or tagged under names containerd never looks up.
 * That is the check-that-cannot-fail class — `toy-is-free-metered-must-be-earned.md`
 * — and the only honest proof is a run where the pull WOULD have failed.
 *
 * So the registries are made unresolvable inside the container
 * (`--add-host <registry>:127.0.0.1`), and the hosts to blackhole are DERIVED
 * from the preload snapshot by `blackholeHostnames()` rather than typed here:
 * a test that blackholes a hand-written host list proves nothing about an
 * image that moved to a host nobody added to the list.
 *
 * -- THE NEGATIVE CONTROL IS NOT OPTIONAL ---------------------------------
 * `--both` runs the SAME boot twice — once with the archive, once with an
 * empty images directory — and refuses to report success unless:
 *
 *     positive run  =>  CARRIED    (every image resolved locally)
 *     negative run  =>  BLOCKED    (pulls were attempted and failed)
 *
 * If the negative run also passes, the blackhole is not working — the
 * container resolved the registries anyway, or the content came from
 * somewhere else — and THE POSITIVE RESULT IS DISCARDED rather than reported.
 * A blackhole test that passes on an empty images directory is the same defect
 * in a new costume, and half of it is not a result.
 *
 * -- THE OBSERVABLE, AND WHY IT IS A PROBE POD RATHER THAN THE CHARTS -----
 * Every image in the snapshot gets a Pod that names it VERBATIM and runs a
 * command that does not exist. The container therefore always fails to start,
 * and that is deliberate: what is under test is the IMAGE, not the workload,
 * and a probe that also has to run successfully would go red for reasons
 * (config, RBAC, a missing Secret) that say nothing about the preload.
 *
 * The verdict reads the kubelet's own words:
 *
 *   "already present on machine"   the preload carried it     -> CARRIED
 *   ErrImagePull / ImagePullBackOff  it had to pull, and could not -> BLOCKED
 *
 * That is the exact distinction the feature makes, and it is decided per
 * image rather than in aggregate, so a single reference the archive names
 * wrongly cannot hide behind twenty-four that it names correctly.
 *
 * The real roster is applied alongside and does boot, but the VERDICT READS
 * ONLY THE PROBE NAMESPACE, and that scoping is load-bearing rather than
 * tidiness. MEASURED 2026-09-25: reading events cluster-wide made a correct
 * positive run report BLOCKED, because the roster's own pods start SECONDS
 * into boot — before k3s has finished importing a 1 GB archive — and their
 * pre-import `ErrImagePull` events never expire. The probes are applied AFTER
 * the import completes, so they are the only pods observed under the condition
 * the claim is about. An experiment that also counts observations made before
 * the setup finished is not a controlled one.
 *
 * The verdict also does not wait for the roster to CONVERGE. That is
 * `first-boot-replica.ts`'s job and it takes an order of magnitude longer.
 *
 * -- WHAT IT PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT --------------------------------
 * PROVES: with every registry in the set unreachable, every image in the
 * preload set resolves out of the archive — i.e. the archive carries the right
 * blobs AND, the part no tarball inspection can establish, under the right
 * NAMES. That second half is not hypothetical: an archive built the obvious
 * way (`skopeo copy` into an OCI layout) fails it for the five digest-pinned
 * cilium references, measured 2026-09-25. See `archivePlan` in
 * `bootstrap-image-preload.ts`.
 *
 * DOES NOT PROVE: that the cluster reaches ArgoCD-landed, nor anything at all
 * about the ~109 catalog images, which still pull from eight registries.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/bootstrap-preload-blackhole.ts --plan
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/bootstrap-preload-blackhole.ts --both --archive <path>
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 = the pair of verdicts proves the claim; 1 = a pair that does
 * not (including a negative control that passed); 2 = usage/environment error.
