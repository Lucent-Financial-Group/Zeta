// Single-node readiness auditor for the hardware proof-of-concept.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// The investor PoC stands the whole stack up on ONE box. Kubernetes will
// happily let you do that, and it will happily let you LIE about it: a
// StatefulSet asking for `replicas: 3` under the CockroachDB chart's DEFAULT
// `podAntiAffinity.type: soft` schedules all three Raft members onto the one
// node you have. `kubectl get pods` then shows 3/3 Running and the demo says
// "distributed SQL" while the real failure domain is a single disk. Losing
// that disk loses the Raft majority; the database is unrecoverable.
//
// Empirically observed on a live single-node kind cluster (2026-08-14,
// podman/applehv, kind 0.31.0, kindest/node v1.35.0):
//
//   cockroachdb-0  Init:0/1  node=zeta-dejan-poc-control-plane
//   cockroachdb-1  Init:0/1  node=zeta-dejan-poc-control-plane
//   cockroachdb-2  Init:0/1  node=zeta-dejan-poc-control-plane
//
//   Longhorn volume datadir-cockroachdb-0:
//     state=detached robustness=faulted
//     Scheduled=False reason=ReplicaSchedulingFailure
//     message="insufficient storage;precheck new replica failed"
//   -> AttachVolume.Attach failed: "volume ... is not ready for workloads"
//
// ...because 1030 GiB of `longhorn`-class PVCs were requested against a node
// with 100 GB of disk. Both faults are STATIC properties of the manifests.
// This auditor reads them off the YAML so they are caught in CI, before a
// demo, rather than at minute 12 of a bring-up.
//
// WHAT IT CHECKS (each can go red; see single-node-readiness.test.ts)
//
//   A. root-app-collision   Two app-of-apps roots claiming the same
//                           namespace/name identity with different source
//                           paths. Kubernetes has ONE object at that
//                           identity; with prune+selfHeal the second apply
//                           deletes the first tree's entire child graph.
//   B. storage-budget       Sum of requested PVC capacity per StorageClass
//                           against the declared per-node disk budget.
//   C. false-redundancy     replicas > 1 without hard anti-affinity on a
//                           1-node cluster: nominal quorum, single failure
//                           domain. Must be acknowledged in the ledger.
//
// Verdicts are FACTS, not sentences (dual-use-detection rule): the tool
// reports "this StatefulSet's redundancy is nominal, not real on N nodes".
// Whether that is acceptable for a PoC is the ledger's (human's) call.

// `storage-budget` compares the declared PVC total against `nodeDiskGib` in
// the ledger. That number is 2048, and the ledger's own comment says of it:
//
//     "It is NOT a measurement of the box Aaron has today - it is the
//      requirement the manifests imply"
//     "STATUS: awaiting maintainer sign-off on nodeDiskGib"
//
// So on 2026-08-21 the auditor printed `no blockers.` and exited 0 while
// comparing ~1409 GiB of declared `longhorn` PVCs against an unsigned
// aspiration. A gate whose comparator is an aspiration is not a gate: it
// cannot fail for the reason it exists, and a check that cannot fail looks
// exactly like a check that passed.
//
// This check supplies a comparator that has PROVENANCE. Four ClusterNode
// registrations are checked in under `maintainers/*/cluster-nodes/*/node.yaml`,
// written by real metal boots: zeta-install.sh composes `spec.hardware.storage`
// from `lsblk -ndo NAME,SIZE,TYPE -e7` on the node itself. Those are measured
// bytes off real hardware, committed by a self-registration PR.
//
// THE INFERENCE IS ONE-WAY, ON PURPOSE
// ------------------------------------
// The bound below is the SUM of every whole block device on the node. That is
// deliberately over-generous: it counts the USB stick, and it ignores the ESP,
// the root filesystem, swap, and Longhorn's own reserve — none of which the
// registration records. So:
//
//   declared > bound  =>  PROVEN oversubscribed. No reading of the hardware
//                         rescues it; the disks are not there.
//   declared <= bound =>  proves NOTHING about whether it fits.
//
// It convicts, never acquits — the same shape as the rest of this file's
// verdicts, and the reason the finding says "exceeds every disk on the node"
// rather than "will not fit".
//
// Note this is independent of HOW Longhorn is told about those disks (the
// `node.longhorn.io/default-disks-config` mechanism, PR #12175): physical
// capacity bounds every disk-set mechanism from above, broken or fixed.

// bound it, and this repo leaves both at the chart's defaults in the tree that
// owns the storage ladder:
//
//   storageOverProvisioningPercentage   longhorn-1.7.2/values.yaml:214,
//                                       "The default value is 100"
//   storageMinimalAvailablePercentage   same file:216, "The default value is 25"
//
// So a disk stops accepting replicas well before it is full, and the honest
// figure to size a cluster against is ~75% of it, less the OS root. That is
// the number `--list` has always printed in its "needs ~N GiB of disk" column;
// what was missing is that the GATE never compared against it. It compares
// declared capacity against the raw sum, and passes anything under it.
//
// WHY THIS STAYS A REPORT AND THE RAW SUM STAYS THE GATE
// -----------------------------------------------------
// Not timidity — the raw sum is the only comparator with no assumption in it.
// The schedulable figure needs three things the registrations do not record:
//
//   1. WHICH devices Longhorn manages. `defaultDataPath: /var/lib/longhorn`
//      puts the default disk on the ROOT filesystem, so on node-ad1efd only
//      /dev/nvme0n1 is a Longhorn disk unless /dev/sda is mounted and added by
//      hand. Counting both is an assumption in the generous direction.
//   2. How big the OS root is. 30 GiB is a BUDGET CHOICE here, not a measurement.
//   3. `storageReservedPercentageForDefaultDisk`, a THIRD reserve which the
//      chart leaves at `~` and whose default the chart does not state
//      (values.yaml:218 documents the field, not the number). Real schedulable
//      capacity is therefore at most what this computes, never more.
//
// A bound built on three assumptions can be wrong in the acquitting direction,
// and this file's whole discipline is that its inferences convict and never
// acquit. So: the raw sum keeps the exit code, the schedulable estimate is
// printed beside it, and a profile whose BRING-UP total clears the schedulable
// estimate is one somebody has actually checked rather than hoped about.

// COMPUTE provenance — the CPU/memory half of the same comparator
//
// WHY IT EXISTS, AND WHAT WAS MISSING
// -----------------------------------
// `findCapacityProvenance` above compares the DECLARED storage ladder against
// MEASURED hardware read off the checked-in ClusterNode registrations. Nothing
// did that for CPU or memory. The CPU/memory ladder had two rungs, one of them
// was written into the manifests, and the only machine either rung was ever
// compared against was a 4000m GitHub runner — while the registrations record
// 16 and 22 logical CPUs. Roughly 4x between the substrate the numbers were
// validated against and the substrate they are for.
//
// So the `metal` rung's figures were declarations validated by nothing. This is
// the missing comparator, built on the same three commitments as the storage
// one:
//
//   1. REFUSE without a comparator. No registration carrying a measurable
//      `spec.hardware.cores` / `spec.hardware.memory` means there is no
//      comparator with provenance, and the honest verdict is "I cannot know".
//      Not acknowledgeable — an absent comparator is an absent check.
//   2. CONVICT, NEVER ACQUIT. The bound is the node's whole measured capacity
//      with nothing held back for the kubelet, the control plane, kube-system,
//      or the OS. Exceeding it is proven oversubscription; not exceeding it
//      proves nothing on its own, and the message says so.
//   3. FLOOR PER DIMENSION. The smallest-CPU node and the smallest-RAM node are
//      not necessarily the same box (`verifiedNodeCompute`).
//
// AND IT IS COMPUTED OVER THE METAL COHORT, NOT THE DEV LANE. The bootstrap
// root applies every Application in the tree; the CI root excludes nine. Pricing
// the metal box against the dev lane's 37 would under-count by every app the
// dev lane happens to skip — which includes gitlab, ollama, vllm and longhorn,

 * whose Application says nothing at all about storage (gitlab 76, loki 20,
 * mimir-alertmanager 1, dapr 1). No amount of teaching this extractor to read
 * blank classes recovers those: there is no key in our tree to read.
 *
 * So the two figures are NOT redundant and neither supersedes the other on
 * every question. The derived one answers "how much did we DECLARE", which is
 * what the storage-profile ladder governs; the rendered one answers "how much
 * will the cluster ASK FOR", which is what the disk has to hold. The second is
 * the one to trust for capacity, and the report says so in those words rather
 * than printing two numbers and leaving the reader to choose.
 *
 * PER TREE, because the two Application roots are mutually exclusive: the
 * ledger's own `acknowledgedRootAppDuplicates` records that both declare
