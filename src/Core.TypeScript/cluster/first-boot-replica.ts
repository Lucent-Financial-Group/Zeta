 * src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/first-boot-replica.ts
 *
 * FIRST-BOOT REPLICA — boot the REAL k3s manifest roster the USB installer's
 * control-plane node applies, in a Docker container configured to match
 * `full-ai-cluster/nixos/modules/k3s-server.nix` (+ `local-storage.nix`) as
 * closely as a container can, and report NAMED verdicts on whether the
 * roster converges.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Nothing in CI boots this roster today:
 *   - `argocd-health-test.ts` (the Docker/k3d and Docker/kind lanes) installs
 *     ArgoCD through `dev-cluster/use-cases.ts`, a DIFFERENT bring-up path —
 *     it never runs `services.k3s.manifests` at all.
 *   - `full-ai-cluster/nixos/tests/k3s-first-boot-roster.nix` runs the real
 *     roster inside a NixOS VM test, but nothing in `.github/workflows/`
 *     builds it (it needs a KVM host + ~45-70 min + ~10GB of pulls).
 *   - `full-ai-cluster/nixos/tests/k3s-first-boot-apply-order-eval-test.nix`
 *     checks the roster's apply ORDER at the Nix-value level, with no VM.
 *
 * This harness sits between the two Nix tests: cheaper than the VM test (a
 * container, not a QEMU VM — no KVM host required), and unlike the eval test
 * it actually BOOTS k3s and answers the open question in k3s-server.nix
 * comment block #5 — does the k3s deploy controller retry the unknown-kind
 * apply of `root-application.yaml`? — empirically, with a named verdict.
 *
 * DERIVATION, NOT A SECOND COPY. Every flag, every roster entry, and the k3s
 * version come from PARSING the real Nix/JSON sources at run time:
 *   - `nixos/modules/k3s-server.nix`   -> extraFlags[] + 10 manifest entries
 *   - `nixos/modules/local-storage.nix` -> the 11th (inline `pkgs.writeText`)
 *   - `k8s/kubernetes-version.json`     -> the k3s version (already the ONE
 *     declared version per that file's own header; no second pin is added)
 *   - `cluster-identity.json` + `cluster-cidr.ts` -> --cluster-cidr /
 *     --service-cidr (same derivation the Nix twin `cluster-network.nix` and
 *     the golden vectors hold to)
 * A parser that cannot see a shape fails LOUDLY (never silently skips) —
 * `.claude/rules/never-assume-malice-where-mistake-is-possible.md` aside,
 * a parser that goes quiet on an unrecognised line is the vacuity class:
 * it looks like coverage and provides none.
 *
 * TWO RESOURCE MODES, ANSWERING TWO DIFFERENT QUESTIONS (WP33). They are not
 * a better and a worse version of each other; keep both.
 *
 *   `mode=unconstrained` (the default, and the ONLY behaviour before WP33) —
 *     no `--cpus`, no `--memory`. The container gets the whole runner. This
 *     answers "IS THE ROSTER INTERNALLY CONSISTENT?": do the manifests apply,
 *     do the waves order, do the charts render, does the root Application land.
 *     Every baseline recorded in this file was measured in this mode and none
 *     of them moves — `--constrained` is purely additive.
 *
 *   `mode=constrained` (`--constrained`) — applies the INSTALLED-DISK guest's
 *     own envelope, imported from `ci/qemu-full-install-test.ts`
 *     (`K3S_VERIFY_CPU_COUNT` / `K3S_VERIFY_MEMORY_MB`), never a second copy of
 *     those numbers. This answers "DOES IT CONVERGE WHEN THE CONTROL PLANE HAS
 *     TO COMPETE?" — the question the installed-disk lane costs a ~90-minute
 *     ISO build to ask, and this lane asks in minutes.
 *
 * WHAT THE CONSTRAINED MODE ACTUALLY BINDS, and why that is its PURPOSE rather
 * than its limitation. Both lanes run on `ubuntu-24.04` (4 vCPU / ~15.9 GiB), so
 * `--cpus=4` there is at or above what the host would give anyway and DOES NOT
 * BIND. The CPU tax the installed-disk lane really pays is QEMU's own overhead,
 * which is not expressible as a `--cpus` number, and inventing a tax fraction
 * ("QEMU costs about 40%, so --cpus=2.5") would be a fabricated constant wearing
 * a measurement's clothes. So this mode binds MEMORY, DENIES SWAP, and leaves
 * CPU effectively unbound -- and says so.
 *
 * That is exactly the instrument WP32's standing prediction needs. After the
 * control-plane capacity fix (#17666) the claim on record is that the failure
 * mode should MOVE TO MEMORY rather than vanish: the roster over-commits the
 * guest's memory (1.47x at the dev rung), and that never bit only because CPU
 * starvation stopped 14 of 49 Applications from ever being created. A lane that
 * constrains memory while leaving CPU alone tests that claim IN ISOLATION.
 *
 * THE SWAP DENIAL IS THE SHARPER HALF, and it is derived, not chosen. Docker's
 * default `--memory-swap` is 2x `--memory`, so a plain `--memory=12288m` would
 * have handed the container 12 GiB of the RUNNER'S SWAPFILE that the real node
 * does not have -- `hosts/control-plane/hardware-configuration.nix` declares
 * `swapDevices = [ ]`. Memory pressure would then have surfaced as thrash
 * instead of the OOM kill the guest actually takes, and the lane would have
 * looked like it survived a condition it had quietly been excused from: a
 * fidelity defect that is invisible by construction and would have been
 * permanent. It is derived from that host config rather than set to a literal
 * so that it stays true if someone gives the node swap later.
 *
 * FIRST MEASURED RESULT (dispatch 36119931377, both jobs in parallel on 5855983,
 * a commit carrying both #17654 and #17666). THE LANE CAN FAIL, AND IT DOES:
 *
 *              unconstrained                    constrained
 *   stage 6    35 Healthy / 5 DIV / 2 FAIL      22 Healthy / 3 DIV / 17 FAIL
 *   soak       0 unexpected restart regressions 11 unexpected
 *   stage 8    PASS  RECOVERED                  FAIL  NOT_RECOVERED (spire-server)
 *   wall       65m51s                           59m44s
 *
 * Memory was the ONLY limit that bound (`cpu-limit-binds=no memory-limit-binds=yes`
 * on both lines, host 4 vCPU / 15989m), and constraining it cost 13 Healthy
 * Applications and produced 15 more FAILs. Note the constrained run was FASTER
 * while converging far worse -- stage 6 gives up and moves on, so wall clock is
 * not a convergence proxy.
 *
 * THE MECHANISM IT REPRODUCES IS A LIVENESS CRASH-LOOP CASCADE:
 *
 *   memory pressure -> containers slow -> LIVENESS PROBES TIME OUT ->
 *   the kubelet SIGKILLs them -> restart -> more pressure
 *
 * and the kill's origin is MEASURED, not inferred: the cluster emitted 61 kubelet
 * `Normal Killing ... Container <name> failed liveness probe, will be restarted`
 * events, over 28 DISTINCT containers -- including `coredns` and `metrics-server`,
 * which are not workloads but the node's own floor. That is why exit 137 arrives
 * with `Reason: Error` and there are ZERO `OOMKilled`, ZERO `Evicted` and no
 * `MemoryPressure` node condition: the LIVENESS PROBES KILL THESE CONTAINERS
 * BEFORE THE OOM KILLER EVER REACHES THEM. `OOMKilled` is what a pod's own memory
 * cgroup produces; a kubelet probe kill produces `Error`.
 *
 * The probe failures are `context deadline exceeded` rather than `connection
 * refused` almost throughout -- the endpoint is there and cannot answer in time,
 * which is starvation, not a crash. Named components include argocd-repo-server,
 * argocd-server, cert-manager-webhook, cilium-operator, hubble-relay/ui,
 * dapr-{operator,sentry,placement-server,scheduler-server}, keda's manager,
 * argo-workflows, spire-{server,agent,controller-manager}, coredns,
 * metrics-server, kube-state-metrics, prometheus, grafana, tempo, loki's canary,
 * sealed-secrets' controller, headlamp, and cockroachdb (which also logged `slow
 * range RPC: have been waiting 118.13s`).
 *
 * SO WP32'S PREDICTION IS CONSISTENT WITH THIS AND IS NOT CONFIRMED IN THE FORM
 * IT WAS STATED. The failure did move, and it moved when memory was the only
 * thing constrained -- but it arrives as a liveness cascade rather than as the OOM
 * kill or eviction that "the failure mode moves to memory" predicted. Memory
 * pressure is the plausible upstream cause and this harness has not measured that
 * it is the ONLY one; what it has measured is the kill mechanism.
 *
 * THIS REPO ALREADY OWNS THE LEVER: `liveness-kill-budget.ts` computes
 * `initialDelaySeconds + (failureThreshold - 1) * periodSeconds`, and keda's
 * Application carries the worked precedent (threshold widened 3 -> 20 after
 * keda-operator was measured restarting in 4 of 5 CI runs, because that chart
 * ships no `startupProbe`). The 28 containers above are a LIST, not an anecdote,
 * and unlike the run that motivated keda's fix this one is controlled. Deliberately
 * NOT acted on in the change that produced it: a budget widened in the same commit
 * would make the measurement unreviewable.
 *
 * COMPARING TWO RUNS: use two runs OF THE SAME COMMIT. On schedule and dispatch
 * both jobs run in parallel on one commit for exactly this reason. A constrained
 * run compared against a remembered unconstrained number from an earlier commit
 * confounds the envelope with whatever landed in between, and the difference
 * reads as "constraint" when part of it is "the fixes".
 *
 * AND THE MODE IS REPORTED ON EVERY RUN, in stdout, in the JSON report and in
 * the step-summary markdown — with the HOST capacity beside it, so a reader can
 * tell whether each declared limit actually BINDS. A `--cpus=4` on a 4-vCPU
 * runner constrains nothing; reporting it as a constraint would be a check that
 * cannot fail wearing a measurement's clothes. See `describeResourceMode`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/first-boot-replica.ts --dry-run

 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/first-boot-replica.ts --run --constrained
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/first-boot-replica.ts --run --keep --json-out report.json
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 = every required stage verdict passed; 1 = a required stage
 * failed; 2 = usage/environment error (docker missing, parse failure).

/**
 * A MEASURED FIDELITY GAP, recorded here because it changes how this harness's
 * results should be read (WP32, 2026-09-25).
 *
 * This argv sets no `--cpus`, no `--memory` and no `--cpuset-cpus`. The container gets
 * the whole runner host and no hypervisor tax. The installed-disk lane it stands in for
 * does not: `qemu-full-install-test.ts` gives the WP11 guest `-m 12288 -smp 4`, inside a
 * 4-vCPU/16-GiB runner that is also running QEMU itself.
 *
 * So the replica is SYSTEMATICALLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT CPU, and that is exactly the axis
 * that matters for the ArgoCD control plane. Dispatch 36097310492 measured the gap: the
 * installed disk peaked at 25/35 Synced+Healthy and fell to 13/35, while this harness's
 * most recent full run reached 35 Healthy of 42. Eviction is REFUTED as the cause of that
 * difference -- the serial carries zero evictions and zero OOM kills -- which leaves CPU
 * headroom as the remaining explanation, and CPU headroom is precisely what this argv
 * declines to constrain.
 *
 * WHAT THAT MEANS FOR A READER: a green run here is evidence that the roster is
 * INTERNALLY CONSISTENT -- manifests apply, waves order, charts render -- and is NOT
 * evidence that it converges on constrained hardware. This harness cannot currently
 * produce the repo-server starvation the installed-disk lane reproduces on every run.
 *
 * NOT FIXED HERE, deliberately. Adding `--cpus=4 --memory=12g` would narrow the gap and
 * is the obvious next step, but it changes what every existing baseline in this file
 * measured, so it is a change to make on purpose with the baselines re-measured rather
 * than as a side effect of the change that noticed it.
 *
 * WP33 (2026-09-25) TOOK THAT NEXT STEP AS A SECOND MODE, NOT AS AN EDIT TO THIS ONE.
 * `opts.limits` is absent by default and this argv is unchanged when it is, so every
 * baseline above still describes what the default lane measures. `--constrained` supplies
 * the installed-disk guest's own envelope (imported, never re-typed) and answers the other
 * question. The paragraph above stands as the correct reading OF THE DEFAULT MODE.
 *
 * ONE MEASURED CAVEAT WP33 ADDS, because it changes how a constrained green reads: both
 * lanes run on `ubuntu-24.04` (4 vCPU / 16 GiB), so `--cpus=4` there is at or above what
 * the host would give anyway and DOES NOT BIND. The memory limit does (12288m of ~15.9 GiB),
 * and so does the swap denial. That is why `describeResourceMode` prints a per-limit
 * `*-binds` verdict instead of only the numbers — see its docstring.

 * namespace's events. A FAIL app with NO attributed pod issue (Argo's own

 * weaviate's StatefulSet health check) instead dumps the Application's own
