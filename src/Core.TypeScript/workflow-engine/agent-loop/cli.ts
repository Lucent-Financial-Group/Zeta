/**
 * agent-loop/cli.ts — the execute → menu → choose → append shell.
 *
 * ── THE LOOP THE README DESCRIBES, ACTUALLY RUNNING ──────────────────────────
 * *"Every invocation reads current state from Git, gets a menu (the 'choose-your-own-adventure
 * output'), returns a choice. Script executes choice + appends new state."* That sentence has been
 * in the README since the module was written, listed under v2 scope, unimplemented. This is it.
 *
 *   bun cli.ts --agent alexa --at 2026-09-03T10:00:00.000Z --root .agent-loop
 *   bun cli.ts --agent alexa --at ... --choose 0          # take the first option
 *   bun cli.ts --agent alexa --at ... --choose EnterFreeTime
 *   bun cli.ts --agent alexa --at ... --history
 *
 * ── WHY `--at` IS REQUIRED AND NOT DEFAULTED ─────────────────────────────────
 * `.claude/rules/local-time-never-enters-the-shared-fold.md`. The record's time decides its ZetaId,
 * which decides its path, so a clock read here would put the same logical cycle at different
 * addresses on different machines and make the store non-replayable. Time enters through the
 * command line — a declared channel — or the run refuses.
 *
 * ── THE CHOICE IS CLAMPED, NEVER TRUSTED ─────────────────────────────────────
 * `--choose` names an index or a tag. An index outside the menu is CLAMPED into it and the clamp is
 * reported; a tag that is not on the menu is refused rather than silently substituted. The menu is
 * the legal set and nothing gets to leave it — the same kernel the rest of this substrate uses.
 *
 * ── EXIT CODES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   0  a cycle ran (or the history was printed)
 *   1  the run was refused — no `--at`, an unknown agent, a tag not on the menu
 *   2  the menu was COERCIVE. Loud and separate, because a menu with no way out is a different
 *      kind of wrong from a bad argument, and collapsing them would hide it behind user error.
