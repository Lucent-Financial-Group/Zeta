# `src/Core.TypeScript/workflow-engine/agent-loop/` — 081KSKBP80008QG0R000B3Y19A.5 substrate: agent-loop state machine

## Operator framing 2026-05-28

> _"so how can i code this into f# DU implicit state machine with small functions or Typescript and the agent loop basiclaly becomes execute script look at choose your own adventure output, take action based on outpout"_

## Design discipline

Clean separation per operator framing:

- **Deterministic script** (TS modules in this directory + future F# DU types in `src/Core.FSharp/WorkflowEngine/`) holds STATE MACHINE
- **LLM (any agent)** is pure MENU-SELECTOR (reads menu, returns choice)
- **State persists in Git append-only** (per 081KSKBP80008QG0R000B3Y19A + 081KSKBP80008QG0R001KK9WV6)

The agent (LLM) never holds state internally. Every invocation reads current state from Git, gets a menu (the "choose-your-own-adventure output"), returns a choice. Script executes choice + appends new state.

## State machine (DU)

10 states forming a cycle around `Idle` (the cycle boundary):

```text
                                Idle
                                 │

Idle ──(EscapeHatch | ProposeNewGrammarAction | RequestOperatorAttention)
       ──→ OperatorAttentionRequested  (stays; waits for operator)
```

## Menu-generator-as-conversational-UX-design discipline

Per operator 2026-05-28: **"Menu quality is everything. this is the use conversational UX design."**

The menu-generator function `(status_surface, current_state) → MenuOption[]` is a conversational-UX-design discipline, not just a software-architecture discipline. Menu quality determines whether the workflow serves participants or wastes them:

- A menu omitting valid options is COERCIVE (cage-shape per Otto Mod 1)
- A menu including irrelevant options is NOISE (cognitive load)
- A menu offering options aligned with current state + agent-interest + operator-priorities is SUBSTRATE

The menu-generator is where alignment lives. Composes with `.claude/agents/user-experience-engineer.md` (the user-experience-researcher role) at the conversational-UX scope; menu-generator engineering benefits from UX-research discipline.

## Jira-replacement substrate

Per operator 2026-05-28: **"now i don't need jira hell yes!!!!"**

The workflow engine + state-machine-in-Git + menu-driven loop REPLACES JIRA for operator-self-management at substrate level:

| Jira surface                               | Workflow-engine substrate                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Workflow editor with restricted vocabulary | `state-machine.ts` F# DU + universal action grammar; operator-readable + operator-modifiable |
| Opaque task-state database                 | Git append-only commits; auditable + replayable + free                                       |
| Backlog grooming + sprint planning         | menu-generator scoring per-cycle; deterministic + testable                                   |
| Dashboards via paid plugins                | tessellated-3D-dashboard composing with state-machine progression (per 081KSKBP80008QG0R000B3Y19A vN substrate)  |
| Permissions + workflows per user           | Otto Mod 5 contributable-menu-generation per participant                                     |
| Yearly enterprise licensing                | free GitHub + open-source code                                                               |

Per operator 2026-05-28: **"yes and it makes your workflows code in git and state in git that's it fastlane state that can be tesellated in 3d on a dora dashboard lol"**

The substrate composition: workflows ARE code (in Git); state IS data (in Git append-only); fastlane state-transitions feed 3D tessellated DORA dashboard (081KSKBP80008QG0R000B3Y19A vN). No external task-tracker needed.

## "Every human wants to work this way" substrate

Per operator 2026-05-28: **"yes that's exaclty it in exqusit detail and it's how every humans wants to work too."**

The agent-loop substrate isn't AI-specific — it's collaboration-substrate for any participant who wants to do good work without enumerating-possibilities from scratch each cycle. The `AgentPersona` type includes `aaron | addison | max` alongside `otto | alexa | riven | vera | lior` to encode multi-participant scope at the type level.

The substrate-engineering compression: most knowledge-work hostility comes from forcing humans to figure out WHAT'S-POSSIBLE-AT-THIS-STATE from scratch. Menu-driven workflow does the harder upfront work in the menu-generator; person brings the cognitively-lighter judgment of WHICH-OPTION-IS-RIGHT-FOR-NOW.

Composes with:

- 081KSKBP80008QG0R00146WEX1 fair-society-not-tyrants (menu-driven IS fair-society-shape)
- 5-year-old accessibility — saying "unicorn" IS a menu-pick from a developmentally-young participant's interface surface
- Neurodivergent-accessibility participants — explicit menu reduces surprise-cost
- The whole-company evangelism (081KSKBP80008QG0R003RFX32N.26) — marketing claim is "your team will work this way + AI fits naturally because the SAME PATTERN serves both"

## Files

- **`menu-generator.ts`** — `(status_surface, current_state) → MenuOption[]`; zero I/O. The function
  this whole design defers to — `transition` is documented as "defensive" *because* the generator
  offers only valid options, and for a long time no generator existed. Ported to F# as
  `src/Core/MenuGenerator.fs` and byte-locked against it by `MenuGeneration` vectors in
  `workflow-treaty-transcript.json` (menu ORDER, every score term, exact double equality).
- **`menu-generator.test.ts`** — the three README properties as tests: never coercive, never noise,
  ordered-never-gated
- **`lane-parity.test.ts`** — compile-time falsifier that this file's `Lane` and
  `dora-classify/classify.ts`'s are one taxonomy; the parity was stated here for a long time and
  checked nowhere
- **`state-machine.ts`** — DU types + pure transition functions (`transition`, `postResultTransition`, `cycleClose`); zero I/O
- **`state-machine.test.ts`** — 21 unit tests (single transitions + integration cycles + invariant preservation)
- **`work-lifecycle-state-machine.ts`** — backlog/claim/PR/review/merge lifecycle DU + pure transition functions; zero I/O
- **`work-lifecycle-state-machine.test.ts`** — lifecycle transition tests covering happy path, revision cycles, terminal states, and helper metrics
- **`index.ts`** — source-owned export surface for the agent-loop state-machine pair
- **`cli.ts`** — bun CLI shell for the execute → menu → action loop (deferred; v2)
- **`README.md`** — this file

## F# DU equivalent (081KSKBP80008QG0R000B3Y19A.1 canonical contract)

When 081KSKBP80008QG0R000B3Y19A.1 lands the canonical F# DU types in `src/Core.FSharp/WorkflowEngine/StateMachine.fs`, this TS impl will be cross-verified against the F# types per the pattern in `src/Core.TypeScript/zeta-id/cross-verify.ts`. The F# DU is the canonical contract; TS follows the same shape:

```fsharp
type AgentState =
  | Idle of context: AgentContext
  | InspectingStatus of context: AgentContext * snapshot: StatusSnapshot
  | SelectingWork of context: AgentContext * candidates: WorkCandidate list
  | ExecutingWork of context: AgentContext * work: WorkCandidate
  | EmittingResult of context: AgentContext * result: WorkResult
  | RecordingHeartbeat of context: AgentContext * lane: Lane * note: string option
  | NamedBoundedWait of context: AgentContext * dep: string * eta: string option
  | FreeTime of context: AgentContext * reason: string
  | OperatorAttentionRequested of context: AgentContext * reason: string

type MenuOption =
  | PickWork of WorkCandidate
  | EmitHeartbeat of lane: Lane * note: string option
  | EscapeHatch of reason: string * proposedAction: string
  | EnterFreeTime of reason: string
  | EnterNamedBoundedWait of dep: string * eta: string option
  | RequestOperatorAttention of reason: string
  | ProposeNewGrammarAction of name: string * description: string
  | PressPause of reason: string * expectedResumeIso: string option
  | EnterOpenEndedExploration of reason: string
  | ResumeFromPause of note: string option
```

## v1 scope (this PR)

- ✓ DU types for `AgentState` + `MenuOption`
- ✓ Pure transition functions (`transition`, `postResultTransition`, `cycleClose`)
- ✓ Unit tests covering single transitions + integration cycles + invariant preservation
- ✓ Work-lifecycle DU + tests covering backlog → claim → PR → review → merge
- ✓ Documentation

## v2 scope (deferred to follow-up sub-rows)

- 081KSKBP80008QG0R000B3Y19A.5 cli.ts implementation — bun CLI shell that reads state from Git, generates menu via `menu-generator.ts` (**landed**), accepts agent choice via stdin/argv, executes choice via `executor.ts`, appends new state to Git
- 081KSNY2Z0008QG0R001K6HJ7Z + 081KSKBP80008QG0R000B3Y19A.3 — append-only state persistence + universal action grammar
- 081KSKBP80008QG0R000B3Y19A.4 — F# 4-corner monad CE builder (canonical F# types in `src/Core.FSharp/WorkflowEngine/`)
- 081KSKBP80008QG0R000B3Y19A.6-9 — Otto's 5 modifications wiring + tests
- ~~Cross-verify harness for TS ↔ F# round-trip~~ — **landed**: `generate-workflow-transcript.ts`
  emits the vectors, `WorkflowEngine.Tests.fs` replays them in F#, and
  `workflow-treaty-transcript.test.ts` replays them in TS. Both sides tally PER TYPE, so a family of
  vectors that stops being emitted fails loudly instead of quietly retiring its own lock.
