// ace-node-runtime-parity.test.ts — the falsifier for "ace runs on plain node".
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `ace` is the one-liner installer's payload. Aaron's runtime
// ladder puts *recompile-from-source* above *download a trusted binary*, because
// "source you recompile is source you can verify; a prebuilt binary is bytes you must
// trust" (docs/DECISIONS/2026-08-24-ace-runtime-selection-is-a-declared-cost-model-not-a-preference-list.md).
// Today the only shippable ace artifact is a 61 MiB `bun build --compile` binary. A
// host that already has node can instead run the source it already cloned — but only
// while node's ESM resolver can resolve every specifier in ace's runtime closure.
//
// Node's ESM resolver requires an EXPLICIT file extension on relative specifiers.
// Bun's does not. So `import { x } from "./y"` runs fine under bun and dies under node
// with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND — and nothing in the bun-only test suite notices. That is
// the exact shape of a check that cannot fail: the node rung would silently rot back
// to broken on the next extensionless import anyone adds.
//
// TWO GUARDS, deliberately not one:
//   (1) STATIC  — no relative specifier in ace's runtime closure may be extensionless.
//                 Names the offending file:specifier, so a regression is a one-line fix.
//   (2) DYNAMIC — the same ace commands, run under bun and under node, must produce
//                 BYTE-IDENTICAL stdout and the same exit code. "node runs it" is worth
//                 much less than "node produces identical output" — the second is what
//                 makes the source rung a substitute for the binary rung rather than a
//                 second, differently-behaving ace.
//
// NODE IS REQUIRED, NOT OPTIONAL. `.mise.toml` pins Node 24 as a first-class toolchain
// and `package.json`'s `typecheck` script executes `node` directly. So a missing node is
// a broken environment, and this test FAILS rather than skipping: a check that did not
// run must never look like one that passed.
