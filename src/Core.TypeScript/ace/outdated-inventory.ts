// outdated-inventory.ts -- what this tree PINS, per ecosystem, read from committed text only.
//
// The first half of `ace outdated`. This module answers exactly one question -- "what version of
// each dependency is this tree currently pinned to?" -- and it answers it with no network, no
// package manager, and no resolver. Every parser here takes TEXT and returns rows; the only
// filesystem access is `collectPinned`, which reads the committed manifests through safe-io.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT `hygiene/unhashed-inventory.ts`
// ----------------------------------------------
// That module already walks every dependency mechanism in the tree, and it is the right module
// for the question it asks: IS THIS DEPENDENCY CONTENT-PINNED? Its rows carry a `coverage`
// (`digest` / `tag-only` / `unpinned` / `undeclared`) and, for whole mechanisms, an aggregate
// subject like `"131 integrity-covered package(s)"`. That is a complete answer about digests and
// deliberately not an answer about VERSIONS -- a row standing for 131 packages has no version to
// compare, and it does not need one.
//
// `ace outdated` needs the other axis: a (name, version) pair per dependency, canonical enough to
// key a registry lookup. So this module is a SECOND READING of some of the same files, not a
// second copy of that one. Nothing here reports digest coverage, and nothing there reports
// versions; where they overlap on a file, they extract disjoint fields.
//
// WHY HAND PARSERS
// ----------------
// Same reasoning `parseDeclaredTools` states for `.mise.toml`: a parser that understands exactly
// the shapes this repo uses FAILS LOUDLY on a shape it does not (the row is simply not produced,
// so the dependency shows up nowhere and its absence is visible in the counts), whereas a general
// parser accepts a shape the comparison cannot handle and reports a confident wrong answer.
//
// The mise parser is not hand-rolled here at all -- it is imported from
// `../ci/toolchain-manifest.ts`, which already parses the same table for the pin-parity check.
//
// Rule 0: TypeScript, no .sh.
