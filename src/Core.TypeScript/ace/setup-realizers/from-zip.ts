// from-zip — a pinned per-platform release ZIP, extracted into a declared directory.
//
// THE GAP IT CLOSES. `from-url` puts ONE FILE at ONE PATH; it cannot unpack, and the tree
// already recorded that as a blocker in `tools/setup/manifests/windows`: "from-url can
// DOWNLOAD a file but never unpack or install one … (a) a Windows-side unzip-to-PATH
// mechanism (new mechanism -- needs sign-off)". A vendor that ships a self-contained
// toolchain publishes a per-platform ZIP and nothing else, so until now such a tool could
// only arrive by hand — which is how the CodeQL CLI came to sit at ~/.zeta/codeql-cli on
// exactly one machine, pinned by nothing and reproducible by nobody.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, and the omissions are deliberate:
//
//   * IT DOES NOT ADOPT WHAT IT FINDS. A destination that exists but carries no receipt is
//     re-installed from the pin, not blessed. `install-pinned-smt.ts` and `from-url` both
//     make the same call for the same reason: present is not correct, and adopting an
//     unidentified tree is how "pinned" becomes a word rather than a property.
//   * IT DOES NOT DEFAULT TO INSTALLING. `opt-in=` is required per row and its absence is a
//     THROW, not a default — a mechanism whose artifacts are hundreds of megabytes cannot
//     have "install everywhere" as its failure mode.
//   * IT DOES NOT WRITE OUTSIDE `<dest>` AND THE SHIM DIR. No PATH edits, no profile edits.
//
// THE RECEIPT IS THE WHOLE IDEMPOTENCY STORY. Extraction destroys the artifact whose digest
// was verified, so `<dest>/.zeta-from-zip.json` records the URL and digest that produced the
// tree. A re-run re-installs when the receipt is absent, unreadable, or disagrees with the
// row — and that third case is the one that matters, because it is what makes a pin bump
// actually change the machine instead of merely changing the manifest.
