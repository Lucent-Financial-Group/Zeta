// rolling-exception.ts — the DECLARED, RECORDED exception that lets one rolling
// `from-url` row auto-accept rebuilt bytes instead of wedging `install.sh`.
//
// THE MAINTAINER'S RULING, 2026-09-09, verbatim:
//
//   "okay i think we can just allow for the roll and update for now, i know
//    that is not great from a security point of view but this is not a
//    permanent fix, it just until we don't need the new features anymore, we
//    are going to need this exception path we can just save the exceptions
//    somewhere and let it not break install.sh."
//
// Three things in that sentence shape every decision in this file, and none of
// them is "turn the check off":
//
//   1. "we can just save the exceptions SOMEWHERE" — the exception is DATA, in
//      a committed, reviewable, per-ref manifest. Not a flag, not an env var,
//      not a `--force`. A blanket "ignore mismatches" switch does not exist
//      here and must never be added: `activeExceptionFor` matches ONE dest
//      exactly, and everything without a row keeps failing closed.
//   2. "not a permanent fix" — every row carries `expires=`, and an expired row
//      does not auto-accept AND turns the gate red
//      (`hygiene/lint-rolling-exceptions.ts`). The expiry is mechanical, not a
//      comment somebody is supposed to notice.
//   3. "let it not break install.sh" — the scope is PROVISIONING. This buys a
//      machine that finishes installing. It does not, and must not, buy a green
//      verifier claim: see THE SECURITY TRADEOFF below.
//
// ── WHAT AUTO-ACCEPT ACTUALLY COSTS ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Stated plainly because the maintainer made this call knowingly and it is not
// the reader's job to reconstruct it. While an exception is live, WHOEVER CAN
// CHOOSE THE BYTES BEHIND THAT URL CHOOSES THE VERIFIER THIS REPO RUNS. For
// `src/Core.TLA/tla2tools.jar` that is anyone who can publish to the tlaplus
// release tag, plus anyone who can forge the TLS-terminated response to it. A
// hostile build could report every model as passing, and the digest — which is
// the only thing that ever said which bytes arrived — would no longer refuse
// it. That is the price of the row, it is real, and it is bounded only by the
// expiry date and by the fact that exactly one row exists.
//
// WHAT IS NOT GIVEN UP, and this is why the trade is takeable:
//
//   * The record. Every acceptance appends a line to the local ledger naming
//     both digests, the clock, and whether a verification ran and what it said.
//     An auto-accept with no record would convert a LOUD failure into a SILENT
//     one, which is strictly worse than the thing it replaces.
//   * The pin. The manifest still pins the old digest, and every downstream
//     restatement of it (`registry/tlc-models.json` versionBanner, the docs)
//     still disagrees with the accepted bytes and still says so. The verifier
//     lane stays red until somebody runs `repin-rolling.ts`, which re-measures.
//     So provisioning is unblocked and NO CLAIM IS LAUNDERED.
//   * Fail-closed everywhere else. No exception row, an expired one, a
//     malformed digest, a non-rolling row, or a transport failure: all still
//     throw. The hole is exactly one declared ref wide.

 * whole row minus its clock: same dest, same digests, same verdict, same
 * outcome ⇒ the same fact, already recorded.
 *
 * ── CONCURRENCY, STATED RATHER THAN ASSUMED ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This ledger is written by `install.sh`, and parallel CI jobs share a runner
 * and a checkout. So two writers can be inside this function at once, and the
 * two halves behave differently under that:
 *
 *   * THE WRITE IS ATOMIC. `appendFileSync` opens `O_APPEND` and issues one
 *     `write(2)`, so the kernel places it at the end atomically. Two concurrent
 *     writers produce two whole lines, never one interleaved line. That is the
 *     property that actually matters -- a torn record would be worse than a
 *     duplicate one.
 *   * THE DEDUP IS ADVISORY. It is a read followed by a write, so two writers
 *     can both read "absent" and both append. The result is a duplicate row,
 *     which costs a line of noise and loses nothing: the ledger is a record of
 *     what happened, and the same fact recorded twice is still true. Closing
 *     that window needs a lock file, and a lock in the install path is a worse
 *     trade than a repeated line.
 *
 * So the guarantee is: **apply-N-times has the same EFFECT as apply-once for a
 * single writer, and degrades to at-most-one-duplicate-per-racing-writer.** Said
 * out loud because "idempotent" unqualified would be a stronger claim than the
 * code earns.
 *
 * The header is created with `wx` -- an atomic create-if-absent -- rather than
 * an existence check followed by a write, which would be both a check-then-use
 * race (CWE-367) and a way for two starters to each stamp a header.
