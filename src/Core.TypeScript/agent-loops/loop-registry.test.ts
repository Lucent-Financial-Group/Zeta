// loop-registry.test.ts — the falsifiers.
//
// Two properties carry this module, and both are easy to assert vacuously.
//
//   1. EXIT IS THE AGENT'S ALONE. A test that only checks "the agent can leave" passes on an
//      implementation where anyone can evict anyone. The falsifier has to be the REFUSAL of a
//      third-party deregistration, not the acceptance of a self-deregistration.
//   2. BOUNDED MEANS IT STOPS BY ITSELF. A test that enrols and immediately asks "is it active"
//      never exercises exhaustion at all, and would pass on an unbounded implementation. The
//      falsifier is a tick number PAST the budget with nothing else happening.
//
// The third property is the one the module exists for: a deregistered agent and an exhausted agent
// are BOTH silent, and the registry must say which is which.
