/**
 * audit-heartbeat-lane-attestations.ts — the falsifier for the PR-free heartbeat lane.
 *
 * Design: docs/research/2026-08-25-pr-free-heartbeat-lane-attestation-instead-of-gate.md
 * Registry (the blast radius, as data): registry/heartbeat-lane-allowlist.json
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS EXISTS BEFORE THE THING IT AUDITS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The lane's proposal is that a bypass actor pushes heartbeat telemetry straight to `main`,
 * skipping `gate (required)`, and that the lane "verifies itself". A bypass actor is a
 * permanent hole: whatever authenticates as it can push unchecked. So the self-verification
 * has to be a CHECKABLE FACT rather than a claim, or it is exactly the vacuity this
 * repository exists to refuse — a check that did not run, wearing the clothes of one that
 * passed.
 *
 * This auditor is the checking half. It reads commits that landed on `main` and asks, of
 * every commit the lane produced:
 *
 *   1. Does it carry a Verification-Attestation block at all?
 *   2. Is that attestation bound to THIS commit's content — `Verification-Subject` must be
 *      the commit's own tree sha — or was it copied from a commit that really was verified?
 *   3. Does it name the checks the registry REQUIRES, using only vocabulary the registry
 *      KNOWS? (A lane cannot pass by naming fewer checks, or by inventing a weaker name.)
 *   4. Does every path it touches sit inside the allowlist, in a permitted change mode?
 *      `append-only` is verified as PREFIX PRESERVATION on the actual blobs, not as
 *      "the diff removed no lines" — a unified diff with zero deletions still permits a
 *      rewrite interleaved among surviving lines.
 *   5. Is it inside the size budget?
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE HONEST LIMITS, STATED HERE RATHER THAN DISCOVERED LATER
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * (a) `agencysignature-block.ts` records that a parser cannot distinguish a COPIED
 *     attestation from an EARNED one, because a copy is byte-identical to the original.
 *     `Verification-Subject` fixes exactly half of that and no more: it binds the
 *     attestation to the commit's own tree, so an attestation lifted from a genuinely
 *     verified commit fails on a different tree. It does NOT stop an actor that already
 *     holds the push credential from computing the right tree sha and writing a fresh
 *     lie. Nothing parseable can. The defence against a FORGED (as opposed to copied)
 *     attestation is that the verifier is a different actor from the writer — design doc
 *     section 5 — and this auditor cannot verify that separation from the commit object.
 *
 * (b) Offline, "is this a lane commit" is decided by the author/committer email, which is
 *     attacker-chosen. `--online` cross-checks the forge's own rule-suites ledger, which
 *     records the actor of every ruleset bypass and is not written by the pusher. That
 *     ledger only exists if `bypass_mode` is `always`; GitHub documents `exempt` as
 *     creating no audit entry, which is why the design forbids `exempt`.
 *
 * (c) A green run here means "no lane commit on `main` in the window violated the
 *     registry". It does not mean the lane's own pre-push checks ran. That is the
 *     actuator-verification gap named in
 *     docs/research/2026-08-18-forge-agnostic-drift-checks-*.md section 5b, and it is not
 *     closed here.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun src/Core.TypeScript/hygiene/audit-heartbeat-lane-attestations.ts
 *   bun ... --since 2026-08-01            # window (default: 14 days)
 *   bun ... --max 300                     # last N commits instead of a date window
 *   bun ... --commit <SHA>                # one commit
 *   bun ... --branch main                 # default: origin/main if present, else HEAD
 *   bun ... --cutover 2026-08-01T00:00:00Z  # override registry cutoverIso
 *   bun ... --online                      # also read the forge bypass ledger
 *   bun ... --registry <path>
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 — no violations (OK / NOT-LANE / PRE-CUTOVER-LEGACY only)
 *   1 — at least one violation
 *   2 — tooling / input error
