/**
 * src/Core.TypeScript/hygiene/audit-observability-chain.ts
 *
 * Refuses an observability pipeline that LOOKS configured and moves nothing.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-20, Dejan). Three findings landed together, and
 * all three are one class: a values-only change that nothing renders and
 * nothing asserts.
 *
 *   1. Alloy ran as a DaemonSet on every node with three components in its
 *      config -- loki.write, otelcol.exporter.otlp, prometheus.remote_write.
 *      ALL THREE ARE SINKS. Zero sources. Three pipelines with an output and
 *      no input, under a header claiming it shipped logs, metrics and traces.
 *   2. Its Loki sink named http://loki.loki.svc:3100. Rendering the loki
 *      chart in the configured SimpleScalable mode produces loki-backend,
 *      -canary, -gateway, -memberlist, -read, -write and NO Service named
 *      loki. A one-word error nothing in the repo could see.
 *   3. The rendered Alertmanager config had ONE receiver, named null, and
 *      the default route pointed at it. 35 rule groups fired into it.
 *
 * None of the three is a syntax error, a schema violation, or a bad chart
 * pin, so helm template, kubeconform and yamllint are all green on all of
 * them. This audit is the check that is not.
 *
 * EXTENDED 2026-08-20 (Dejan) with the two links the first pass NAMED and did
 * not close. Same class, one layer further out:
 *
 *   4. NOTHING IN ZETA WAS SCRAPED. Zero ServiceMonitors, zero PodMonitors,
 *      zero PrometheusRules authored anywhere in the repo -- all 35 rule
 *      groups were chart defaults watching kubelet, etcd and CoreDNS. No Zeta
 *      workload declared a metrics port or carried a prometheus.io/scrape
 *      annotation, so the annotation path Alloy had just grown had no users.
 *   5. THE VACUOUS ALERT. An alert or dashboard referencing a metric no Zeta
 *      source emits is a check that cannot fire -- it looks like coverage and
 *      constrains nothing. This is the same defect as a sink with no source,
 *      moved from the transport layer to the query layer, and it is the more
 *      valuable half because a rule is what a human trusts at 3am.
 *
 * EXTENDED 2026-08-21 (shadow) with the link BOTH earlier passes left open:
 *
 *   6. THE SERVICEMONITOR ITSELF WAS NEVER FOLLOWED TO A SERVICE. The audit
 *      proved the ruler selects the object (rule 7) and that Argo applies the
 *      file (rule 8), and never asked whether the selector matches a Service or
 *      whether endpoints[].port names a port that Service declares. Measured
 *      before rule 9 existed: four independent ways of severing the portal
 *      scrape -- renaming the Service port, a selector label no Service
 *      carries, the wrong namespace, and a port NUMBER where a port NAME is
 *      required -- each left the audit printing "PASS: 7 invariants hold".
 *      A ServiceMonitor that resolves to nothing yields a scrape job with zero
 *      endpoints, and zero endpoints is not a DOWN target, it is NO target: the
 *      series is absent rather than 0, so a health panel counting up{} stays
 *      green while nothing is collected.
 *
 * Two silent-ignore traps come with them, and both are refused below because
 * both produce an object that applies cleanly and is never evaluated:
 *   - a ServiceMonitor/PrometheusRule missing the release label the chart's
 *     default selector requires;
 *   - a manifest sitting in an Argo Application directory whose `include`
 *     filter does not match it, so Argo never applies the file at all.

/**
 * Rule 9 -- a ServiceMonitor must actually RESOLVE to a Service, at a port
 * name that Service declares.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS THE SHARPEST REMAINING CASE. A ServiceMonitor IS a scrape
 * target -- the literal subject of this file's opening sentence -- and until
 * now it was the one link nothing checked. Rule 7 proves the ruler SELECTS
 * the object; rule 8 proves Argo APPLIES the file. Neither asks the only
 * question that decides whether a single byte moves: does the selector match a
 * Service, and does `endpoints[].port` name a port that Service declares?
 *
 * `endpoints[].port` is a **Service port name**, not a container port name and
 * not a number. Get it wrong and prometheus-operator emits a scrape job whose
 * endpoint role selects zero addresses. The result is worse than a broken
 * target: the job does not appear as DOWN on the targets page, it does not
 * appear AT ALL -- so `up` is not 0, it is absent, and a dashboard counting
 * healthy targets stays green. That is this repo's defining failure mode --
 * green meaning "nothing reported" -- at the one layer that had no guard.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-08-21 before this rule existed: renaming the portal Service
 * port `metrics` -> `http-metrics`, pointing the selector at a label no Service
 * carries, naming a namespace the Service is not in, and replacing the port
 * name with the number 8080 ALL left the audit reporting "PASS: 7 invariants
 * hold". Four ways to sever the scrape, zero of them visible.
 *
 * SOUNDNESS. Candidate Services are matched on `selector.matchLabels` only.
 * `matchExpressions` can merely NARROW the matched set, so the candidate set
 * computed here is a superset of the true one -- which makes every failure
 * below a real failure (no false positives) while leaving the rule incomplete
 * against selectors that rely on matchExpressions alone.
 *
 * SCOPE, and it is the same scope `checkScrapeOptIn` already uses: a
 * ServiceMonitor authored HERE must target a Service authored HERE. A
 * chart-rendered workload's ServiceMonitor is that chart's job to ship, and
 * the roster carries port NUMBERS only, so it cannot answer a port-NAME
 * question. Named limits, not silent ones: PodMonitor is not modelled (the
 * tree authors none, and an unexercised branch is the vacuity this audit
 * exists to refuse), and an endpoint selecting by `targetPort` rather than
 * `port` is left unjudged rather than guessed at.
