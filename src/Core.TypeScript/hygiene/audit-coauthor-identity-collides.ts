// audit-coauthor-identity-collides.ts — AH005: a committed identity that GitHub resolves
// to somebody who is not us.
//
// The rule this enforces
// ----------------------
// GitHub renders a `Co-authored-by:` trailer, and a commit's author/committer identity, by
// resolving the EMAIL to an account. For the `users.noreply.github.com` domain there are
// three shapes, and exactly one of them is unsafe:
//
//   <id>+<username>@users.noreply.github.com   SAFE  — the numeric id must match the
//                                                      username, so it cannot be squatted.
//   <username>[bot]@users.noreply.github.com   SAFE  — a GitHub username cannot contain
//                                                      `[`, so it resolves to nobody.
//   <username>@users.noreply.github.com        UNSAFE — the LEGACY plain form. GitHub
//                                                      resolves it directly to whoever
//                                                      owns that username, today.
//
// A persona name that is also an ordinary first name therefore attributes our work to a
// stranger. This is not hypothetical: two personas of ours shipped commits under the plain
// form and both local-parts are live accounts belonging to uninvolved private individuals
// (one registered 2008, one 2011). 15 commits under one, 2 under the other. Neither person
// did anything; we named them. That is the whole harm, and it is a real one even though
// nothing was compromised — no breach, no false contribution in the REST
// `/contributors` payload, but the repository's Contributors sidebar (which DOES aggregate
// trailer co-authors, where the REST endpoint does not) renders them.
//
// The `[bot]` suffix is what the fleet's machine lanes already use, and it is safe for a
// structural reason rather than a lucky one: a GitHub username CANNOT contain `[`, so
// `otto[bot]@users.noreply.github.com` can never resolve to an account. That is the form
// to standardise on, and this audit accepts it.
//
// TWO CLASSES, NOT ONE. Do not conflate them:
//
//   COLLIDES  (class 1) — `<name>@users.noreply.github.com`, no `+`, no `[`. HARMFUL:
//                         resolves to a real stranger. This is the defect that was found.
//   FABRICATED(class 2) — an invented, unresolvable namespace (`@zeta.agents`,
//                         `@zeta.local`, `.invalid`, ...). LESSER: GitHub can match it to
//                         nobody, so it misattributes to no one. It is an inconsistency,
//                         and it is reported separately for that reason.
//
// Scope, and its limitation — say this out loud
// ---------------------------------------------
// This audit scans the SOURCES THAT GENERATE identities. It does NOT scan git history, on
// purpose. The offending commits are already on `main`; correcting them would mean
// rewriting published history and force-pushing the default branch, which is forbidden
// here. An audit pointed at history would therefore be permanently red over a set of
// commits nobody is allowed to fix — and a check that can never go green is a check
// somebody eventually disables. So the fix is FORWARD-ONLY and so is the check: the past
// stays as it is, and no NEW generator can introduce the form.
//
// The cost of that scoping, stated rather than hidden: a trailer typed by hand into a PR
// body or a squash message, with no generator in the tree, is invisible here. The
// convention surfaces that agents copy from (the PR template, the harness bootstraps, the
// skills) ARE in scope, which is the reachable half.
//
// Also out of scope by design, each for a reason a reviewer can check:
//   * `*.test.ts` / `*.spec.ts` — fixtures reproduce the defect on purpose (including this
//     audit's own), and flagging them would make the falsifier unwritable. Tests do not
//     push commits.
//   * comment lines in shell / YAML / TS (`#`, `//`, `*`) — a lane must be able to DOCUMENT
//     the banned form beside the code that avoids it. NOT applied to markdown, where `#` is
//     a heading and `*` a bullet, and where a bullet showing a trailer to copy is precisely
//     the generator class this exists to catch.
//   * `SELF_EXEMPT` — one file, this one, which must print the offending form in its own
//     findings text. The test pins that the list has exactly that one entry.
//
// The vacuity this closes
// -----------------------
// `agency-signature-identity-roster.json` already enumerates machine-lane identities, and
// `audit-agencysignature-main-tip.ts` already reasons about co-author trailers — but both
// ask WHO signed, never whether the address they signed with points at somebody else. An
// identity check that validates every field except the one that decides attribution reads
// as coverage and constrains nothing.
//
// Rule 0: TypeScript (no .sh) per `.claude/rules.bak/rule-0-no-sh-files.md`.
//
// Usage:
//   bun src/Core.TypeScript/hygiene/audit-coauthor-identity-collides.ts
//   bun src/Core.TypeScript/hygiene/audit-coauthor-identity-collides.ts --json
//
// Exit codes:
//   0   every generated identity is unambiguous
//   1   at least one generator emits a colliding or fabricated identity
//   2   configuration error (no scan root resolved)
