// audit-mise-lock-coverage.ts — the committed mise digests are OURS, and stay ours.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES (081M24MADR2087G0R001FCD8K6, measured 2026-09-10).
// There was no `mise.lock` in the tree, so the `[2/3] checksum` step every `mise install`
// prints was verified against a checksum FETCHED FROM UPSTREAM AT INSTALL TIME. Across the
// ~24 tool pins in `.mise.toml` + `.mise.full.toml`, not one digest was one we owned. The
// day GitHub's attestation service returned 503 (`trust-metadata-api service unavailable`)
// both ARM lanes on `main` died on `kubeconform@0.7.0` — after the checksum step had
// already passed. Integrity was established; the install died on an AVAILABILITY check
// layered over it, because neither of the two trust sources was in this repository.
//
// `mise.lock` / `mise.full.lock` are now committed and this audit is what keeps them
// meaning something. Four things it refuses, each of which was measured to be possible:
//
//   1. A CONFIG PIN THAT MOVED WITHOUT A RE-LOCK. `zig = "0.13.0"` -> `"0.14.0"` with a
//      stale lockfile is a one-line diff that reads as housekeeping. Under `locked = true`
//      it breaks every install in the fleet; without this check it breaks them AFTER merge.
//   2. A TOOL THAT LOST ITS COVERAGE. A platform silently dropping out of the lockfile is
//      invisible in review — the file is 600 lines of generated TOML.
//   3. `locked = true` GOING MISSING from `.mise.toml`. Measured: with `locked = false`
//      (the default) mise still verifies digests it HAS, but silently ADDS a missing
//      platform entry from upstream and rewrites the lockfile in place. A lockfile that
//      repairs itself is not a lock — it is a cache that looks like one.
//   4. THE EXEMPTION ROSTER GROWING. Six backends emit no lockable artifact at all
//      (`core:dotnet`, `core:rust`, `npm:`, `pipx:`) and one emits a URL with no digest
//      (`vfox:1password-cli`). Under `locked = true` those PASS THROUGH — measured, not
//      assumed — so `locked = true` does NOT mean "everything is locked". They are named
//      below with reasons, and this audit fails BOTH ways: a roster tool that is not
//      declared, and a roster tool that has since become lockable and should be dropped
//      from the roster. The exemption set can shrink; it cannot grow without a diff here.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: prove the digests are right. Only a real fetch can, and that is
// `.github/workflows/verify-mise-lock.yml` — a re-lock on the PINNED mise compared through
// `--relock-diff` below, plus a tampered-digest run that MUST be refused.
//
// Run:   bun src/Core.TypeScript/hygiene/audit-mise-lock-coverage.ts
//        bun src/Core.TypeScript/hygiene/audit-mise-lock-coverage.ts --relock-diff <a> <b>
// Exit:  0 — every declared tool is locked, or named on the roster with a reason
//        1 — drift, lost coverage, a missing `locked = true`, or a stale roster entry

 *
 *   dotnet   `core:dotnet` shells out to Microsoft's `dotnet-install` script, which
 *            resolves and verifies its own payload. mise never sees a URL to lock.
 *   rust     `core:rust` drives rustup. The rustup INSTALLER is digest-pinned by us
 *            (`tools/setup/rustup-pin.json`, verify-rustup-pin.yml); the toolchain it
 *            then fetches is verified by rustup's own signed channel manifests.
 *   npm:*    installs through npm's own resolver. `package.json` + `bun.lock` is that
 *            ecosystem's lock, and mise 2026.6.12+ additionally enforces aube's
 *            publisher-trust policy on the tree (the `fastq@1.20.2` note in `.mise.toml`).
 *   pipx:*   routed through `uv tool install` against PyPI. No single artifact URL exists
 *            to pin — the install is a resolved dependency set, not a download.
 *
 * HONEST STATEMENT OF WHAT THAT COSTS: for these seven tools the digest is still not ours.
 * `locked = true` does not fail closed on them — measured, `mise install` proceeds and
 * installs them unlocked — so the guarantee this file's header claims is a guarantee about
 * the OTHER fourteen. Closing these is separate work per ecosystem, not a mise setting.
