// fsharp-mutation-probe.ts — a minimal MUTATION probe for F#, because Stryker cannot do F#.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//   On 2026-08-01 four independent "could-not-fail" defects were found by hand across four
//   subsystems — tests and checks that pass no matter what the code does. One was already in
//   financial code (`MoneyVelocityOracle.regimeTable` asserted a literal instead of calling the
//   classifier beside it). A financial audit is upcoming, and F# is where the money code lives:
//   MoneyVelocityOracle.fs, AskBidClearing.fs, Web3Settlement.fs.
//
//   The repo already runs mutation testing — `.github/workflows/stryker-mutation.yml` — but only
//   over `src/Core.CSharp/**`, and the workflow itself records why it cannot expand:
//       "throws NotSupportedException: Language not supported: Fsharp"
//   So the highest-stakes code has the weakest could-not-fail coverage.
//
// WHY NOT A LINT (measured, not assumed)
//   Three textual signatures were tried against the real tree first:
//     - assertion comparing a value to itself      →   0 hits (pattern absent in F#)
//     - `[<Fact>]` with no assertion               → 183 hits; sampled 2, BOTH false positives
//                                                    (they delegate to assertion helpers)
//     - unused `_`-prefixed parameters             →   3 files (negligible yield in F#)
//   A detector that cries wolf 183 times is itself a could-not-fail tool: nobody reads it. The
//   property that matters — DOES THE OUTPUT DEPEND ON THE INPUT — is semantic, not textual.
//   Mutation is the only honest way to ask it.
//
// WHAT IT DOES
//   For a target .fs file: apply one small semantic mutation, rebuild, run a filtered test set.
//     test suite still PASSES  ⇒ MUTANT SURVIVED ⇒ nothing checks that behaviour  (the finding)
//     test suite FAILS         ⇒ mutant killed   ⇒ the behaviour is genuinely covered
//
// HONEST SCOPE
//   - Slow: one rebuild per mutant. This is a PROBE for high-value files, not a CI gate.
//   - Textual mutation, not AST-aware — it can produce a mutant that does not compile. Those are
//     reported as INVALID and excluded from the score rather than counted as killed, because
//     counting them as killed would inflate the result (the exact overclaim this guards against).
//   - The file is ALWAYS restored, including on crash (try/finally).
//
// Usage:  bun src/Core.TypeScript/hygiene/fsharp-mutation-probe.ts <file.fs> <testFilter> [--limit N]
//         <testFilter> is an xUnit method pattern (`*Tlc*`, wildcards at either end), passed as
//         `--filter-method`. The legacy VSTest form `FullyQualifiedName~X` is still accepted and
//         means `*X*`; any other VSTest filter expression is refused rather than guessed at.
// Exit:   0 — every mutant killed (or none applicable)
//         1 — at least one mutant SURVIVED (a could-not-fail region exists)
//         2 — the probe never ran: bad usage, or the UNMUTATED baseline did not pass
//
// WHY THE BASELINE RUN (added with the move to Microsoft.Testing.Platform, 2026-09-23)
//   `dotnet test` runs in MTP mode (global.json `test.runner`). There, a filter that matches
//   NO tests exits 8 — a failure. Every mutant would then read as KILLED and the probe would
//   report "all mutants killed" having tested nothing. (Under VSTest the same typo exited 0 and
//   every mutant read as SURVIVED: wrong, but loud.) So the unmutated file must pass first.
