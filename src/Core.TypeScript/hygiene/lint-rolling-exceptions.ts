// The falsifier for `tools/setup/manifests/from-url-rolling-exceptions`.
//
// An exception with no enforcement is a licence, so this is the enforcement.
// The maintainer authorised auto-accept on a rolling `from-url` row as a
// TEMPORARY concession (2026-09-09: "this is not a permanent fix, it just until
// we don't need the new features anymore"). A concession whose temporariness
// lives in a comment is permanent — somebody has to notice a comment, and
// nobody does. So the expiry is a DATE THIS LINT ENFORCES, and the gate goes
// red on the day it passes.
//
// WHAT IT REFUSES, and each one is a hole somebody could otherwise widen:
//
//   1. an exception for a dest that is not a `rolling=` row in
//      `tools/setup/manifests/from-url`. On an IMMUTABLE upstream, changed
//      bytes are a supply-chain event, and auto-accepting one is the worst
//      thing this feature could ever be used for.
//   2. `accept=` anything but `auto`. A closed set of one. A typo must be a
//      refusal, never a fall-through to permissive.
//   3. a missing, malformed, or PAST `expires=`. Past ⇒ red gate.
//   4. `expires=` more than MAX_EXCEPTION_DAYS past `declared=`. Without this,
//      `expires=2099-01-01` is a permanent exception wearing a date.
//   5. a `declared=` in the future, or after `expires=`. A row that has not
//      started yet, or that expires before it begins, is a defect.
//   6. a missing `tradeoff=` doc, one that is not in the tree, one that does
//      not name the dest, or one that never states what an ATTACKER gains.
//      The maintainer made this call knowingly; the cost has to be written
//      down where the next reader finds it, or the knowledge dies with the
//      session that made it.
//   7. a missing `exitcheck=`, or one whose script is not in the tree. The
//      row's PREMISE must have a falsifier, not a paragraph.
//   8. `verify=` naming a script that is not in the tree. `deferred` is
//      allowed and is an honest answer; a path that does not resolve is not.
//   9. two rows for the same dest. Ambiguity is not a licence.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: run anything, or reach the network. It is
// an offline gate step. `exitcheck=` is RUN as its own gate step beside this
// one — a declared-but-never-executed check would be precisely the defect this
// file exists to prevent, one level up.
