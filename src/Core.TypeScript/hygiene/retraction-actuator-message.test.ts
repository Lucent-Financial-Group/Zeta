// Falsifiers for the retraction commit message (`retraction-actuator.ts`).
//
// WHY THIS IS ON THE COMMIT AND NOT ONLY THE PR BODY. The repository's
// `squash_merge_commit_message` is COMMIT_MESSAGES, so what lands on `main` is built
// from the branch's commit messages, not from the PR body. `git revert` writes no
// trailers of its own, so before 2026-08-22 a retraction would have arrived unsigned.
//
// The actuator's push path cannot be exercised end-to-end here — `push_retraction` is
// only emitted after `main` has been red for several consecutive ticks with no fleet
// heal in flight — so what IS testable is tested, and the rest is named as untested in
// the change that introduced it rather than implied to be covered.
