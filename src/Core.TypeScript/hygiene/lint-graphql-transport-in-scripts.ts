//
// A COMMITTED SCRIPT, WORKFLOW, OR AGENT LOOP THAT REACHES GITHUB OVER THE
// GRAPHQL TRANSPORT WHEN THE SAME FACT IS AVAILABLE OVER REST.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHAT IS NOT THE TARGET, SAID FIRST
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// A HUMAN TYPING `gh pr view 15673` AT A PROMPT IS NOT THE TARGET, and never
// will be. `gh pr view` is the right command for a person looking at a pull
// request: it is one call, it renders, and a human does not run it four
// hundred times an hour. Reading this lint as "the repo has banned gh" is a
// misreading that would get the lint deleted, so it is refused here in the
// first paragraph rather than in a footnote.
//
// The target is the COMMITTED, REPEATED, UNATTENDED call: a `.ts` an agent
// loop shells, a `run:` block in a workflow that fires on a cadence, a `.sh`
// in `tools/`. Those are the calls that multiply, and multiplication is the
// entire defect.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// `gh` has two backends and does not say which one it used. `gh pr view`,
// `gh pr list`, `gh pr checks` and `gh run view` are GRAPHQL. `gh api
// repos/{owner}/{repo}/...` is REST. GitHub meters them against TWO SEPARATE
// 5000/hour budgets, and in this repo they are not close to equally loaded:
//
//   * measured 2026-08-14 (recorded only as a code comment in
//     agent-heartbeats/merge-heartbeats-to-main.ts): GraphQL 1147/5000 points
//     against REST 33/5000 requests.
//   * measured 2026-08-25/26: agent polling drove GraphQL to 0/5000 WITHIN A
//     MINUTE of an hourly reset, twice, while REST was never contended.
//
// The trap is that the GraphQL commands are the ERGONOMIC ones. `gh pr view N
// --json state` is shorter than its REST spelling, reads better, and is what
// every example on the internet shows. So the cheap transport is the one you
// have to know about, and on 2026-08-25/26 FOUR AGENTS independently walked
// into the same wall in one evening. The knowledge existed -- in one docstring
// in one module -- and a docstring is read by whoever is editing that module,
// which is why it stopped four agents zero times.
//
// AND THE DRAIN IS OBSERVATION, NOT ACTION. Measured in the same hour: 7 lane
// runs and 11 PRs created, so auto-merge arming cost AT MOST 11 GraphQL
// mutations against 5000 -- about 0.2%. The budget was not spent doing things.
// It was spent looking.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE ONE OPERATION THAT MUST SPEND IT
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// `enablePullRequestAutoMerge` is GraphQL-ONLY. There is no REST equivalent,
// so `gh pr merge --auto` is not a finding here and must not become one: it is
// the single operation whose cost is unavoidable, and it is also rare and
// cheap. Every OTHER command this lint names has a REST form, printed in the
// refusal.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHAT THIS SEES, AND WHAT IT PROVABLY DOES NOT
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// IT SEES two spellings, because in this tree both are load-bearing and a lint
// that caught only one would under-report by more than half:
//
//   1 SHELL FORM -- `gh pr view`, `gh pr list`, `gh pr checks`, `gh run view`
//     as written in a `run:` block, a `.sh`, or a template literal.
//   2 ARGV FORM -- `spawnSync("gh", ["pr", "view", ...])`. This is the
//     DOMINANT form in `src/Core.TypeScript`, and it never contains the
//     substring `gh pr view` at all. A first draft that grepped only for the
//     shell form would have reported a fraction of the real sites and looked
//     thorough doing it.
//
// IT DOES NOT SEE:
//   * A raw `gh api graphql -f query=...` call. That is a deliberate,
//     legible choice to use GraphQL, and this lint's subject is the
//     ACCIDENTAL spend -- the call whose transport the author never picked.
//     Flagging the explicit form and not the implicit one would have the
//     polarity exactly backwards.
//   * Octokit/`@octokit/graphql` or any HTTP client reaching the GraphQL
//     endpoint directly. Not present in this tree at the time of writing;
//     named here so a later reader knows it was considered, not missed.
//   * A verb assembled at runtime: `["pr", verb]`, `gh pr "$SUB"`. The
//     transport is then undecidable statically.
//   * Any language other than the extensions in SCANNED_EXTENSIONS.
//
// A file it cannot read is a FINDING (`unreadable`), never a silent skip, and
// a scan below `--min-files` is a FINDING (`scan-floor`). Both are "the check
// did not run", and neither is allowed to look like a pass.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// COMMENTS ARE MASKED, AND THAT IS NOT A CONVENIENCE
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// This very file names all four commands, in prose, repeatedly. So does
// `.github/workflows/agent-heartbeat.yml`, which carries five comment lines
// explaining why it uses REST -- and four real call sites. A lint that
// reported its own documentation would be deleted within a day, and the first
// casualty would be the explanations that keep the discipline legible.
//
// So comments are masked before matching; STRINGS ARE NOT. The argv form lives
// entirely inside string literals, so masking string interiors would blind the
// lint to its main quarry. The masking is deliberately one-directional.
//
// Its stated limits: a `//` inside a string is treated as a comment unless it
// is preceded by `:` (the `https://` case), and in shell/YAML a `#` inside a
// quoted string is recognised only through a per-LINE quote scan, so a `#`
// inside a multi-line quoted string is masked. Both directions of that error
// under-report. They are named rather than discovered.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHAT IT MEASURED, AND WHY THERE IS A BASELINE
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// FIRST RUN, 2026-08-26, over `src/Core.TypeScript`, `.github/workflows`,
// `tools` and `.claude`: **2505 files scanned, 39 call sites in 19 files**.
// By spelling: 34 argv-form, 5 shell-form. By route: `pr list` 26, `pr view`
// 10, `pr checks` 3, `gh run view` 0. By surface: 34 TypeScript, 4
// `agent-heartbeat.yml`, 1 shell script.
//
// Three of those numbers decide the design. THE ARGV FORM IS 34 OF 39, so a
// lint built from the obvious `grep "gh pr view"` would have found five sites,
// reported a nearly-clean tree, and looked thorough doing it. `pr list` IS 26
// OF 39, and it is the expensive route -- a list costs GraphQL points in
// proportion to the pages it walks, which is how a poll loop reaches 0/5000
// inside a minute. And `gh run view` IS ZERO: named in the brief that
// commissioned this lint, present nowhere in the tree, kept in the roster
// anyway because the next agent to want a run's status will reach for it.
//
// An honest note on how this number moved, because the first draft's was
// wrong in the direction that flatters a tool. It reported 77, and 19 of those
// were ERROR AND USAGE STRINGS in TypeScript -- `"...: gh pr list failed\n"`.
// See the narrowing note in `analyzeSource`. A lint's first number is a
// hypothesis; this one had a control run against it before it was written down.
//
// Those 39 are FROZEN, not fixed. The point of the baseline is the one
// AUDIT-LIFECYCLE.md step 5 makes: a gate that demands a 19-file migration
// before it can land is a gate that never lands. Migrating them is real work
// with real behaviour change (pagination, field names, `--jq` rewrites) and it
// is not this change's job.
//
// THE BASELINE STORES COUNTS, NOT A SET, and the reason is a hole a set would
// leave. The signature is line-free -- `pr list@argv` -- so an unrelated edit
// above a row does not thaw it. But several files hold more than one call site
// of the SAME route, so a set-shaped baseline would grandfather that file's
// whole route and let a SEVENTH `gh pr list` land in `github-adapter.ts`
// silently. Counting closes it: `{ "<key>": <n> }`, and the (n+1)th is a
// finding.
//
// Its honest limit, stated rather than discovered: delete one baselined call
// and add another of the same route in the same file, and the count is
// unchanged, so the new one is not caught. Catching that needs the call's
// surrounding text in the key, and `["pr", "list"]` is byte-identical at every
// site, so there is no such text to key on. Named here as the known gap.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// SUPPRESSION
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// `graphql-transport-ok: <reason>` in a comment on the finding's line or the
// line immediately above it. The reason is mandatory and non-empty: an escape
// hatch with no stated reason is an allowlist, and an allowlist drifts. An
// empty one is itself a finding (`empty-suppression`).
//
// Everything above main() is pure over strings, so the audit is testable with
// no filesystem and its own refusals are falsifiable.

/**
 * The `gh` subcommand+verb pairs that go over GraphQL, and the REST call that
 * answers the same question.
 *
 * The remedy is carried in the data, not written into a generic message,
 * because a refusal that does not name the replacement is a refusal people
 * route around. Every entry was checked against `gh api` on this repo.
 *
 * ── AND ONE OF THEM WAS NOT EQUIVALENT ───────────────────────────────────────
 * Re-measured 2026-09-03 against this repo's live API, because "checked" is a claim with a shelf
 * life and this file's whole value is that a reader can follow its advice without thinking:
 *
 *   GET /pulls?state=open&per_page=1   ->  mergeable_state ABSENT, mergeable ABSENT
 *   GET /pulls/{number}                ->  mergeable_state "unknown", mergeable null
 *
 * So the `pr list` remedy, followed literally, DROPS `mergeStateStatus`. That is not hypothetical:
 * `observe/world-infra.ts` calls `gh pr list --json number,title,mergeStateStatus` and derives its
 * CLEAN set from that field. A caller who took the one-line fix would get `mergeState: ""` for every
 * PR and a clean-set computed from an empty string — the silent-wrong-answer class, arriving through
 * the remediation text of a lint that exists to prevent silent failures.
 *
 * The entry now names the per-PR follow-up. The trade is still right — REST is the uncontended
 * budget, so N+1 there beats one call on the contended one — but it has to be stated, because a
 * one-liner reads as a drop-in replacement and this one is not.
