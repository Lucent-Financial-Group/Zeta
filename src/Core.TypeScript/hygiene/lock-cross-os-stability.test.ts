// lock-cross-os-stability.test.ts — the falsifiers for the cross-platform lock comparison.
//
// The failure this file is weighted against is a comparison that cannot fail. A lane whose
// classifier answers "declared" to everything would report a green cross-OS measurement for
// a tree that resolves differently on every runner, and the whole point of the lane is that
// the answer is trusted enough to widen `--locked-mode` on. So the cases below are mostly
// about the DECLARED path refusing to absorb things it should not:
//
//   * a perturbed lock (the control) must come out `differs-unexplained`
//   * a RID-shaped difference in a project that declares no RID must NOT be declared
//   * a declared project with a NON-RID-shaped difference must NOT be declared
//   * a commented-out RuntimeIdentifier must not count as declaring one
//   * a lock missing on one platform must not be silently skipped
