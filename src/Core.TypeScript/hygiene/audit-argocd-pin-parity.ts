//
// -- THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES, AND IT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED ONCE ---------------
// 2026-09-03, measured on run 33736439359 and written up at length in
// `dev-cluster/use-cases.ts`: the k3s bootstrap moved 7.7.10 -> 10.6.0 on 2026-09-01
// and "this kind-lane pin was the one left behind". ArgoCD v2.13.2 ships Helm 3 only;
// seaweedfs >= 4.33.0 uses the Helm-4-only `fromToml`; the repo-server failed manifest
// generation and CACHED the error per revision, so the wave -90 self-upgrade arrived
// after the failure was already cached and could not clear it. seaweedfs then reported
// health=Healthy VACUOUSLY with zero applied resources, kube-dns answered `no such host`
// 700 times, and every mimir module died on its sanity-check.
//
// The response to that incident was PROSE. Four files now carry a paragraph saying
// "All FOUR pin sites move together". Prose is what was already there when the pin was
// left behind, so it is not what stops the next one.
//
// -- AND THE PROSE WAS ALREADY WRONG WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN --------------------
// There are FIVE sites, not four. `infra/k8s/bootstrap/argocd-install.yaml` — the
// HelmChart K3S auto-applies on NixOS first boot, i.e. the METAL bring-up path — was
// never in the roster and sat at 7.7.10 through all three bumps (09-01, 09-03, 09-04).
// Its own header still claimed "It is also the pin `full-ai-cluster` uses", which was
// true when written on 2026-08-18 and false from 2026-09-01.
//
// The consequence on metal is the incident above, on real hardware and one major
// version wider: K3S installs v2.13.2 (Helm 3), then the root Application it applies
// carries argo-cd 10.8.0 (v3.5.2, Helm 4), so ArgoCD attempts to upgrade itself across
// a major version in the earliest sync wave.
//
// -- WHAT THIS CHECKS -------------------------------------------------------
//   1. All five sites parse and yield a version.
//   2. All five are byte-equal.
//   3. The dev-cluster file yields EXACTLY TWO pins. A sixth install site appearing
//      there fails rather than being silently unchecked — the roster is the thing that
//      drifted last time, so a check that quietly audits fewer sites than exist would
//      reproduce the defect it is here to catch.
//
// It is a TEXT check: offline, no `helm`, no cluster, no network. What it cannot say is
// whether a version RESOLVES upstream (`audit-chart-target-revisions.ts`) or whether the
// values survive the bump (`helm template`, done by hand at bump time and recorded in the
// file headers). Three different questions; none replaces the others.

/**
 * THE ADOPTION IS A NO-OP, OR IT IS NOT AN ADOPTION.
 *
 * -- WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A KEY-PRESENCE CHECK ------------------
 * `Application.yaml` has stated an invariant in prose since it was written: "Mirror the
 * bootstrap values so adopting this Application is a no-op transition." MEASURED
 * 2026-09-25 by rendering both value sets at the pinned argo-cd 10.8.0, that was FALSE --
 * the bootstrap rendered 6 workloads and the Application 7. Four keys the bootstrap set
 * were simply absent here (`dex.enabled`, `redis-ha.enabled`, `controller.replicas`,
 * `repoServer.replicas`), so adoption at sync-wave -90 did not adopt: it turned dex back
 * on and added a Deployment plus its image pull, in the EARLIEST wave, on the most
 * contended node state a fresh install ever has.
 *
 * This file's own header already says why prose did not stop it: "The response to that
 * incident was PROSE. Prose is what was already there when the pin was left behind, so it
 * is not what stops the next one." The dex drift is that sentence coming true a second
 * time, on the same pair of files.
 *
 * A check for "does the Application set dex.enabled" would have caught THAT drift and
 * nothing else. Every key here was individually fine; the SET of them was wrong. So the
 * assertion is on the whole value map, which is the only shape that catches the next
 * missing key without knowing its name in advance.
 *
 * -- WHY EQUALITY RATHER THAN A RENDER ----------------------------------------
 * Render equivalence is the property actually wanted. Value-set equality is STRICTLY
 * STRONGER for one chart at one pinned version -- equal inputs to a deterministic
 * template cannot produce different outputs -- and it needs no `helm`, no network and no
 * cluster, which keeps this auditor in the offline class its header promises. A gate that
 * needs the network is a gate that can be unavailable, and an unavailable gate reads like
 * a passing one.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT: equality says the two files agree, never that the chart READS what they
 * agree on. `inert-valuesobject-keys.ts` owns that half and earned it here -- it caught
 * `applicationSet.enabled` being a dead key at 10.8.0 the moment this parity was
 * repaired. The two checks compose and neither substitutes for the other.
