// audit-single-file-rewrite-churn.ts -- unbounded growth is permitted only with a stated
// scaling and cost model. Without one it is unfounded, and it will fall over eventually.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
// --------------------
// Aaron 2026-09-11, the observation that started it:
//
//   "any time a single file is getting written over and over and over on some cadence
//    that's a huge smell on github where history is forever"
//
// and the shape to prefer:
//
//   "one per event would be best, and they can be in dated folders so we don't end up with
//    too many files in one folder"
//
// Then, widening it, which is why this file's subject is bigger than its name:
//
//   "basically we are trying to track bounded vs unbounded growth per file / folder, and for
//    anything that is unbounded forever that's a huge smell. most things don't need to be
//    kept forever but this is the default of git."
//
//   "anything that is unbounded history, we need a scaling and cost model, or else it's
//    unfounded and will fall over eventually."
//
// A rewritten file is the SYMPTOM this check was commissioned for. The subject is BOUNDED vs
// UNBOUNDED growth, per file AND per directory, and the demand on the unbounded ones is a
// declared model. GIT'S DEFAULT IS UNBOUNDED, which is the whole reason this needs saying:
// "we never thought about it" and "we chose to keep it forever" produce byte-identical
// repositories.
//
// ============================================================================================
// THIS IS AN OPTIMIZATION, NOT A MORAL POSITION -- READ THE WHOLE FILE THAT WAY
// ============================================================================================
// Aaron 2026-09-11, and this frames everything below it:
//
//   "this is an optimization technique. in a perfect world it would be free to store all
//    history, or recalculate it forever. our generator functions over history are trying to
//    compress history like columnar storage but over TIME rather than SPACE -- but even this
//    reaches its limits. some change rates, i'd argue most, require windows only. few are
//    worth storing all bytes for history forever, unless it can't be compressed with high
//    accuracy."
//
// NOTHING HERE IS "WASTE IS BAD". In a perfect world you keep everything. Storage costs and
// recomputation costs are BOTH real, and this register is a record of WHERE WE CHOSE TO PAY.
// A register that reads as disapproval gets argued with; one that reads as a cost decision
// gets used. If a row here feels like an accusation, the row is worded wrong.
//
// The columnar analogy is exact and worth keeping verbatim: columnar storage compresses by
// exploiting similarity WITHIN A COLUMN; a generator over history compresses by exploiting
// similarity ACROSS TIME. Same technique, different axis.
//
// ============================================================================================
// THE DECISION PROCEDURE -- THREE STEPS, IN ORDER
// ============================================================================================
// Aaron 2026-09-11:
//
//   "anything we can come up with a rolling window that is roughly the same cost, that can all
//    stay fast. anything that is genuinely unbounded, we have to spread out over speed/cost
//    based on access methods, and the default being older data is accessed less."
//
//   STEP 1. ROLLING WINDOW AT ROUGHLY CONSTANT COST?
//           If yes -- bound it and stop. Constant cost is the thing tiering was trying to buy.
//           (But see the next section: in git a window bounds the TIP, not the HISTORY.)
//
//   STEP 2. REGENERABLE FROM A GENERATOR AT SUFFICIENT FIDELITY?
//           If yes -- KEEP THE GENERATOR, and window or drop the bytes. THE GENERATOR IS THE
//           COMPRESSION. This is the DBSP / Z-set move the whole repo is built on: the delta
//           stream plus the fold IS the compressed history.
//
//   STEP 3. NEITHER?
//           Genuinely unbounded and incompressible. Tier it BY ACCESS PATTERN -- with AGE AS
//           THE DEFAULT PROXY for access, older accessed less UNLESS MEASURED OTHERWISE -- and
//           price it with the five model fields below.
//
// TIERING IS THE LAST RESORT, NOT THE GOAL. A register that assigns tiers to things that could
// have been bounded, or regenerated, has solved the wrong problem more expensively.
//
//   >> CALIBRATION, AND IT IS A CHECK ON THIS REGISTER'S OWN OUTPUT: STEP 3 SHOULD BE RARE. <<
//
// Aaron's claim is that MOST change rates need windows only, and FEW deserve all bytes forever.
// So if this register fills with step-3 rows, the likeliest explanation is that GENERATORS WERE
// NOT LOOKED FOR -- not that the data is special. Read a long step-3 list as a finding about
// the reviewers, not about the repository. The audit prints that count on every run for exactly
// this reason.
//
// ============================================================================================
// THE SUBTLETY THAT MAKES STEP 1 INCOMPLETE INSIDE GIT
// ============================================================================================
//
//   >> A ROLLING WINDOW BOUNDS THE TIP. IT DOES NOT BOUND THE HISTORY.
//      IN GIT THOSE ARE DIFFERENT THINGS. <<
//
// `data/tick-latest.json` is the proof, measured here 2026-09-11: **251 bytes at tip** -- a
// window of size one, perfectly bounded -- and **1091 versions**. Bounded at tip, unbounded in
// history. Rewriting a small file forever is not a bounded design in a substrate that keeps
// every version; it is an unbounded one wearing a small file's clothes, and it is the worst
// shape for delta compression because each write REPLACES rather than appends.
//
//   rolling window + a FORGETTING substrate  ->  constant cost, stays fast     OK
//   rolling window + git                     ->  STILL UNBOUNDED IN HISTORY    tick-latest.json
//
// So inside git, "make it a rolling window" is NOT a complete answer. It must be paired with
// either a colder tier or a substrate that drops old versions -- which is exactly the gap
// `zetadb`/`zetafs` bounded history is meant to close. That is the difference between a fix
// and a fix-shaped gesture, and it is why every row here carries TIP and HISTORY as SEPARATE
// verdicts rather than one.
//
// The two paths that motivated this check are both unbounded-in-history for DIFFERENT reasons
// and want DIFFERENT answers, which is the clearest argument for the split columns:
//
//   data/tick-latest.json                      251 B at tip, 1091 versions
//       -> wants a forgetting substrate, or a colder tier. Retiring it is not the question.
//   docs/hygiene-history/loop-tick-history.md  648 KB at tip, 86 versions, dead 3 months
//       -> wanted retirement, and got it: frozen 2026-04-30, kept because 191 of its 212 rows
//          exist nowhere else (measured; see its own header).
//
// ============================================================================================
// THE ORGANISING FRAME -- DV2.0 WITH RECURSIVE SATELLITES; DEPTH *IS* THE TIER
// ============================================================================================
// Aaron 2026-09-11:
//
//   "yes this comes back to data vault 2.0, but with a twist where sats can have sats can have
//    sats etc... each one is slower than the next."
//
// DV2.0 as already carved in `.claude/rules/dv2-data-split-discipline-activated.md` partitions
// substrate by CHANGE RATE: hubs (stable keys), links (relationships), satellites
// (fast-changing attributes). The twist is that a satellite can itself have satellites, and
// each level down is COLDER AND SLOWER than the one above. The storage hierarchy is not a
// second mechanism bolted on; it IS DV2.0 applied recursively, so
//
//   >> DEPTH IN THE SATELLITE CHAIN IS THE TIER. <<
//
// which makes the `satelliteChain` field DERIVABLE rather than a number somebody picked.
//
// THIS IS NOT A NEW DEMAND ON ANYONE. DV2.0 is one of the seven always-active disciplines, and
// manifesto §9 (recursive -- same rules at every scale) and §10 (self-similar -- shape stays
// recognisable at every magnification) already require exactly this shape. A reviewer who
// accepts DV2.0 has already accepted this. Cite those, not first principles.
//
// AND THE REPO HAS BEEN BUILDING RECURSIVE SATELLITES FOR MONTHS WITHOUT NAMING THE RECURSION:
//
//   memory/MEMORY.md (hub, ~1.5 KB target, always loaded)
//       -> INDEX.md (satellite)
//       -> ~897 topic files (satellites of the satellite)                        3 levels
//
//   docs/SEED-VOCABULARY.md (cold-boot kernel)
//       -> docs/GLOSSARY.md (~13.6k tokens, on demand)
//       -> docs/research/* (satellite of the satellite)                          3 levels
//
//   .claude/rules/ (resident)
//       -> .claude/rules.bak/ (archived; the #6676 sweep was an explicit
//          cold-start-token reduction)
//       -> the docs each carved sentence points at                               3 levels
//
//   docs/github/prs/shards/ (key + metadata, small, bucketed)
//       -> docs/history/pr-reviews/ (the record, ~1.5 KB on disk each)
//       -> [ NOT BUILT: the full diff/comment payload, which is the thing that
//            should live coldest ]                                               2 of 3
//
// THE REPO TIERS ATTENTION RIGOROUSLY AND HAS NEVER TIERED STORAGE. Naming that asymmetry is
// this file's contribution: it makes the storage rule an EXTENSION of a discipline already
// accepted here rather than a new ask.
//
// WHERE NO CHAIN EXISTS, THE ABSENCE IS THE FINDING. An unbounded path with no satellite
// structure has NOWHERE TO DEMOTE TO, which is a sharper statement of "unfounded" than the
// word itself.
//
// HONEST CAVEAT ON THE MAPPING, because it is a proxy and not an identity: DV2.0 partitions by
// CHANGE rate; the tiering argument is about ACCESS rate. They correlate -- hot data tends to
// change and be read, cold data neither -- but they come apart: a rarely-changing config read
// on every boot is a slow-changing satellite that must stay HOT. So DEPTH IS THE DEFAULT PROXY
// FOR TIER exactly as AGE IS THE DEFAULT PROXY FOR ACCESS, and measured access beats both.
//
// ============================================================================================
// GIT IS AN EXPENSIVE HOT TIER BEING USED FOR COLD DATA
// ============================================================================================
// Aaron 2026-09-11:
//
//   "most things that need to be kept forever we need to think of like L1, L2, L3 cache,
//    L4 memory, L5 hdd/ssd, L6 distributed db, L7 s3-like storage, etc. this is not exact at
//    all, just an example of older = slower/cheaper storage. anything unbounded we need to
//    think of like this for economic reasons."
//
// The ladder is illustrative and he says so; the load-bearing half is OLDER = SLOWER AND
// CHEAPER. Something must get colder with age, because that is what makes "keep it forever"
// economically survivable.
//
// Every clone pays for every byte of history, on every machine, forever. Putting a
// 14,379-file archive corpus in git is putting archival data in the MOST-REPLICATED TIER
// AVAILABLE. That is the economic error -- not the file count. It also explains why splitting
// into multiple repos is a TIERING move rather than a tidying one (a separate repo is a colder
// tier, cloned only by whoever needs it), and why "some files can be overwritten without
// saving history" is demotion to a tier with no history at all.
//
// ============================================================================================
// THE TEST -- REGENERABLE? THE GENERATOR *IS* THE COMPRESSION
// ============================================================================================
//
//   >> Can this history be REGENERATED from a generator at acceptable fidelity?
//      If YES, keep the generator and window the bytes -- the generator IS the compression.
//      If NO, the bytes ARE the information, and that is what earns keeping them. <<
//
// This replaces an earlier phrasing of the same idea ("does this history answer a question
// nothing else can"), which was a judgement call where this is mechanical.
//
// IT IS ALREADY CARVED HERE. `.claude/rules/only-the-irreducible-is-primitive-generate-the-
// rest.md`: THE GENERATOR IS THE ERROR-CORRECTING CODE -- generation and correction are dual,
// and regenerating from the irreducible IS the correction. `derive-pr-manifest.ts` says the
// same thing in its own header: "regenerating must reproduce the checked-in content, so the
// generator IS the error-correcting code."
//
// THE WORKED EXAMPLE, AND IT IS THE ONE THAT MOTIVATED THIS CHECK. `docs/github/prs/
// manifest.jsonl` was fully derivable from the shard ledger, so its 433 committed versions
// were pure cost carrying no information. That is precisely why retiring it in PR #17279 lost
// nothing -- and why KEEPING `derive-pr-manifest.ts` was the right half to keep. Deleting the
// bytes and deleting the generator are completely different acts; only the first was done.
//
// FIDELITY IS A FIELD, NOT A YES/NO. Aaron says "high accuracy", not "exact", and the
// difference is load-bearing: a generator reproducing 99% of a telemetry series is fine for
// telemetry and unacceptable for a dependency lock. So a row records WHAT FIDELITY THE
// GENERATOR ACHIEVES (`generator`) and WHAT FIDELITY THE PURPOSE NEEDS (`fidelityNeeded`), and
// THE GAP BETWEEN THEM IS THE ARGUMENT FOR KEEPING BYTES. A row whose two fidelity fields match
// is a row whose bytes are not earning their keep.
//
// AND THE LIMIT, WHICH IS AARON'S OWN AND BELONGS IN THE SAME ROW RATHER THAN IN A FOOTNOTE:
// "even this reaches its limits." Generator-compression is NOT free. The generator must be
// KEPT, RUN, and VERIFIED, and A GENERATOR NOBODY RUNS IS A CHECK THAT DID NOT RUN WEARING A
// COMPRESSION ALGORITHM'S CLOTHES. `manifest.jsonl` is the proof of that too: its deriver was
// paused with the 2026-08-29 cadence batch, the file rotted, and the gate that would have said
// so was paused alongside it. So the `generator` field must name the generator's upkeep cost,
// not merely its existence.
//
// AND THE LOCK CASE IS NOT MERELY PERMITTED -- IT IS REQUIRED BY A CARVED RULE.
// `.claude/rules/clone-at-tag-stays-sufficient.md` demands the repo stay buildable and
// checkable from `git clone` at a pinned tag WITH NO PACKAGE MANAGER PRESENT. That is only
// true if the dependency closure is committed AT THAT TAG. Stripping a lock file's versioned
// history would break a rule this repo already holds. Cite that rule, not taste, when a lock
// row is questioned. It is also the one row with NO `liftsWhen` -- and it still needs a cost
// model. "Its history is the product" justifies keeping it; it does not exempt it from being
// priced.
//
// ============================================================================================
// A SCALING AND COST MODEL: FIVE FIELDS, NOT PROSE
// ============================================================================================
// Every row whose HISTORY is unbounded must state:
//
//   1. rate            -- growth per day or per event, MEASURED, not estimated.
//   2. costPerUnit     -- bytes and/or files per unit of growth. Use `--cost`.
//   3. breaksFirst     -- what fails first, and roughly when: clone time, a directory listing,
//                         a tree walk, a lint scan.
//   4. generator       -- STEP 2. The generator that can reproduce this history and the FIDELITY
//                         it achieves, PLUS the generator's own upkeep cost (kept, run,
//                         verified). `none -- <why>` is legal and marks the row STEP 3.
//   5. fidelityNeeded  -- what fidelity this data's PURPOSE requires. The gap between this and
//                         `generator` is the argument for keeping bytes; no gap means the bytes
//                         are not earning their keep.
//   6. satelliteChain  -- the DV2.0 chain this path sits in, and at what depth. This is the
//                         tier. "none --" is a legal and very loud answer.
//   7. demotionPlan    -- what moves colder, at what age, and what stays hot.
//
// A row that cannot state them is NOT exempt. It is UNFOUNDED, and that is the finding. Write
// `UNKNOWN -- <what you tried>` and the register reports it, loudly, on every run. "I do not
// know the growth rate" IS the report, and it is worth more than a confident guess.
//
// ============================================================================================
// CANONICAL ORDERING -- WHAT MAKES A LEGITIMATE EXCEPTION AFFORDABLE
// ============================================================================================
// Aaron 2026-09-11:
//
//   "our canonical ordering should have a sort algo attached, or else be first-in-wins.
//    first-in-wins should also try to have a stable sort order too."
//
// Generalised: AN ACCUMULATING FILE MUST DECLARE ITS ORDER. Two legitimate declarations, no
// third:
//
//   1. A NAMED COMPARATOR -- the file states which sort produces it, and regenerating with that
//      comparator reproduces the bytes.
//   2. FIRST-IN-WINS (insertion order) -- append-only, nothing reordered on write.
//
// And the half people skip: FIRST-IN-WINS IS ONLY STABLE IF ITS INPUT SEQUENCE IS. Insertion
// order inherits the determinism of whatever produced the insertions. A parallel fan-out, a
// `readdir()`, or `Object.keys()` iteration gives a different order per run or per machine, so
// a file that LOOKS append-only still produces a near-full-blob diff.
//
// AN UNDECLARED ORDER IS THE ACTUAL DEFECT, because it varies silently by runtime. Same
// failure `.claude/rules/culture-invariant-by-default.md` already names for strings -- a sort
// that varies by locale -- one level up, applied to file generation.
//
// THE REPO SOLVED THIS THREE TIMES AD HOC AND NEVER NAMED THE RULE. Naming it once, here, is
// the point. DO NOT BUILD A FOURTH SORTING LINT:
//
//   - `src/Core.TypeScript/ace/build-graph.ts` -- the ace dependency graph, the very file named
//     as the legitimate exception, already sorts with `ordinalCompare` at five sites. The
//     exception already complies: it is affordable BECAUSE it is canonically ordered.
//   - `src/Core.TypeScript/hygiene/sort-tick-history-canonical.ts` +
//     `check-tick-history-order.ts` -- `data/tick-history.json`, the worst churn offender
//     measured, is already canonically ordered AND checked.
//   - `src/Core.TypeScript/hygiene/lint-no-culture-sensitive-collation.ts` -- the
//     `localeCompare` class.
//
// CANONICAL ORDERING DOES NOT REDUCE REWRITE COUNT. IT REDUCES THE SIZE OF EACH REWRITE. And
// the effect is enormous -- measured here 2026-09-11, on-disk sum over every distinct blob a
// path has ever had, against the sum of the same blobs' uncompressed sizes:
//
//   path                                   versions   raw       ON-DISK   ratio   per version
//   data/tick-history.json  (sorted appends)   1090   198.5 MB   241 KB    805x       226 B
//   docs/BACKLOG.md         (sorted, derived)   796   152.4 MB   966 KB    154x      1.24 KB
//   ace/build-graph.json    (ordinalCompare)     48     4.0 MB    27 KB    144x       583 B
//   memory/MEMORY.md        (hand-edited)       694   150.2 MB  1.06 MB    138x      1.57 KB
//   bun.lock                                     26     2.0 MB    72 KB     27x      2.80 KB
//   data/tick-latest.json   (full replace)     1089   264.0 KB    50 KB      5x        47 B
//
// 805x for canonically ordered appends against 27x for bun.lock is the whole argument, in one
// table. It also shows why COUNT ALONE MISLEADS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS: tick-history.json has the
// most versions in the repo and costs 241 KB, while bun.lock has 26 versions and costs 72 KB.
//
// AND A NOTE AGAINST DRAMATISING tick-latest.json: 1091 versions of a 251-byte pointer cost
// about 50 KB on disk in total. It is CHEAP IN BYTES and still the canonical wrong shape --
// because 1091 versions of a pointer answer no question, and because the pattern scales badly
// the moment the pointer stops being 251 bytes. The sin is the shape, not the bill. Saying
// otherwise here would be the same overstatement this file spends a section warning about.
//
// ============================================================================================
// IN-TREE PRIOR ART FOR A RETENTION POLICY -- SHAPE, NOT COVERAGE
// ============================================================================================
// `src/Core/SoftEmu.fs` carries `SoftPrunePolicy` / `SoftPruneFeedback` / `SoftPruneReport`: a
// bounded-growth policy with a TYPED choice between `NoForgetBackpressure` (refuse to exceed
// the budget, return typed backpressure, leave the caller's state untouched) and
// `KeepHighestWeight` (lossy by design, but EMITS THE DROPPED TAIL so the forgetting is loud).
// It bounds an ensemble width, not file history, so it is not reusable here -- but it is
// exactly the shape a retention policy should take, and it is in-tree rather than a proposal.
//
// `src/Core/ZetaFsPolicy.fs` carries the file-shaped version:
// `HistoryPolicy.Rolling of maxVersions * maxPhaseSpan * maxBytes`, volume default
// `maxVersions = 32`, decided in `ZetaFsFreeze.fs`, collected by the budgeted reclaim ferry in
// `ZetaFsReclaim.fs`. Its own source notes the caps are "named and unmetered" beyond
// `maxVersions`. `src/Core.TypeScript/zetadb/retention-policy.ts` carries the event-log version
// (event-count and checkpoint-byte limits, with `displacedEventIds` receipts so displacement is
// observable rather than silent).
//
// BOUNDED HISTORY FOR THIS REPO'S OWN FILES IS A DESIGN GOAL, NOT ENFORCED. Those mechanisms
// bound ZetaFs volumes and ZetaDb journals. NOTHING bounds a path in THIS git repository, and
// this check does not change that. Do not read the citations as coverage.
//
// ============================================================================================
// EVERY ROW CARRIES A `liftsWhen`, AND IT IS MANDATORY IN BOTH DIRECTIONS
// ============================================================================================
// Either an exit condition, or an explicit `none -- <why>`. Which one it is must be obvious at
// a glance, because two rows with the same shape and different permanence is exactly how an
// allowlist stops meaning anything. A row that says "forced, permanently" with no reasoning is
// where an exemption goes to die quietly, and where the next person learns that arguing is
// enough. A row that names its exit stays a DEBT somebody can check.
//
// ============================================================================================
// HOW THE COUNT IS TAKEN, AND WHY IT DISAGREES WITH HAND MEASUREMENTS
// ============================================================================================
// Counts come from ONE `git log --name-only HEAD` walk. No network. No refs beyond the commit
// graph reachable from the checked-out tip, so the verdict is a function of the repository.
//
// NOT `--all`, deliberately: `git log --all` includes whatever refs THIS CLONE happens to have
// fetched, so its answer differs per machine. Measured 2026-09-11, the gap is large and uneven:
//
//   docs/hygiene-history/loop-tick-history.md   HEAD  86   --all  703
//   memory/MEMORY.md                            HEAD 696   --all  941
//   docs/BACKLOG.md                             HEAD 800   --all 1227
//   src/Core.TypeScript/ace/build-graph.json    HEAD  49   --all   62
//
// So numbers quoted from `--all` elsewhere will not match this check, and this check is the
// reproducible one. `--follow` was also measured and changed nothing on these paths.
//
// ============================================================================================
// THE HONEST LIMITS -- ALL FIVE
// ============================================================================================
// 1. COUNT IS A PROXY FOR COST, AND A BAD ONE. See the 805x-vs-27x table above: an append-mostly
//    file delta-compresses beautifully, a full-rewrite snapshot does not. Count overstates some
//    paths and understates others. Use `--cost` when the number matters.
//
// 2. COUNT ANSWERS "HOW OFTEN", SIZE ANSWERS "HOW MUCH", AND NEITHER ANSWERS WHETHER IT IS
//    BOUNDED. Boundedness is a property of the WRITER, and no amount of history inspection
//    reveals it. This check measures growth and demands a declared model; it CANNOT verify
//    that a claimed bound is real.
//
// 3. IT CANNOT VERIFY A DEMOTION PLAN EITHER. It checks that `satelliteChain` and
//    `demotionPlan` are present and non-empty. Whether demotion HAPPENS is a property of a
//    process running elsewhere, and a declared plan nobody executes is precisely the shape this
//    repo calls a check that did not run. Prefer a `liftsWhen` naming the mechanism that would
//    make demotion OBSERVABLE over an unverifiable promise.
//
// 4. `--cost` MEASURES THIS CLONE'S PACKING. `%(objectsize:disk)` reflects how git happened to
//    pack these objects here; `git gc --aggressive` changes it. It measures a repository
//    instance, not a repository invariant. It is still the right number -- see limit 5.
//
// 5. NEVER QUOTE AN UNCOMPRESSED BLOB-SUM AS REPO SIZE. It was nearly done here once. The RAW
//    column above overstates by 5x to 805x depending on the path. Summing `%(objectsize)` over
//    a path's history is not repo growth and quoting it as such misleads by up to three orders
//    of magnitude.
//
// ============================================================================================
// WHAT FAILS, AND WHAT ONLY REPORTS
// ============================================================================================
// FAILS (exit 1):
//   - a register row whose measured value EXCEEDS its `ceiling` -- the ratchet;
//   - a malformed row (missing field, short reason, bad `ceiling`);
//   - a liveness floor breach. An empty walk is not a pass.
//
// REPORTS (exit 0):
//   - hot paths absent from the register, ranked. Findings, not verdicts. Several belong to
//     cadence lanes deliberately paused 2026-08-29 pending a redesign gated on hardware, and
//     redesigning those lanes is not this check's business.
//   - BOUNDED-AT-TIP, UNBOUNDED-IN-HISTORY rows -- the `tick-latest.json` class. A rolling
//     window that git still keeps every version of.
//   - UNFOUNDED rows -- history unbounded, model absent. Permitted to exist, visible every run.
//     This category BEING VISIBLE is the point.
//   - RETIRED rows -- a row naming a path that no longer exists. Retirement is the desired end
//     state, so failing on it would punish the success. Delete the row.
//   - OVER-PROVISIONED ceilings -- constraining nothing.
//
// DRIFT TIER. NOT wired into `gate (required)`: a live surface like `memory/MEMORY.md` would
// trip the ratchet on an ordinary day's work, and a check that blocks main for doing the
// expected thing gets disabled rather than obeyed.
