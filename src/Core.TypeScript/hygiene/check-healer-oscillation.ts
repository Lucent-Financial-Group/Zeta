/**
 * check-healer-oscillation.ts — run the oscillation registry over the Tier-0 healers in CI.
 *
 * WHY. `oscillation-registry.ts` landed with 17 falsifiers and zero callers. A tested module
 * nobody runs proves its own properties and constrains nothing — the same shape as a check that
 * cannot fail, and the fourth instance of it I have shipped in a day. This is the caller.
 *
 * WHAT THE HARNESS ALREADY COVERS, so this does not duplicate it. `healer-harness.ts` certifies
 * idempotence, closure and convergence of the COMPOSITE, in the one order `composeHealers` folds.
 * That establishes the composite reaches *a* fixed point. It never establishes it reaches *the*
 * fixed point — so the hardcoded order in `run-tier0.ts` can be silently load-bearing. Five
 * healers admit 120 orders and exactly one is certified.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ADDS. The pairwise relation, and only the two genuinely-defective ones fail:
 *
 *   disjoint / commutes  -> fine. Order cannot matter, or demonstrably does not.
 *   override             -> order IS load-bearing. Legal, but only once declared with a reason.
 *   oscillate            -> the composite never settles. Always a defect; no declaration excuses it.
 *
 * THE VACUITY GUARD IS THE REASON THIS IS SAFE TO GATE ON. A pair can only disagree on inputs both
 * of them touch, so a corpus that fires neither healer reports `disjoint` for everything and means
 * nothing. Measured 2026-08-27: the three BUILT-IN harness fixtures fire NONE of the Tier-0
 * healers — a registry built from them alone would be a green check over an empty experiment. So
 * this refuses to pass on a corpus that fired nothing, and the refusal is the point.
 *
 * TODAY IT SHOULD BE ALL-DISJOINT, HEIGHT 1. That is a property of this ROSTER, not of the
 * harness: the five happen to act on `.js` siblings, workflow YAML, TS imports, TS spreads and doc
 * links. The first healer added whose write-set overlaps an existing one is where this earns its
 * keep — and the harness's own test file already proves order-dependence is reachable
 * ("composition order decides legality").
