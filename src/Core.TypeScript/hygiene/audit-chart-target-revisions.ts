// DOES EVERY ARGOCD `targetRevision` NAME A CHART VERSION UPSTREAM ACTUALLY
// PUBLISHED?
//
// -- THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR, measured on main 2026-08-20 ---------------
// `full-ai-cluster/k8s/applications/oz/Application.yaml` pins
// `ziti-controller` at `targetRevision: 1.4.5`. OpenZiti never published a
// `ziti-controller` chart at 1.4.5 -- their 1.x chart line ends at 1.3.4, and
// `1.4.2` exists in that repository only as an `appVersion`, which is the
// *application's* version and not a coordinate Helm can resolve. ArgoCD cannot
// resolve the pin, so that Application can never sync. Nothing noticed,
// because `oz` is one of 26 of the 45 Applications in this tree that no CI
// lane exercises -- so nothing ever asked the upstream repository to hand over
// that chart. (workitem 081M0JVD5YG087G0R002QDFR9H, PR #13313.)
//
// A pin that cannot resolve is the purest form of this repo's organising
// refusal: a check that did not run must never look like a check that passed.
// The manifest is syntactically perfect, `kubectl apply` accepts it, the app
// appears in ArgoCD, and the chart behind it does not exist.
//
// -- WHY THE CHECK IS OFFLINE, AND WHAT THE NETWORK HALF IS FOR ------------
// The obvious implementation resolves each pin against its upstream registry
// at check time. That check is worth roughly one week: it makes every PR in
// this repository depend on twelve third-party registries being reachable, a
// flake reddens changes that touch nothing near the cluster tree, and the step
// gets deleted by whoever is on the receiving end of that. So the work is
// split by what changes at what rate (DV2.0):
//
//   OFFLINE (this file's default mode, PR-blocking).  Every coordinate in the
//   tree is resolved against `published-chart-versions.json`, a checked-in
//   snapshot of what each upstream repository publishes. Pure, hermetic,
//   deterministic, no sockets. This is what runs in the cross-verify floor.
//
//   NETWORK (`--refresh`, scheduled, NEVER PR-blocking).  Re-fetches every
//   coordinate's published version list from its registry and rewrites the
//   snapshot. Allowed to fail loudly -- a registry being down delays a roster
//   update and blocks nobody.
//
// The snapshot is therefore evidence with a date on it, not an oracle. It says
// "as of <fetchedAt>, this repository published these versions". A pin absent
// from that list is a pin nothing upstream could hand ArgoCD at that moment.
//
// -- WHY A MISSING ROSTER ENTRY IS A FINDING, NOT A SKIP -------------------
// The tempting behaviour for a coordinate the snapshot does not cover is to
// skip it. That is the defect class this file exists for, wearing the check's
// own uniform: the unchecked pin would be indistinguishable from a checked one
// in the exit code. So an uncovered coordinate FAILS, with the refresh command
// in the message. Likewise a manifest that will not parse, a source that is
// neither a chart nor a git path, and a roster entry for a coordinate the tree
// no longer contains. Every coordinate lands in exactly one bucket and the
// buckets are printed with counts, so a pass states its own scope.
//
// -- GIT-PATH SOURCES ARE RECOGNISED, NOT IGNORED -------------------------
// Eleven Applications here source a directory out of this repository rather
// than a chart out of a registry. Those have no chart version to resolve, so
// they are classified `git-path` and counted -- explicitly, by name, in the
// output. A source carrying BOTH `chart` and `path`, or NEITHER, is a finding:
// it is a coordinate this file cannot classify, and an unclassifiable
// coordinate must never be silently absent from the total.
//
// -- WHERE THIS STOPS, said out loud --------------------------------------
// The walk is `full-ai-cluster/k8s/applications/**` and nothing else. It is
// RECURSIVE, not depth-1, so `game-hosting/gmod/Application.yaml` is audited --
// the depth-1 assumption in the argocd-health harness is precisely how that
// manifest stayed invisible while failing to sync on every reconcile (see
// cluster/app-of-apps-discovery.ts). Out of scope, deliberately and by name:
// `full-ai-cluster/k8s/bootstrap/root-application.yaml`, the app-of-apps root,
// which is a git-path source into this repository and so has no chart version
// to resolve either way. Nothing else in the tree declares an Application.
//
// -- THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT REGISTER, NOW EMPTY ------------------------------
// It held one entry, for `oz`, recorded on the day this file was written and
// retired the day after. The retirement is the register working, and the shape
// of it is worth keeping: the entry said the replacement version was "not
// mechanical" and "not drop-in for the pinned values in this manifest", and
// that turned out to be FALSE when someone measured it. `helm template` of
// 1.3.4, 2.1.2, 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 against that Application's own valuesObject
// produces the identical storage contract in all four; every key the manifest
// actually sets survives all three major lines. What was really blocking `oz`
// was a different, unrecorded defect the bad pin had been hiding -- a missing
// `clientApi.advertisedHost`, which every published version requires. So the
// acknowledgement was carrying a REASON nobody had checked, which is the failure
// mode a register is supposed to be immune to, and the register caught it in the
// end only because the pin moved and the entry went stale.
//
// The register is drift-checked in BOTH directions: an acknowledgement whose pin
// no longer exists, or whose pin has become resolvable, is itself a finding.
// That is what separates a dated acknowledgement from an allowlist -- an
// allowlist only ever grows quiet. That check is what refused this tree the
// moment the pin was corrected and the entry was left behind.
//
// Anchor (Beacon): this is dependency *resolvability* checking, the property
// `cargo`/`npm` get from a committed lockfile and Helm's `Chart.lock` gives a
// chart's own dependencies -- ArgoCD has no equivalent for an Application's
// `targetRevision`, which is why it must be audited rather than resolved.
//
// -- THE SECOND SNAPSHOT: PUBLISH DATES -----------------------------------
// `--refresh` also writes `published-chart-dates.json` (see
// chart-publish-dates.ts). Resolvability and CURRENCY are different questions
// -- a pin can resolve perfectly and be twenty-three majors behind -- and the
// currency answer needs one extra fact per version: when upstream published
// it. That fact is ALREADY in the `index.yaml` this file downloads, so it is
// recorded here rather than fetched again on a second schedule. Nothing in the
// PR-blocking path above reads it; `report-chart-currency.ts` does.
//

// fetch failed), 2 usage or IO.
