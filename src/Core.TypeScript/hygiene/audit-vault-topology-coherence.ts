// audit-vault-topology-coherence.ts -- makes the Vault ArgoCD Application's
// internal agreement a CHECKED fact instead of a comment somebody wrote.
//
// == WHY (081M0H19QD3087G0R003GV76ZY) =======================================
// The Vault Application shipped in a state where it could never come up, and
// every one of the defects was a DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN TWO FACTS THAT LIVED IN
// DIFFERENT PLACES. Nothing compared them, so nothing went red:
//
//   * `global.tlsDisable: false` (VAULT_ADDR gets an https:// scheme) versus
//     the listener HCL the chart supplies by DEFAULT, which sets
//     `tls_disable = 1`. The probe ran `vault status -tls-skip-verify`, which
//     skips certificate VERIFICATION and not the handshake, so an https
//     client hit a plaintext listener and readiness could never pass.
//   * A header comment claiming cert-manager provided TLS, versus a tree with
//     zero `kind: Certificate` resources.
//   * `replicas: 3` versus a one-node cluster, with the chart's REQUIRED
//     podAntiAffinity on kubernetes.io/hostname never mentioned in the file
//     at all -- so a reader could not tell from the manifest which topology
//     it was configured for.
//   * `storageClass: longhorn` at sync-wave -60 versus longhorn installing at
//     sync-wave -15.
//
// The TLS/scheme rule is the sharp one: it is a coherence check nothing in
// the repo performed, and its absence is exactly why this shipped.
//
// == WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO (stated, not hidden) =============================
// It reads the Application's VALUES; it does not run `helm template`. That
// keeps it offline and network-free, at the cost of ENCODING two chart
// behaviours rather than observing them:
//
//   (a) `global.tlsDisable` steers the VAULT_ADDR / VAULT_API_ADDR scheme;
//   (b) an ABSENT `server.affinity` / `injector.affinity` means the chart's
//       `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` anti-affinity on
//       topologyKey kubernetes.io/hostname is in effect.
//
// Both were measured against chart vault-0.29.1 by `helm template` on
// 2026-08-21. The audit PINS that version (rule `chart-version-unmeasured`)
// so a targetRevision bump fails until someone re-measures rather than
// silently invalidating (a) and (b).
//
// Its HCL reading is a targeted scan for `tls_disable`, `retry_join` and
// `leader_api_addr` -- not a full HCL parse.
//
// It deliberately does NOT adjudicate port 8201. Vault's cluster port always
// uses TLS with a self-signed certificate Vault generates itself and
// distributes through the encrypted barrier, so `VAULT_CLUSTER_ADDR` being
// `https://...:8201` beside a plaintext API listener is CORRECT. A naive
// "all schemes must match" check flags that wrongly, which would train
// readers to ignore the check -- the failure mode worse than no check.
// Source: developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/ha -- cluster traffic
// is "always forced to https since only TLS connections are used between
// servers"; the active node mints an ECDSA-P521 cert for it.
//
// Exit codes: 0 = coherent, 1 = findings, 2 = usage/IO error.

/**
 * The chart revision behind every encoded behaviour in this file.
 *
 * 0.29.1 -> 0.34.1 on 2026-09-01, RE-MEASURED rather than renumbered. This constant
 * exists so a version cannot move underneath the rules without someone checking, and
 * the check it demands is a render comparison, not a judgement call. What was done:
 *
 *   `helm template` at BOTH versions, with the Application's own valuesObject and the
 *   same --kube-version, then a structural diff of the results:
 *
 *     18 resources at 0.29.1, 18 at 0.34.1 -- NONE added, NONE removed
 *     13 differ at all, and 11 of those differ ONLY by the `helm.sh/chart` label
 *     the 3 substantive differences are image bumps (vault-k8s 1.5.0 -> 1.7.6,
 *       vault 1.18.1 -> 2.0.4) plus one new startup guard in the StatefulSet that
 *       greps storageconfig.hcl for `autopilot_redundancy_zone`
 *
 * So every SHAPE these rules reason about -- topology and replica counts, raft
 * retry_join, the PDB, the seal stanza, listener scheme against VAULT_ADDR,
 * anti-affinity, the storage class at its sync wave, the injector -- renders
 * identically at both versions. The audit then ran clean at the new pin: 12 rules,
 * 0 findings.
 *
 * WHAT THIS EVIDENCE DOES NOT COVER, said plainly because "the audit passes" must not
 * be read as more than it is: the Vault APPLICATION goes 1.18.1 -> 2.0.4, a major.
 * These rules encode what the CHART renders from our values, not what the Vault binary
 * does with the resulting config, and no rule here would notice a behavioural change
 * inside Vault 2.0. That is a separate question from this constant.
 *
 * The direction is still strongly favourable: hashicorp/vault:1.18.1 was last
 * published 2024-10-30 -- nearly two years -- and 2.0.4 on 2026-08-04.
