// measure-triangle-corners.ts — the meter for a goal that had none.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
// --------------------
// Aaron, 2026-09-06: "we have generator plus joins plus observability, and over time we want
// this triangle to move more data points to generators over observability, because
// observability costs more."
//
// That is a DIRECTION OF TRAVEL, and a direction with no instrument is an aspiration. Stated
// without a meter it can only ever be asserted, never checked, and this repo's standing
// refusal is that an unfalsifiable claim looks exactly like a satisfied one. So this file
// measures where the tracked bytes actually sit, and — the part that matters — how the
// composition MOVES between two revisions.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT
// --------------
// It is not a cost model. Aaron's claim is that observability costs more; that is a claim about
// storage, re-reading, staleness and re-verification, and this measures NONE of those. It
// measures byte composition, which is a proxy that can be wrong in both directions (a tiny
// baseline file can cost enormous attention; a large generated table can cost nothing). The
// proxy is named here so it cannot be quoted as the cost measurement it is not.
//
// THE CLASSIFICATION IS THE ARGUABLE PART, SO IT IS PUBLISHED
// ----------------------------------------------------------
// A meter is good when anyone can inspect it and agree to its rules before the measurement
// (`.claude/rules/dual-use-detection-is-neutral-oracle-decides.md`). The rules are the exported
// `RULES` table below, first-match-wins, each with the reason it is where it is. Disagree with a
// row and the number changes — that is the intended failure mode, not a defect.
//
// Two classification calls worth arguing with up front:
//
//   * TESTS ARE GENERATORS, baselines and golden vectors are OBSERVABILITY. A test re-derives
//     its verdict on every run; a golden vector is a retained data point the test compares
//     against. This follows the diode in the research doc — an executable artifact is a
//     generator the next run can execute, a stored one is a point.
//
//   * PROSE IS REPORTED SEPARATELY, not folded into observability. The research doc argues
//     prose is an observation ABOUT a generator, which would put `docs/**` in the expensive
//     corner and make the headline ratio swing on the most contested call in the table. Folding
//     it in would let the classification decide the result. It is counted, shown, and left out
//     of the ratio.
//
// REFUSALS
// --------
//   * unclassified bytes over MAX_UNCLASSIFIED_FRACTION — a number computed over a tree the
//     rules do not cover is not a measurement of that tree. It names the largest uncovered
//     directories so the table can be extended.
//   * `--since <rev>` against a rev that does not resolve.
//
// Usage:
//   bun src/Core.TypeScript/hygiene/measure-triangle-corners.ts [--at <rev>] [--since <rev>] [--json]
