/**
 * Refuse a Kubernetes version literal that disagrees with the declaration.
 *
 * THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR, measured 2026-09-01: the tree carried THREE separate
 * Kubernetes version literals and TWO different answers, and neither was what the
 * cluster runs.
 *
 *   audit-observability-chain.ts          1.31.0
 *   validate-applications.ts              1.33.0
 *   gate.yml (kubeconform)                1.33.0
 *   k3s, from this repo's own flake lock  1.35.6
 *
 * The kubeconform pin's own comment names that exact drift -- "Two lanes validating
 * the same kinds against two different Kubernetes versions is the drift this closes"
 * -- and it closed two lanes and left a third. A hand-applied fix reaches the places
 * its author grepped for; this reaches the places that exist.
 *
 * WHY A STALE VERSION IS NOT MERELY COSMETIC, and why this is a gate rather than a
 * report: it fails in BOTH directions. Too low REJECTS charts that would install
 * (mimir-distributed 6.x needs >= 1.32 and could not render at 1.31.0). Too low also
 * CLEARS charts using APIs removed after the declared version -- they validate here
 * and fail on the real cluster. That direction is silent, which makes it the dangerous
 * one, and silence is exactly what a linter is for.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT CHECK, said plainly: that the declaration matches the flake. That
 * needs `nix` and a flake evaluation, which is not available in every lane this runs
 * in. The declaration records the command that derives it, and moving the lock without
 * moving the declaration is a gap this cannot see. Named here rather than implied.
