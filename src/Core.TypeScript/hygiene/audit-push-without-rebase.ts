// audit-push-without-rebase.ts — AH001: a commit-back lane that can destroy its own work.
//
// The rule this enforces
// ----------------------
// **Accidental heat is work destroyed by a lane that had a reversible form available
// and did not take it.** A workflow that commits and then `git push`es WITHOUT first
// rebasing loses the race whenever the remote has moved — and the commit it just built
// is erased. The frame was always landable; the lane simply did not know how to
// re-express it onto a moved base.
//
// Rebase is the reversible form: `Adj`-shaped in the Landauer sense, a re-expression of
// the same work that loses nothing. A failed bare push is an ERASURE — non-Adj, pays,
// and nobody consented to it.
//
// Live instance (2026-08-10): `tick-metrics` (run 31428773872) computed a correct metric
// frame, committed it, and lost it to a non-fast-forward rejection. It was the last
// commit-back lane still pushing bare; `lockfile-healer` and `drift-sweep` then rebased,
// and later moved onto `flush-via-staging.ts` (the write itself is no longer a bare
// `git push` in those YAML run-blocks). Two lockfile breaks the same day were the same
// class — a lane that is fine in isolation and fails only under fleet concurrency.
//
// Why this is mechanically checkable when "waste" is not
// ------------------------------------------------------
// The question is not "was this expensive" — unanswerable in general. It is: **did a
// reversible retry form exist and go unused?** For a git write that reduces to a text
// question about the run block, and it is exact.
//
// Rule 0: TypeScript (no .sh) per `.claude/rules/rule-0-no-sh-files.md`.
