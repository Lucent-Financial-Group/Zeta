// audit-pr-archive-coverage.ts — the falsifier for the condition nobody was
// measuring: merged PRs that never get an archive record at all.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
// --------------------
// The PR-review archive exists to move review discussion out of GitHub's
// database and into git, where the project owns it and can train on it. Every
// unarchived PR is data the project does not own — and, unlike a broken build,
// its absence produces no signal whatsoever. There is no failed run to find, no
// red check, no error in a log. It is invisible by construction.
//
// It was invisible for four days. Measured on main at 2026-08-25:
//
//     merged PRs (GraphQL totalCount)            13,347
//     archive docs on main                       10,337
//     lifetime coverage                           77.4%
//     unarchived                                  3,010
//
// THE MECHANISM, MEASURED — it is not one failure, it is three populations.
//
//   A. 578 PRs the lane DELIBERATELY skips (`automation/pr-archive-*` and
//      `claim/archive-pr-*` — archiving an archive PR is a recursive chain).
//      Not a gap. See `archive-eligibility.ts` for why this had to become a
//      shared predicate rather than a rule each lane re-guessed.
//
//   B. 1,506 PRs merged before `pr-archive-on-merge.yml` landed (2026-05-06).
//      A real category, and one no fix to the lane can ever move — only a
//      deliberate backfill can. Counted, never quietly folded into either the
//      healthy number or the failure number.
//
//   C. 926 eligible PRs the lane SHOULD have archived and did not — 765 of them
//      since 2026-08-21, i.e. still happening while this was written.
//
// THE ROOT CAUSE OF (C), and it is a documented GitHub behaviour rather than a
// bug in this repo's code: **a workflow authenticating as `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot
// trigger another workflow.** When a PR is merged by `github-actions[bot]`, the
// `pull_request: closed` event is SUPPRESSED, so `pr-archive-on-merge.yml`
// never runs. No run is created; nothing fails; nothing is red.
//
// Checked, not assumed — two samples over the same 5-day window:
//
//     population                          merged by github-actions   by a user
//     unarchived + eligible (n=765)                 747 (97.6%)     18 ( 2.4%)
//     archived, same window (n=539)                   9 ( 1.7%)    530 (98.3%)
//
// and directly, by asking the API whether a run exists for the merge SHA:
//
//     PR #15280 heartbeat/society   merged by github-actions[bot] -> 0 runs
//     PR #15267 soraya-flush        merged by github-actions[bot] -> 0 runs
//     PR #15272 heartbeat/tick-metrics  merged by AceHack         -> 1 run, success
//     PR #15264 heartbeat/society       merged by AceHack         -> 1 run, success
//
// The bot-merge share of all merges crossed over on 2026-08-20 (9/40 on 08-18,
// 11/40 on 08-19, 29/40 on 08-20), which is the day before coverage collapsed.
// The lane did not break. Its trigger stopped being reachable for a population
// that had, until then, been small.
//
// WHY AN AUDIT AND NOT JUST A FIX
// -------------------------------
// Because the fix is to a SUPPRESSED EVENT, and the next thing that suppresses
// it will be just as silent. The backfill sweep is the net under the event lane,
// and the net's own health has exactly the same property: it is a number nobody
// looks at until someone counts files by hand. This audit is what makes 77.4% a
// value that goes red.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS
// ---------------
// Two numbers, two thresholds, and they answer different questions:
//
//   * WINDOW coverage (default: last 7 days, minus a grace period) — "is the
//     lane working RIGHT NOW". This is the one that catches a new break within a
//     day, and it is the one whose threshold is high.
//   * LIFETIME coverage over eligible PRs — "how much of the corpus do we own".
//     Moves only when a backfill lands, so it is a ratchet, not an alarm.
//
// LIVENESS: this audit refuses to pass while inspecting nothing. An empty
// archive index or an empty merged list means the lookup is broken, not that
// coverage is perfect — "checked 0 PRs" must never read as success. That is the
// vacuity class, and it is the failure this whole subsystem keeps producing.

/**
 * The defaults, and why each is the number it is.
 *
 * `window` at 0.95 rather than 1.0: the event lane and the backfill sweep race,
 * flushes batch, and a handful of records legitimately straddle the grace
 * boundary on a busy day. 1.0 would flap. 0.95 over 7 days is roughly 130 PRs
 * of slack at the current merge rate, which no real break fits inside — the
 * measured break ran at 43% coverage.
 *
 * BACKTESTED, because a threshold argued from first principles is a guess with
 * a paragraph attached. Replaying this exact computation against the real merge
 * history for the fifteen days around the break:
 *
 *     2026-08-11 .. 08-20    100.00% every day      GREEN  (10 healthy days)
 *     2026-08-21              94.62%                RED    <- day ONE of the break
 *     2026-08-22              80.37%                RED
 *     2026-08-23              73.04%                RED
 *     2026-08-24              64.50%                RED
 *     2026-08-25              59.22%                RED
 *
 * So 0.95 has both properties a threshold needs and which are usually only
 * asserted: it does not flap on ten consecutive days of healthy operation, and
 * it fires on the FIRST day of the real incident rather than after it has
 * accumulated. Raising it to 0.99 would still have caught 08-21; lowering it to
 * 0.90 would have missed it for a day. (The pre-break days use today's archived
 * set, so they are upper bounds — which only strengthens the no-flap half.)
 *
 * `lifetime` is a RATCHET at the level a backfill can hold, not an aspiration.
 * It starts below where main sits so the audit lands green-on-truth rather than
 * red-on-history, and it is raised as backfill lands. A threshold set above the
 * current value would make this audit's first act be to fail for a reason it
 * cannot fix, which is how gates get disabled.
