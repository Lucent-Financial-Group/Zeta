/**
 * FSharp.Core's locked bytes must be nuget.org's SIGNED package, never the SDK's copy.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The .NET SDK ships FSharp.Core inside `FSharp/library-packs` and adds
 * that folder as a restore source, where it beats nuget.org. The artifacts are genuinely
 * different files, and differ PER PLATFORM. Measured 2026-09-12 for 10.1.400:
 *
 *   nuget.org (signed, carries .signature.p7s)   3,065,316 bytes
 *   macOS SDK 10.0.400 library-packs             3,050,245 bytes
 *   linux SDK 10.0.400 library-packs             3,049,932 bytes
 *
 * A `packages.lock.json` records ONE contentHash. So if the SDK folder is in play, no single
 * set of lock files can satisfy the gate's platform legs, and restore fails NU1403 on
 * whichever platform did not generate them. That is not hypothetical: it is what happened,
 * on every Linux leg, naming FSharp.Core and no other package.
 *
 * `Directory.Build.props` prevents it by pointing the SDK's own `_FSharpCoreLibraryPacksFolder`
 * at a path that does not exist, so the SDK's `Exists()` guard declines to add the source.
 * That is an SDK-INTERNAL (underscore) property. It can be renamed or removed by any SDK
 * update, and if it is, restore silently starts resolving from the SDK again and the next
 * regenerated lock file carries the SDK's hash. Nothing else would notice: the build would
 * be green on the machine that regenerated, and red on every other platform.
 *
 * This audit is what notices. It reads the COMMITTED lock files and refuses any FSharp.Core
 * contentHash that is not nuget.org's.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not hit the network. The expected hash is pinned
 * below as a constant, because a check that fetches the value it is checking against cannot
 * fail when the fetch fails, and `.claude/rules/clone-at-tag-stays-sufficient.md` requires
 * the tree to stay checkable from a clone at a tag with nothing installed.
