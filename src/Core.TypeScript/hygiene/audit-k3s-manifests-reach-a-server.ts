// audit-k3s-manifests-reach-a-server.ts — a manifest declared on an agent is never applied.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
// --------------------
// `services.k3s.manifests` writes each entry as a flat `<name>.yaml` into
// `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests`, and the k3s DEPLOY CONTROLLER submits them. That
// controller runs on a k3s SERVER. On an agent the files are written and nothing reads them —
// no error, no warning, no applied resource.
//
// MEASURED 2026-09-07 by evaluating the flake, which is how this audit came to exist:
//
//   nixosConfigurations.worker-gpu.config.services.k3s.role      => "agent"
//   nixosConfigurations.worker-gpu.config.services.k3s.manifests => [ local-path-provisioner,
//                                                                    nvidia-device-plugin ]
//   nixosConfigurations.control-plane.config.services.k3s.manifests => 12 entries,
//                                                                      nvidia-device-plugin NOT among them
//
// So the NVIDIA device-plugin DaemonSet is declared exactly once, on the one node that cannot
// apply it, and `gpu-device-plugin.nix` says in its own comment that the K3S-manifest path is
// the only route ("a future k8s/applications/gpu-device-plugin/ Application could take over
// ... but it doesn't exist yet"). There is no such Application. The consequence is not subtle:
// GPUs are never advertised to the scheduler, so a GPU pod stays Pending forever — and every
// check in the tree passes, because nothing was ever wired to notice.
//
// WHAT IT CHECKS
// --------------
// For every host configuration: if it imports a module that sets `services.k3s.manifests`, the
// host must also import a module that sets `role = "server"`. Static and cheap — no `nix`
// required, so it runs in the ordinary TypeScript lane rather than needing an evaluator.
//
// HONEST LIMIT, stated because a check that overstates its reach is worse than none: this reads
// IMPORT LISTS, not evaluated configuration. A module reached transitively (a module importing
// another module) is followed one level; a `role` set by an option default rather than by an
// imported module is not seen. It is a proxy for the eval, chosen because it can run everywhere.
// The eval above is the ground truth and is quoted in the finding so a reader can re-run it.
