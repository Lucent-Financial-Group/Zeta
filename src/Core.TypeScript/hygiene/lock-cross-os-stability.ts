// lock-cross-os-stability.ts — does `dotnet restore` resolve the SAME
// `packages.lock.json` on every platform the gate runs on?
//
// -- WHY THIS EXISTS --------------------------------------------------------
// PR #17305 landed 63 `packages.lock.json` files and `--locked-mode` at three call
// sites, and deliberately did NOT widen it to the solution-wide gate job. Its stated
// reason, quoted from `docs/NUGET-LOCK-FILES.md`:
//
//   "the gate runs on ubuntu, windows and macos, and a lock file that legitimately
//    differs per-OS would turn a supply-chain check into a cross-platform flake.
//    Widening locked mode to the full solution wants a measurement of cross-OS lock
//    stability first, on a lane that can fail loudly without blocking `main`."
//
// This is the measurement. It is not a gate and must never become one on the strength
// of its own output — see the header of `.github/workflows/lock-cross-os-stability.yml`.
//
// -- WHAT IT ACTUALLY COMPARES ----------------------------------------------
// Each platform leg re-resolves with `--force-evaluate` (a plain restore is a NO-OP
// against a lock whose project-input hash still matches, so it would measure nothing)
// and captures every `packages.lock.json` verbatim. This module then compares those
// captures against each other AND against the committed files.
//
// The verdict vocabulary is deliberately five-valued, not two. Collapsing it to
// same/different would hide the only distinction that decides the question:
//
//   identical                    every platform, byte-for-byte, and equal to committed.
//   uniform-drift-from-committed every platform agrees with every other and DISAGREES
//                                with what is checked in. Not a cross-OS finding at all
//                                — it is a stale committed lock, and it is the gate's
//                                problem rather than this lane's.
//   differs-formatting-only    parsed JSON is deep-equal; the raw bytes are not. Newlines
//                                (CRLF on the Windows legs), key order, whitespace. Named
//                                rather than normalised away, because silently normalising
//                                is how a real difference hides behind a formatting one --
//                                and because a CRLF-only split still costs a `--locked-mode`
//                                gate a `git diff` if the checkout normalises differently.
//   differs-for-a-declared-reason  the differing entries are ALL runtime/RID-shaped AND
//                                the project actually declares a RuntimeIdentifier or an
//                                OS-suffixed TargetFramework. Both halves required.
//   differs-unexplained          everything else. THIS is the finding. A RID-shaped
//                                difference in a project that never asked for a RID is
//                                unexplained, not declared — nothing in the tree
//                                requested it, so calling it "expected" would be the
//                                rubber stamp this lane exists to avoid.
//
// -- THE HALF THAT IS EASY TO GET WRONG -------------------------------------
// A classifier that can only say "declared" is a check that cannot fail. The declared
// path is therefore conjunctive (shape AND declaration) and the falsifiers in
// `lock-cross-os-stability.test.ts` include a control that perturbs one lock and asserts
// the verdict is `differs-unexplained` — the mutation the rest of the file is judged by.
