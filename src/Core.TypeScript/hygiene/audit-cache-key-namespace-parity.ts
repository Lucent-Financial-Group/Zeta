// audit-cache-key-namespace-parity.ts — one cache key FAMILY, one key EXPRESSION.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES (measured 2026-08-26, not hypothesised).
//   `gate.yml` caches NuGet under
//       nuget-${{ runner.os }}-${{ runner.arch }}-${{ hashFiles('Directory.Packages.props') }}
//   while `low-memory.yml` and `codeql.yml` used
//       nuget-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('Directory.Packages.props') }}
//   — the same content, the same hash inputs, under TWO KEY NAMESPACES that can
//   never restore each other. Same split on `elan`. Both halves were measured:
//
//     * the itemised `actions/caches` endpoint held the SAME
//       `Directory.Packages.props` digest twice — `nuget-Linux-c922cac0…` (357 MB)
//       and `nuget-Linux-ARM64-c922cac0…` (358 MB). Charged twice, ~3.7% of a
//       ~9.31 GiB ceiling, for one dependency set.
//     * the slim lane's own restore logs across 7 consecutive `main` runs:
//       `nuget-Linux-<hash>` missed 5 of 7, `elan-Linux-<hash>` missed 5 of 7,
//       while gate.yml's copies sat in the cache under the arch-qualified key
//       the whole time.
//
//   A save whose restore key never matches is a save that does nothing: it looks
//   like a working cache, costs a full upload every run, and is never read. That
//   is the vacuity class wearing a green checkmark, which is the shape this repo
//   has been bitten by repeatedly.
//
// WHY A CHECK AND NOT A COMMENT. The convention was ALREADY WRITTEN DOWN, twice,
// and still drifted:
//   * gate.yml: "Cache keys include `runner.arch` … so Linux x64 (ubuntu-24.04,
//     ubuntu-slim) and Linux arm64 (ubuntu-24.04-arm) do not share entries" —
//     it names `ubuntu-slim`, the lane that was violating it.
//   * codeql.yml: "Keys on Directory.Packages.props - same as gate.yml" — a
//     comment asserting a parity the code did not have.
//   * lean-proof.yml got it RIGHT ("Same key shape as gate.yml's elan cache so
//     the two workflows share cache space efficiently"), which proves the
//     convention was understood and simply not enforced.
//   Prose rots; a check does not.
//
// WHAT IT CHECKS. Group every `actions/cache*` key by its FAMILY — the literal
// (non-`${{ }}`) text of the key, which is the part that carves the namespace.
// Within a family, every occurrence must use the IDENTICAL key expression.
//
//   nuget-${{ runner.os }}-${{ runner.arch }}-${{ hashFiles(…) }}  ─┐ family "nuget"
//   nuget-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles(…) }}                     ─┘ DIFFERENT expr → VIOLATION
//
//   install-${{ … }}-${{ … }}-base-${{ … }}   family "install|base"  ─┐ different
//   install-${{ … }}-${{ … }}-full-${{ … }}   family "install|full"  ─┘ families, both fine
//
// NOT "every key must contain runner.arch". That proxy would flag `lake-…` in
// lean-proof.yml, which is used in exactly ONE workflow and therefore cannot
// disagree with anything — forcing either a pointless cold rebuild of the
// Mathlib olean cache or a hand-written allowlist that drifts from the code.
// This audit needs NO allowlist: a single-use family is consistent by
// construction, and consistency is the property that actually matters.
//
// Exit 0 = every family uses one expression · 1 = lists the divergent families
//        · 2 = the scan itself failed (missing dir, or implausibly few keys).
