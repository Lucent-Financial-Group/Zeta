// privacy-frost-demo.ts — the end-to-end run: an agent EARNS a balance, SPENDS it to frost a
// region, and a NON-OWNER defrost is REFUSED. On a real machine, against a real book on disk.
//
// WHY A DEMO IS PART OF THE WORK. The parts of this capability all existed before today and none
// of them composed (PR #15407). An unrun capability is the vacuity class — it looks like a
// guarantee and carries none — so the composition is not "done" until it has been executed
// end to end and the output pasted somewhere a human can read it.
//
// EPHEMERAL BY DESIGN. Everything this writes lives in `db/ledgers/privacy/`, which is gitignored
// per-machine runtime state. It is expected to be wiped repeatedly:
//
//   what a reset destroys   every attestation and spend — i.e. every agent's balance and every
//                           frost receipt on this host. Nothing else.
//   what rebuilds it        this command. `--reset` wipes first, then rebuilds from scratch.
//   what it cannot break    the repo. No test reads this directory, no build step consults it,
//                           and `load()` treats a missing file as an EMPTY book rather than an
//                           error — so a wiped host is a fresh host, never a broken one.
//
// Usage:
//   bun src/Core.TypeScript/ledger/privacy-frost-demo.ts [--reset] [--ledger <path>]
//
// Exit codes: 0 every step behaved as required · 1 a step did NOT (the demo is self-checking).
