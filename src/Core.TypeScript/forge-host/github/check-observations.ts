/**
 * forge-host/github/check-observations.ts — the GitHub Actions implementation of the
 * `CheckObservationSource` half of the forge-host plugin contract.
 *
 * GitHub is *a* forge host, never *the* forge host. Everything specific to it lives
 * behind this file; the dashboard's fold never sees a workflow, a run id, or a
 * conclusion string.
 *
 * THE MEASUREMENT THAT DICTATES THE SHAPE (2026-08-22, this repo):
 *   • 81 active workflows.
 *   • `gh run list --branch main --limit 200` contained runs from **22** of them —
 *     heartbeat traffic saturates the window; its oldest run was from 15:25 the SAME DAY.
 *   • Latest-run-per-workflow immediately surfaced four workflows failing unseen,
 *     one of them red since 08-16.
 * A window sample is not a slow instrument. It is a structurally blind one, and its
 * blindness renders as green. So: roster first, then one query per roster entry, and
 * never a global window.
 *
 * CANCELLED IS NOT GREEN AND IT IS NOT RED. `platform-drift-report.ts` measured 265 of
 * 300 recent `gate` push runs `cancelled` — main pushes arrive faster than a run takes
 * and Actions cancels the older pending one. A cancelled run's legs never execute, so
 * it establishes NO verdict. Reporting it as anything but "we did not learn anything"
 * would be the vacuity class with an API response attached.
