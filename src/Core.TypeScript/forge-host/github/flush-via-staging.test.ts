// THE MECHANISM, refined by what red-state showed (see UNTREATED): the run's actor
// is the identity that produced the event. A `pull_request` **opened** event comes
// from `gh pr create` (the PAT -> AceHack), so a lane whose flush PR lands every
// run always opens a fresh, executing PR. A **synchronize** event comes from the
// `git push`, so once a flush PR is stuck open, every subsequent flush is a
// GITHUB_TOKEN-actored synchronize and parks. That is self-sustaining: parked
// gate -> unmergeable PR -> never re-created -> next flush is another synchronize.
// Society sat in that loop for three days. The push credential is what breaks it.
//
// These assertions are the pin. Each one names the regression it catches, and the
// ORDERING assertion is the load-bearing one — #10913's fallback ran, logged that
// it ran, and was denied under the same identity, so a repair that is applied and
// never re-checked is indistinguishable from one that worked.

 * Lanes deliberately still on the default credential, and WHY.
 *
 * This is not an oversight and the assertion below exists so it cannot decay into
 * one. #10850 broke three lanes at once for ~16.75h by changing them together, so
 * lanes are treated one at a time with a reading in between.
 *
 * `red-state` is NOT a control showing the defect — it is a lane where the defect
 * is LATENT, and saying so is the honest register. Measured 2026-08-17: 92
 * `pull_request` runs on `heartbeat/red-state`, only 12 parked and all 12 dated
 * 2026-08-14; every run since is `actor=AceHack` and executes. The reason is in
 * the mechanism note above — its flush PRs MERGE (#11067, #11010, #10872, #10870,
 * #10858 all landed on 2026-08-16), so each run opens a fresh PR under the PAT and
 * never reaches a synchronize push. The defect returns the moment one of its PRs
 * stalls, which is exactly how society entered its loop. Treat it on a stall, or
 * pre-emptively with its own before/after reading — do not treat it blind.
 *
 * WHEN YOU TREAT A LANE: move its entry from UNTREATED into TREATED in the same
 * commit as the yaml change, and record the before/after gate reading for that lane
 * in the PR. Do not simply delete the assertion — this list is a claim about what
 * we know, not paperwork.
