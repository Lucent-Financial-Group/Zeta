// archive-eligibility.ts — ONE definition of "which merged PRs are supposed to
// have an archive record", shared by every lane that has an opinion about it.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
// --------------------
// Three surfaces each carried their own answer, and they DISAGREED:
//
//   1. `pr-archive-on-merge.yml`'s `if:` guard SKIPS repo-local
//      `automation/pr-archive-*` and `claim/archive-pr-*` PRs, because archiving
//      an archive PR starts a recursive archive-of-archive chain. That exclusion
//      is deliberate and documented in the workflow.
//   2. `archive-pr-reviews.ts`'s `listMergedPRs` applied NO such filter, so the
//      backfill sweep happily archived exactly what the event lane refuses to.
//   3. Nothing computed coverage at all, so the disagreement was invisible.
//
// Measured on main at 2026-08-25 (13,347 merged PRs, 10,337 archive docs):
//
//   * 1,352 merged PRs match the event lane's exclusion rule.
//   * 774 of them HAVE an archive doc — written by the backfill sweep, i.e. the
//     exact records the event lane declined to create.
//   * In the sweep's reachable window (the 3,000 newest merged PRs), 524 of the
//     1,289 unarchived PRs are archive-of-archive — so **41% of the sweep's
//     oldest-first budget is spent producing records the other lane calls
//     out-of-scope**, while the real gap behind them is starved.
//
// A coverage number computed against an ambiguous denominator is not a
// measurement, it is a coin flip between two defensible answers. So the
// predicate moves here, and both lanes import it.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
// -------------------
// It does not delete the 774 records that already exist. They are captured
// substrate and §5 (memory preservation) says captured substrate is not thrown
// away because a policy tightened afterwards. The predicate governs what is
// SELECTED going forward and what the coverage denominator counts; it never
// authorises a deletion.

/**
 * Branch-name prefixes the archive lane produces for its OWN bookkeeping.
 *
 * `automation/pr-archive-*` is the per-PR branch `pr-archive-on-merge.yml`
 * pushes; `claim/archive-pr-*` is the repair branch an agent opens when draining
 * a stranded one. A PR whose head is one of these IS an archive record, so
 * archiving it captures the review discussion of a robot commit that has none.
