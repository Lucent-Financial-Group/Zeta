//
// WHY THESE LIVE HERE AND NOT IN THE DASHBOARD.
//
// GitHub is a *forge host*, never *the* forge host, and the stated destination is
// **sovereign mode** — fully decentralized, no centralized forge host at all, with
// author/verifier agent attestations in place of forge gates. A dashboard whose
// model is workflow-run-shaped dies with the forge host. So the vocabulary the
// dashboard folds over is part of the *plugin contract* (host-agnostic by
// construction, this file's whole purpose), and the dashboard core imports only
// these types — never an adapter, never a registry, never `gh`.
//
// The partition is Data Vault 2.0 (`.claude/rules/dv2-data-split-discipline-activated.md`)
// applied to CI observation:
//   hub       — CheckId + Verdict + Expectation: stable, substrate-independent.
//   satellite — SourceDetail: fast-changing, substrate-specific (run id, url, raw
//               conclusion string). Carried for humans, never folded on.

/**
 * Stable identity of a check, independent of who produced it.
 *
 * It must survive the substrate migration: the same logical check observed via a
 * forge host's workflow run today and via an author/verifier attestation tomorrow
 * carries the SAME CheckId, or the dashboard cannot show "the same red" across the
 * change. Adapters mint it from the most stable name the substrate offers (for
 * GitHub Actions: the workflow file's basename without extension — the workflow
 * *name* and numeric id both churn, the path does not).
