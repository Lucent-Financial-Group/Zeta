 * 081M35C7NJR087G0R002S4R654 (WP21) — the decision behind zeta-install.sh's
 * install-time repo pin, and the TypeScript oracle its shell twin
 * (the ZETA-REPO-PIN block in zeta-install.sh) is compared against in
 * repo-pin-shell-parity.test.ts.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES
 * -----------------------
 * `zeta-install.sh` used to `git clone "$REPO_URL" /mnt/etc/zeta` with NO
 * ref, then `nixos-install --flake /mnt/etc/zeta/full-ai-cluster#$HOST`. The
 * installed system was therefore ALWAYS built from the remote's default
 * branch HEAD at INSTALL time, never the commit the ISO (or a zflash-
 * prepared medium) was actually built from and tested against:
 *
 *   - A PR's NixOS-module changes could never be exercised by the real
 *     install path before merge — the QEMU full-install lane always
 *     installed main's copy of every module, regardless of which branch
 *     built the ISO under test.
 *   - In the field, a USB flashed on day X installs whatever `main` happens
 *     to be on day Y.
 *
 * The fix: embed the commit the ISO was built from at build time
 * (`/etc/zeta-iso-provenance`, written by full-ai-cluster/flake.nix from
 * `self.rev`), let a zflash ESP write override it (`/zeta-repo-pin`,
 * src/Core.TypeScript/zflash/lib.ts), and have zeta-install.sh check out
 * that exact commit after cloning. This module is the pure decision core of
 * that checkout: format validation, and what to do when a present pin
 * cannot be honoured. It has NO IO — no git, no filesystem — so it is
 * unit-testable with nothing on disk, and its shell twin's structure is
 * checked to agree with it over every input class.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED BY DEFAULT. An installer that silently installs a different
 * tree than the one it was tested from is exactly the defect class this
 * closes, so a pin that is present but cannot be honoured (junk format, or a
 * checkout that fails) aborts the install unless the operator names the
 * exact override literal (`ZETA_ALLOW_REPO_DRIFT=1`). A pin that is simply
 * ABSENT (hand-built ISO, no ESP override) is not a failure at all — it is
 * today's behaviour, unchanged.
