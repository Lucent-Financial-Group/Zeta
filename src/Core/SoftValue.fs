/// A normalized distribution over candidate `DynamicValue`s. The safety property is NOT
/// "always certain" but **"always knows its uncertainty" (calibration / never falsely
/// certain)**: `resolve` collapses to a definite value ONLY when confidence ≥ a threshold —
/// otherwise it returns `None` (held), exactly like the middle value of a three-valued logic
/// is never silently collapsed. This is the **value-axis generalization of `TriBoolean.Tri.N`
/// and `Predicate3`**: where Predicate3 keeps UNKNOWN on the truth axis, SoftValue keeps a
/// full distribution on the value axis.
///
/// `observe` does a Bayesian update with a likelihood and re-normalizes (sharpening with
/// evidence). Crucially, **independent-evidence observes COMMUTE** — posterior ∝ prior · L₁ · L₂
/// and multiplication commutes — so the uncertainty-merge is order-independent. (That is the
/// crux the convergence-despite-reordering analysis flagged: the Bayesian merge is commutative
/// for independent evidence; proven below.)
///
/// Honesty by construction: an `observe` whose likelihood zeroes every candidate (a
/// contradiction) returns `None` rather than fabricating a value — the seed never invents
/// certainty it doesn't have. Composes [[DynamicValue]] + the never-collapse discipline.
