/// processor. It *composes* the single-arity `FerryThrottler` over
/// `struct('TItem * 'Ctx)`, so all batching / DoP / manual-pump (DST) behaviour is
/// inherited unchanged. Mirrors `ISR` / `Traced.withCtx`: context is a parameter,
/// not ambient state (see `Tracing.fs` on why the explicit Arrow beats the
/// AsyncLocal side channel for legibility + composition).

/// First increment of the async-context-threading work: the caller supplies the
/// context explicitly (no ambient capture). Later increments may add a
/// capture-at-the-boundary convenience and extend context to the result arity.
