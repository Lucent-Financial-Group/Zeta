//  DurabilityTier — the tier model + registration-time classification
//  (081KTF48J3V increment 5; design LOCKED by the maintainer 2026-06-06,
//  docs/research/2026-06-06-durability-tiers-and-per-stream-group-
//  persistence-policy.md §2 + §7).
//  Revived 2026-09-03 from `otto/agent-sovereign-keys-proposal` (tag
//  archive/2026-09-03-branch-sweep/…); PR #10511 landed only that branch's
//  research doc and left this code unlanded. Re-applied onto current main.
//
//  The locked decisions, implemented:
//   • A SMALL FIXED TIER SET joined at registration — `durable` /
//     `derived` / `ephemeral`. No free-form per-table knobs; no
//     per-write overrides (per-write nondeterministic durability is
//     exactly what breaks DST replay — the FDB/TigerBeetle/VoltDB
//     lesson).
//   • DECLARE ONLY THE LEAVES. A source has no upstream the graph could
//     read intent from, so its author says `durable` (an input worth
//     replaying) or `ephemeral` (scratch). Declaring a leaf `derived`
//     is a contradiction in terms and is rejected.
//   • AUTO-CLASSIFY INTERNAL RELATIONS. A relation that is a
//     deterministic function of surviving inputs is `derived` (don't
//     persist — regenerate by replaying the dataflow). A relation fed
//     by ANYTHING ephemeral cannot be regenerated (its input is gone on
//     recovery), so it auto-classifies `ephemeral` — mechanically, with
//     the reason recorded, never silently.
//   • OVERRIDE-UPWARD ALLOWED. An internal relation may be declared a
//     HIGHER tier than its auto-classification (typically `durable`, to
//     snapshot instead of recompute — a recovery-time knob; sound
//     because a durable relation's state is persisted directly, log +
//     snapshot, and restores without consulting its inputs). A
//     DOWNWARD override is rejected: it is how "recovered state
//     references lost state" happens by accident.
//   • THE UPWARD-CLOSED INVARIANT (§2, load-bearing). The set of
//     relations that SURVIVE recovery (`durable` ∪ `derived`) must be
//     upward-closed over the dataflow DAG: every dependency a
//     `derived` relation recomputes from must itself survive. Enforced
//     at classification; a violation names the node AND the offending
//     edge. (`durable` nodes are exempt on the input side — their
//     persistence is self-contained.)
//   • AUDIT-VIA-MANIFEST, not hand-declaration. The computed
//     classification is EMITTED as a generated tier manifest ("X =
//     derived because f(durable Y, Z)") — a queryable, checked-in,
//     deterministic artifact with zero boilerplate. Convention +
//     generated manifest + invariant check.
//
//  Pure and total: classification is a function of the declared graph,
//  Result-over-exception, deterministic output order (binary
//  collation) — the manifest replays byte-identically (DST).
//
//  Anchors: Postgres UNLOGGED (truncate-on-recovery ephemera); Kafka
//  per-topic retention tiers; VoltDB command logging (log inputs,
//  recompute the rest); FASTER epoch checkpoints (the derived-tier
//  recovery boundary); Izraelevitz et al., DISC'16 (buffered durable
//  linearizability — the bar the durable tier builds toward).
