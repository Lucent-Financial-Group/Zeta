//  ZPlan — the TYPED OPERATOR IR over the polymorphic Z-set base atom
//  (081KYWE8Q3508QG0R000KZ5PWR, increment 2: the "typed operator IR /
//  plan node" the increment-1 STATUS listed as STILL OPEN).
//  Revived 2026-09-03 from `otto/agent-sovereign-keys-proposal` (tag
//  archive/2026-09-03-branch-sweep/…); PR #10511 landed only that branch's
//  research doc and left this code unlanded. Re-applied onto current main.
//
//  Aaron 2026-07-31: open-generics dispatch over Z-sets + schema-on-
//  Z-sets "is our entire db stored-proc architecture long term." This
//  file is the piece that joins the two shipped halves: `ZAtomDispatch`
//  gave us ONE dispatched operator applied to ONE Z-set; a stored
//  procedure is a PLAN — a tree of operators over named sources — and
//  the plan must be checkable BEFORE any row is touched. The shape a
//  stored procedure compiles to (`ZAtom.fs` docstring): "the plan names
//  an operator, the rows name their types, and the dictionary joins
//  them." Here the joining happens twice, deliberately:
//   • AT PLAN TIME — `inferTypes`/`validate` runs a TYPE-FLOW analysis:
//     each node's possible type-tag set is computed from the sources'
//     declared tags, and every `Dispatch` node is checked against the
//     registry (tag registered? operator implemented?). A plan that can
//     meet an unroutable row is rejected as a PLAN, with every failure
//     listed — not discovered row-by-row in production.
//   • AT RUN TIME — `run` evaluates the tree with the same all-or-
//     nothing loud-failure discipline as `ZAtomDispatch.mapValues`
//     (nothing silently dropped; a partial result would be a silent
//     drop wearing an `Ok`).
//
//  THE IR IS DELIBERATELY Z-LINEAR. Every constructor denotes a
//  Z-linear operator (`Source` = projection, `Dispatch` = key-rewrite
//  with weight untouched, `FilterType` = restriction, `Sum` = group
//  add, `Negate` = additive inverse), so EVERY plan `p` satisfies
//  `run p (a + b) = run p a + run p b` — a quantified law in
//  ZPlan.Tests.fs, not a hope. By DBSP linearity (Budiu et al., VLDB
//  2023: linear ⇒ `Q^Δ = Q`) a ZPlan is its OWN incremental form: feed
//  it deltas and it emits deltas, no lifting required. Nonlinear nodes
//  (distinct, join) are deliberately ABSENT from this increment — each
//  needs its integration story stated before it can ride the IR, and an
//  IR that quietly mixes linear and nonlinear nodes loses the theorem
//  that makes plans-as-deltas sound.
//
//  SCHEMA IS THE SOURCE DECLARATION. `sourceTypesOfLog` bridges the
//  schema plane (`SchemaLog`, the fold-is-the-schema event log) to the
//  type-flow analysis: a source's declared tag set is the fold of its
//  schema log, so "validate this stored proc against the live schema"
//  is `validateAgainstLogs` — the SchemaLog→stored-proc wiring the Q40
//  work-item names.
//
//  Anchors (Beacon): Wadler & Blott 1989 (the registry as explicit
//  dictionary); Budiu et al., DBSP (VLDB 2023) §linear operators;
//  Green, Karvounarakis & Tannen (PODS 2007) — the weight ring the rows
//  ride; Codd 1970 (plans over declared schemas, checked before data).
