/// **DeterministicSyncContext** — a single-threaded, pumpable `SynchronizationContext`
/// for Deterministic Simulation Testing of async code (Option-A increment 4b).
///
/// `Post` captures each continuation into a FIFO queue; **nothing runs ambiently**.
/// `PumpToIdle` runs the queued continuations in registration order until the queue
/// is empty (a continuation may post more — those run too). Because every `await`
/// under this context re-`Post`s its continuation here, an async workload launched
/// onto it advances **only** when pumped, in a fixed, seed-independent, replayable
/// order — so the same inputs replay to byte-identical results (FoundationDB-style
/// single-thread determinism; Zhou et al., SIGMOD 2021).
///
/// This is the deterministic implementation of the **noninterference door**
/// (manifesto §13 / discipline #7): scheduling entropy enters async code only
/// through this declared, metered channel — never the ambient threadpool. Inject it
/// where production injects nothing (e.g. `FerryThrottler`'s `?syncContext`) to make
/// the background path replayable without changing that path.
///
/// **Earned class** (per `interfaces-free-classes-earned-under-rules`): a class
/// carries state ⇒ weight, so it must be justified. The earning: this state (the
/// FIFO run-queue) **is** the simulated scheduler's queue — the very thing replay
/// reflects over. A pure interface cannot hold a mutable run-queue; the DST +
/// injected-`SynchronizationContext` boundary is the rule that earns it. It is a
/// sim/test primitive, not a production scheduler.
///
/// The continuation queue is **lock-free** (discipline #2): a `ConcurrentQueue<T>`
/// with `Interlocked` on the counter, since `Post` runs from arbitrary threads while
/// one thread pumps. No hand-rolled CAS class — the BCL queue is the earned-correct
/// implementation of the lock-free FIFO.
///
/// Prior art (Beacon): Stephen Cleary, *Nito.AsyncEx* `AsyncContext` (single-thread
/// pump-based `SynchronizationContext`); Stephen Toub, "await, SynchronizationContext,
/// and Console Apps" (the single-threaded-pump pattern); WPF/WinForms
/// `DispatcherSynchronizationContext` (the marshal-to-one-thread shape this mirrors
/// for determinism rather than UI affinity). Lock-free FIFO: Michael & Scott,
/// "Simple, Fast, and Practical Non-Blocking and Blocking Concurrent Queue
/// Algorithms" (PODC 1996) — the lineage `ConcurrentQueue<T>` implements. Human
/// anchor for the lock-free `ConcurrentQueue` + CAS approach: Joseph Albahari,
/// *Threading in C#* §"Nonblocking Synchronization" — the published
/// `Interlocked.CompareExchange` optimistic-update loop with `SpinWait` backoff —
/// with Stephen Toub (`Interlocked` / `SpinWait` guidance, `AsyncProducerConsumerQueue`)
/// and David Fowler (`System.Threading.Channels`) as the standing .NET concurrency
/// lineage. That optimistic loop lives in this repo as `Atomic.speculativeUpdate`
/// (`SpeculativeUpdate.fs`).
