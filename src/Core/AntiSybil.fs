/// **`AntiSybil` — the base case that makes `clock-drift ≡ identity` non-circular (Aaron 2026-06-08).**
///
/// Soraya called `clock-drift ≡ identity` "circular/definitional." That verdict is *behavioralist-loaded*:
/// drop behavioralism (intentions are real — GOVERNANCE §3) and the identification is **synthetic** — drift
/// is the agent's only **unforgeable** external trace. The self-reference is **meta-circular** (a productive
/// fixed point grounded by a base case), which *compiles*. **This module is that base case.**
///
/// **The anti-Sybil claim (the falsifiable core):** forging *k* distinct drift-identities costs **≥ *k*
/// independent entropy sources** — clock-drift entropy is **non-fungible across identities**. A Sybil forger
/// claiming *k* identities from *s &lt; k* sources must (pigeonhole) re-use a source across two claims, so two
/// of its emitted bit-streams are **correlated**. The `probe` (`BitGan`) becomes a **distinguishing oracle**:
/// a discriminator confined to observed bits can beat chance on a correlated pair ⇒ the forgery is caught.
///
/// **Proof-of-distinctness**, structurally identical to how proof-of-work grounds a blockchain's otherwise
/// circular "longest chain is truth": the circle bottoms out on a hardness fact, and the hardness does the
/// work. Anchors: Douceur 2002 (*The Sybil Attack*); Dwork–Naor 1992 / Nakamoto 2008 (PoW); the
/// jitter/ring-oscillator TRNG non-reproducibility that makes two clocks' drift uncheaply-mergeable (#7091).
///
/// **Honest scope (peel):** this is **sound for exact replays** (a re-used source ⇒ correlation `1.0` ⇒
/// always caught). For *noisy* forgeries and at *finite* stream length there is a detection/length tradeoff:
/// genuinely-independent streams can spuriously correlate at short length (false positive), with probability
/// shrinking as length grows. So the guarantee is: *exact source-reuse is always detected*; noisy reuse is
/// detected above a length/threshold curve. This is the attack-research surface — route to Aminata/Mateo
/// before any outward "Sybil-resistance via drift non-fungibility" claim. Not yet a proved theorem: a named
/// function + a falsifiable property + an attack program.
