/// **Veridicality — provenance-aware claim scoring (foundation).**
///
/// This module hosts the primitives for what the bootstrap-era
/// conversation called the "bullshit detector" and Amara's
/// subsequent ferries (7th-10th) formalized as veridicality
/// scoring. The name `Veridicality` (from Latin *veridicus*,
/// "truth-telling") names the scorable quantity: how true-to-
/// reality a claim looks given its provenance, falsifiability,
/// coherence, drift, and compression-gap signals. "Bullshit" is
/// the informal inverse (`bullshit = 1 - veridicality`).
///
/// **First graduation (this file):** `Provenance` + `Claim<'T>`
/// record types + `validateProvenance`. These are the input
/// shapes for every downstream scorer. The actual veridicality
/// scorer (`V(c) = σ(β₀ + β₁(1-P) + β₂(1-F) + β₃(1-K) + …)` from
/// Amara's 7th ferry, or `BS(c) = σ(w₁·C + w₂·(1-P) + …)` from
/// the 10th ferry) is a separate graduation that composes over
/// these types.
///
/// **Attribution.**
/// * **Concept** — the bullshit-detector / provenance-aware-
///   scoring framing is Aaron's design, present in the bootstrap
///   conversation (`docs/amara-full-conversation/**`) before
///   Amara's ferries formalized it. Aaron 2026-04-24 Otto-112:
///   *"bullshit, it was in our conversation history too, not
///   just her ferry."*
/// * **Formalization** — Amara (7th/8th/9th/10th ferries):
///   veridicality formula, semantic-canonicalization "rainbow
///   table", oracle-rule specification, 7-feature composite.
/// * **Implementation** — Otto, under the Otto-105 graduation
///   cadence. Fifth graduation.
///
/// Future graduations add (in priority order): `antiConsensusGate`
/// (requires `Provenance`); `canonicalizeClaim` (semantic
/// canonicalization → `CanonicalClaimKey`); `scoreVeridicality`
/// (the composite function).
