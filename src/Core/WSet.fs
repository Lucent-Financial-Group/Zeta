/// It is NOT a claim that this substrate is physically quantum, nor that the trace exploits quantum
/// mechanics; it is the same GDL circuit (Aji–McEliece 2000) run over a different semiring.
/// **Related, not identified:** Clifford generator squares ±1 are the *signature* of Cl(p,q), not this

/// The VALUE ping-return needs `IStarRing` (Negate). FourCorner is not Cl(p,q). See `FourCornerC4`.
///
/// **HONESTY — the retraction is Landauer-FREE, so Landauer does not meter it.** `WSet.negate` is a
/// self-inverse *bijection* of the state space, so by Bennett 1973 it erases nothing and costs nothing;
/// a Landauer meter placed on it must read zero for every input, forever. That is a property of the
/// operation, not a weak instrument — which is why "the retraction is reversible" is TRUE but carries no
/// thermodynamic content, and cannot be evidence that the fold as a whole runs reversibly. The erasure is
/// elsewhere: `consolidate`, `discard`, `bornProb`, `plus` and `tensor` are all non-injective, and
/// `consolidate` is the sharp case — the annihilation the comment on it describes (`+w` and `−w` cancel)
/// maps two distinct states to one, which is Landauer 1961's own example of an erasure. So the negation is
/// free and the *annihilation* is what pays; those two are easily read as one operation, and they are not.
