/// raw controls, but slow guys like me and you, Otto, play META control schemes — where we control
/// automated liveness loops with multi-objective optimization with the controller, and WATCH").
///
/// Two tiers, one grammar:
/// - **RAW** — direct inputs (ControlScheme: pad/wasd/dpad → grammar actions). The son's tier; the
///   road, hand on the wheel.
/// - **META** — the controller adjusts the OBJECTIVE WEIGHTS of an automated liveness loop (the
///   wheel/policy plays the raw tier at machine speed; you nudge what it CARES about and watch). The
///   monorail tier: you choose destinations and priorities; the loop does the driving. Multi-objective
///   optimization with a dpad — and "watch" is first-class (the presence throttle paces the SHOW, the
///   loop keeps machine speed underneath).
///
/// Deterministic throughout: weights are clamped milli-units (no floats drifting under your thumb),
/// nudges replay, and the example policy is exact integer physics over Chip9Phys — so a meta-played
/// match is as replayable as a raw one (the recording is just SLOWER-CHANGING crossings: weight
/// nudges instead of every paddle twitch — meta control is ALSO a compression).
