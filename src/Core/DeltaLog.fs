/// producer read (clock/RNG/external) so replay is deterministic (DST §7).
///
/// `Captured` is empty when the producer was pure. Keys are caller-chosen names

/// model: one clone writes its shard), so ordering is a local total order.

/// recovery folds through the deterministic dataflow after restoring a snapshot.

///     for free), branches = relativistic frames/shards, Z-set **retraction** =
