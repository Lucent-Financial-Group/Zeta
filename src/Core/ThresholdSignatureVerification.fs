/// **Threshold signature verification — derivation A of an N-version clean-room build.**
///
/// Answers one question: *from the perspective of ONE verifying party, did at least `Threshold`
/// distinct signers on THAT party's roster produce a cryptographically valid signature over this
/// request's scope and payload, under a signature scheme that party currently accepts?*
///
/// The verdict is a value that explains itself: every submission that did **not** count says why,
/// in a discriminated union a caller can `match` on. Nothing secret ever enters a verdict — only
/// signer identities, scheme identifiers and counts.
///
/// **Purity.** `verify` is a total function of `(schemes, policy, request, epoch)`. No wall clock
/// (the migration window is compared against a caller-supplied *logical epoch*), no I/O, no global
/// mutable state, no ambient configuration. Repeated invocation, and any permutation of the
/// submission list or roster insertion order, produce a structurally identical verdict.
///
/// **The algorithm is a port, not a choice** (`ISignatureScheme`). No function in this module names
/// a concrete algorithm; the caller supplies the implementations it is willing to run. Two
/// implementations ship in `Schemes`: a platform ECDSA one and an explicitly-`toy` test double.
///
/// Anchors (Beacon): Desmedt & Frankel, *Threshold cryptosystems* (CRYPTO '89) — the k-of-n
/// authorization shape; Shamir, *How to share a secret* (CACM 1979) — the threshold idea itself;
/// Douceur, *The Sybil Attack* (2002) — why an off-roster identity must never contribute to a
/// count; Goguen & Meseguer (1982) noninterference — why the clock is a parameter and not ambient.
/// Note this module verifies a **multi-signature over a shared roster** (n independent signatures,
/// k required), *not* a single aggregated threshold signature; that distinction is deliberate — see
/// the derivation report.
