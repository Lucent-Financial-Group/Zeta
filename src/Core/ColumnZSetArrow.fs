/// **`ColumnZSet` ⇄ Apache Arrow.** The columnar Z-set and an Arrow
/// `RecordBatch` of two `Int64Array` columns are the *same physical layout* —
/// two contiguous, 8-byte-aligned `int64` runs — so this bridge is a buffer
/// handoff, not a transform.
///
/// ## How this differs from `ArrowSerializer.fs`
///
/// `ArrowInt64Serializer` converts the **row** store, and so must walk the
/// AoS entries one at a time through `Int64Array.Builder().Append(...)`,
/// paying a per-element call and a growable staging buffer to *rebuild*
/// column-major order Arrow could have consumed directly. That is the AoS tax,
/// and it is the same tax `ZSet.weightedCount` pays. Here the columns already
/// exist, so writing is `MemoryMarshal.AsBytes` over each column into an
/// `ArrowBuffer`, and reading is a span copy out of `Int64Array.Values`.
/// Neither direction touches a builder.
///
/// This is the practical argument for the columnar sibling that has nothing to
/// do with SIMD: Arrow *is* a struct-of-arrays format, so a row store can
/// never hand it a buffer — it can only re-encode into one.
///
/// ## What the Arrow round-trip does and does not prove
///
/// **It is a round-trip check, not a cross-implementation one.** Both
/// directions here call the same `Apache.Arrow` 23.0.0 .NET library, so a
/// green round-trip shows this code uses that library self-consistently and
/// shows *nothing* about whether the bytes are readable by pyarrow, arrow-rs,
/// or arrow-cpp. Agreement between two calls into one library is agreement
/// between perfectly correlated implementations, which is not evidence. The
/// same caveat already applies to `golden-vectors-arrow.json`, whose F# and C#
/// sides are also both .NET.
///
/// Making it a genuine cross-implementation check needs a vector produced by
/// something that is not this library — pyarrow or arrow-rs writing the IPC
/// bytes, checked in hex-in-JSON per the no-binary-in-the-proof-lineage rule.
/// That is a real task with a real dependency (a Python or Rust toolchain in
/// CI) and it is **not** done here; this header is the honest statement of the
/// gap rather than a claim that it is closed.
///
/// Register: `unmetered`. Correct and round-trip tested; no benchmark compares
/// it against `ArrowInt64Serializer`, and no cross-language vector exists.
///
/// Anchors (Beacon): the Apache Arrow columnar format specification (in-memory
/// layout + IPC streaming format); Boncz, Zukowski & Nes, *MonetDB/X100*
/// (CIDR 2005) for why the batch is the unit.
