/// **Temporal Coordination Detection — foundational primitives.**
///
/// This module hosts the single-node-shippable detection primitives
/// from Aaron's *differentiable firefly network + trivial cartel
/// detect* design, as formalized by Amara in the 11th courier
/// ferry (`docs/aurora/2026-04-24-amara-temporal-coordination-
/// detection-cartel-graph-influence-surface-11th-ferry.md`). Full
/// multi-node architecture awaits Zeta's multi-node foundation;
/// these pure-function primitives ship incrementally per the
/// Otto-105 graduation-cadence.
///
/// **Attribution.** The underlying concepts (temporal-coordination
/// detection as a primary defence surface, the firefly-synchronization
/// metaphor, trivial-cartel-detect as the first-order-signal tier)
/// are Aaron's design. Amara's contribution is the technical
/// vocabulary and specific formulations (phase-locking value, cross-
/// correlation, modularity spikes, eigenvector centrality drift, …).
/// This module implements Amara's formalizations; the design intent
/// behind them is Aaron's.
///
/// **Scope of this first graduation.** Only `crossCorrelation` and
/// `crossCorrelationProfile` ship here — the single most portable
/// primitive for detecting timing coordination between two event
/// streams. Downstream primitives (phase-locking value, burst-
/// alignment clusters, modularity-spike detectors, eigenvector-
/// centrality drift) are separate graduation candidates that
/// compose over this one.
///
/// **Why it matters for cartel detection.** Honest distributed
/// actors produce noisy, partially-independent event streams;
/// coordinated actors produce phase-aligned streams. Pearson cross-
/// correlation at lag τ quantifies how similarly two series move
/// at a time offset, yielding the core signal for the "obvious
/// coordinated timing" (trivial-cartel) case. Subtler coordination
/// requires the harder primitives added in later graduations.
