/// Work-stealing variant of `DbspRuntime`. Instead of pinning one shard
/// to one thread, we use `TPL Dataflow ActionBlock` which under the hood
/// uses the `ThreadPool`'s work-stealing queues. Shards can migrate
/// between threads based on load, which wins when one shard has much
/// heavier work than others.
///
/// Performance trade-off vs the pinned runtime:
///   - Pinned (`DbspRuntime`): zero-migration cost, perfect cache locality,
///     linear scaling on balanced workloads.
///   - Work-stealing (this): migration pays a cache-miss cost but wins on
///     skewed workloads where a few shards dominate.
///
/// A DI seam (`WorkerFactory`) lets callers plug in any scheduler —
/// `Task.Run`, `TaskFactory` with a custom `TaskScheduler`, or a
/// `ConcurrentExclusiveSchedulerPair` for per-shard ordering guarantees.
