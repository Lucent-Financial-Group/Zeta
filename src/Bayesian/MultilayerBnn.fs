/// **MultilayerBnn — an N-layer Bayesian network over a chain of Gaussian latents.**
///
/// ## The model, stated explicitly
///
/// One latent variable `x_i` per layer. Three kinds of factor:
///
///   * `prior_i`   — the layer prior `N(x_i ; priors.[i])`;
///   * `data`      — the observation stream, absorbed at layer 0 with variance
///                   `ObservationVariances.[0]`;
///   * `channel_i` — for `i >= 1`, the link `N(s_i ; x_i, ObservationVariances.[i])`,
///                   where `s_i = x_(i-1)` under `Sequential` and
///                   `s_i = x_(i-1) + (sum of the skip sources)` under `SkipConnections`.
///
/// Under `Sequential` that is a chain, hence a tree, so sum-product is EXACT:
/// one forward sweep plus one backward sweep yields the exact marginals. That
/// two-pass schedule is the Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother in factor-graph
/// clothing (Rauch, Tung and Striebel 1965; Kalman 1960).
///
/// ## What this revision fixed
///
/// The inter-layer hand-off used to be a POINT ESTIMATE: layer `i` received
/// `Gaussian.mean posterior_(i-1)` as a scalar observation and every layer
/// accumulated it into its own likelihood product. Three defects followed from
/// that single choice.
///
///   1. **The variance of the layer below was discarded.** Output precision was
///      depth-INVARIANT (11.0 at every depth in the reproduction) while the mean
///      attenuated geometrically, so a deep agent published a confidently wrong
///      answer — and confidence is the only channel the society reads.
///   2. **The advertised EP cavity was an algebraic identity.** A layer holds
///      only `prior x likelihood`, so `posterior / likelihood` is identically the
///      prior and `(P - L) + L = P`; the backward pass provably did nothing.
///   3. **Messages were accumulated rather than replaced,** so one observation
///      was counted once per layer.
///
/// The fix is to carry a MESSAGE instead of a number. A belief crossing a noisy
/// link keeps its mean and gains the link variance (`throughChannel`); a skip
/// junction sums by convolution (`convolve`); and each sweep RECOMPUTES the
/// up/down messages instead of multiplying fresh copies in. Only layer 0
/// accumulates evidence, because only layer 0 sees data.
///
/// The cavity is now real: the message from `x_(i-1)` to `x_i` is the belief at
/// layer `i-1` with the message layer `i` sent DOWN divided out — the
/// sum-product variable rule, which is exactly the EP cavity (Minka 2001).
/// Dividing it out is also what makes both sweeps idempotent (discipline #6).
///
/// ## What this revision did NOT fix, deliberately
///
/// Depth still attenuates the posterior mean. That is now a property of the
/// STATED MODEL rather than of the arithmetic: every layer carries its own
/// proper prior, so every hop shrinks the mean toward that prior while the
/// channel adds variance. With near-flat deeper priors the same code preserves
/// the mean and grows the variance instead. Choosing the per-layer prior is a
/// modelling decision for the caller, and an agent whose interval fails to
/// cover the truth must be refused by a calibration gate rather than silently
/// summed into a society.
///
/// ## Honest scope boundary
///
/// Under `SkipConnections` the graph is loopy: the forward sweep carries skip
/// evidence but the backward sweep sends downward messages only along the
/// sequential links, so the result is a first-order approximation rather than
/// the exact marginal. `FactorGraph.runToFixpointDamped` is the upgrade path.
///
/// Anchors: Kalman 1960; Rauch, Tung and Striebel 1965 (the two-pass smoother);
/// Kschischang, Frey and Loeliger 2001 (sum-product); Loeliger 2004 (the
/// Gaussian message tables for the sum and channel factors); Minka 2001 (EP,
/// and the reason a fully conjugate site has nothing left to refine).
