/// **`ThousandBrains` — finite multi-observer prototype.**
///
/// This module provides scalar and frame-tagged Gaussian observer records plus an
/// explicit weighted query. It is inspired by selected computational interfaces
/// proposed in Thousand Brains material—partial observations, reference frames, and
/// lateral agreement—but it does **not** implement cortical columns, sensorimotor
/// learning, object models, human cognition, or intelligence.
///
/// The correspondence is deliberately partial:
/// 1. `Column` and `SpatialColumn` are software records, not biological columns.
/// 2. `computeConsensus` and `spatialConsensus` are deterministic weighted-Gaussian
///    queries, not EP, neural signaling, or replicated CRDT state merges.
/// 3. Frame tags refuse a mixed-frame pool; they do not derive object-relative
///    locations, movement, orientation, or spatial meaning.
/// 4. `InformationValue` supplies an existing numeric query weight only; it is not a
///    measured learning currency or a biological mechanism.
///
/// The exposed operations retain finite numerical tests. A separate capability matrix
/// records the absent movement-conditioned prediction, object learning, and transfer
/// interfaces; no regularization or information-recovery claim is made here.
