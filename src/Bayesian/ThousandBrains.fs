/// **`ThousandBrains` — Writer-Actor-Routing Model.**
///
/// Implements the Thousand Brains theory of intelligence (Hawkins) using Zeta's 
/// Bayesian primitives. 
///
/// The core idea: intelligence is not a single hierarchical model, but thousands of 
/// independent "columns" (agents/models) that observe the world, maintain their own 
/// beliefs, and vote on the identity of objects.
///
/// In Zeta, this maps perfectly to the `LocalConsensus` and `InformationValue` primitives:
/// 1. **Columns** are independent Gaussian priors (discrete-ticking observers).
/// 2. **Voting** is lateral EP message passing between columns.
/// 3. **Consensus** is the joint posterior exceeding a precision threshold.
/// 4. **Currency** is Information Value (IV) — columns weight their votes by how much IV they gained.
///
/// This architecture recovers the continuous information lost by individual discrete
/// ticks (the -1/12 Zeta regularization penalty) through decorrelated lateral consensus.
