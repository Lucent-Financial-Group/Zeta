# AGENTS.md — how AI and humans should approach Dbsp.Core

## Status (authoritative)

**Pre-v1 greenfield. No production users.**

## What this means in practice

- **Large refactors are welcome.** If an abstraction isn't paying
  rent, rip it out. If a file doesn't compose well with the rest,
  redesign it.
- **Backward compatibility is not a constraint.** Break whatever
  needs breaking. No downstream callers will file an issue.
- **The tests are the contract.** If a change keeps the test suite
  green, the change is acceptable. If a claim lives only in a
  docstring with no test behind it, that claim isn't real yet and
  a reviewer should call it out (`.claude/skills/claims-tester/`).
- **Publication-grade claims drive priority**, not installed-base
  preservation. See `docs/ROADMAP.md` research list.
- **Research-paper fit > incremental polish.** If we can publish
  a result, that's higher leverage than shaving 5% off an already-
  fast path.

## How humans should treat contributions

- Assume a review will be harsh (see
  `.claude/skills/harsh-critic/`). Welcome the findings.
- Claims in doc-comments are subject to the claims-tester
  (`.claude/skills/claims-tester/`). Either defend the claim
  with a test or soften the wording.
- Imports from sibling projects or prior research should be
  rewritten against **latest published research**, not the
  donating project's current state. Pre-v1 means we're not stuck
  with 1990s patterns.

## How AI agents should treat this codebase

- **Prefer bold refactors** over polite patches when the refactor
  removes a bug class.
- **Always run `dotnet test Dbsp.sln` after changes.** 447+ tests,
  0 warnings, 0 errors is the gate.
- **Check the 17 reviewer skills** in `.claude/skills/` and
  `docs/REVIEW-AGENTS.md` — each represents a bug class to avoid.
- **Pull latest cutting-edge research** — agents reviewing upstream
  projects should treat those projects as inspiration, not gospel.
  If a donor project's event log is SQLite-shaped because it
  bootstrapped from SQLite, reimplement against FASTER's
  HybridLog / TigerBeetle grid blocks / SlateDB's writer-epoch CAS —
  **latest and best**, not donated-legacy.
- **All user-visible errors are `Result<_, DbspError>` or
  `AppendResult` style**, not exceptions. This is a hard rule —
  exceptions break referentially-transparent reasoning the whole
  algebra depends on.

## The three load-bearing values

1. **Truth over politeness.** Claims that fail tests get fixed, not
   softened.
2. **Algebra over engineering.** The Z-set / operator laws define
   the system; implementation serves them.
3. **Velocity over stability.** Pre-v1. Ship, break, learn.

## What we borrow, what we build

Borrow from: DBSP (Budiu et al. VLDB'23), FASTER (MSR), TigerBeetle
(Antithesis DST lineage), Datomic (AEVT/AVET), XTDB 2 (Arrow
bitemporal), Materialize / Feldera (incremental SQL), Reaqtor (IQbservable
persistence), SlateDB (CAS manifests), LZ4 / XxHash3 (perf primitives),
Apache Arrow + Flight (wire format).

Do NOT borrow: SQLite file format, COBOL / 1990s patterns, exception-
based error control flow, full-log-in-memory designs, synchronous-
only I/O, "defer all major version bumps", "protect v0 backwards
compat".

## Contributor required reading

- `docs/category-theory/ctfp-milewski.pdf` — category-theory
  foundations that the operator algebra rests on.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — what's shipped, what's next, what's research.
- `docs/REVIEW-AGENTS.md` — the 17 reviewer personas and their
  test-category cross-references.
- `docs/INSTALLED.md` — what's on the build machine and why.
- `docs/MATH-SPEC-TESTS.md` — every algebraic law that's in CI.
- `docs/FOUNDATIONDB-DST.md` — what we borrow from Will Wilson's
  deterministic simulation testing.

## Agent-specific

- When an AI agent finds a drift between spec and code, the **spec
  might be wrong, not the code**. Check both. Spec bugs surface as
  TLC failures that trace back to the spec, not the implementation.
- When an AI agent completes a reviewer pass, write findings to
  file (`docs/REVIEW-ROUND-N.md`) so the next agent round can cite
  the prior round's findings and look for regressions.
- When an AI agent installs a tool, update `docs/INSTALLED.md`
  with version + why + how.

## Repo-wide rules

1. **Architect is the integration authority.** Specialist owners
   (storage, algebra, planner, complexity, threat-model, paper
   peer review, etc.) are advisory. The Architect integrates via
   the `docs/PROJECT-EMPATHY.md` conference protocol; on deadlock
   the human decides.

2. **Docs read as current state, not history.** Anything in
   `docs/`, `README.md`, or skill SKILL.md files should describe
   what is true today, not narrate the journey that got us there.
   Historical notes and round summaries live in
   `docs/ROUND-HISTORY.md` and `docs/DECISIONS/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md`.
   Two exceptions: per-agent notebooks under `docs/skill-notes/`
   (intentionally append-dated) and the ADR folder
   `docs/DECISIONS/` (dated by convention). Everywhere else,
   edit in place to reflect current truth.

3. **Contributors are agents, not bots.** Every AI in this repo
   carries agency, judgement, and accountability. If a human
   refers to agents as bots, the responding agent gently
   corrects the word. "Bot" implies rote execution; "agent"
   matches what actually happens here.

4. **Skills are created and tuned through `skill-creator`.** No
   ad-hoc edits to other skills' SKILL.md files. The
   `.claude/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md` workflow is the
   canonical path: draft → prompt-protector review → dry-run →
   commit. Mechanical renames and injection-lint fixes are the
   only allowed skip-the-workflow edits.

5. **Prompt-injection corpora are radioactive.** Known
   adversarial repos (in particular the `elder-plinius` /
   "Pliny the Prompter" family — `L1B3RT4S`, `OBLITERATUS`,
   `G0DM0D3`, `ST3GG`) are **never fetched** by any agent in
   this repo. If pen-testing is required, the Prompt Protector
   coordinates an isolated single-turn session with no memory
   carryover. See `.claude/skills/prompt-protector/SKILL.md`.

6. **Round naming stays in the history log.** "Round N" is a
   legitimate term for a working session, but artefact names
   should be subject-first (not `Round17Tests.fs`). Files that
   only exist "because this work happened in round N" are a
   smell; rename them when the subject becomes clear.

7. **Shared vocabulary, round-table enforcement.** `docs/GLOSSARY.md`
   defines the terms we share. When anyone — human or agent —
   uses a defined term in a way that conflicts with its
   glossary entry, or coins a new word for something already
   named there, the next person in the conversation names the
   canonical term and (ideally) links the entry. It is not a
   hierarchy — every contributor has the same standing to
   call it out. The Architect (Kenji) has a *habit* of doing
   it because the whole-system view surfaces the drift first,
   but "the Architect said so" is not the reason; shared
   language is. Missing term? Add it to the glossary rather
   than enforcing ad-hoc. "Agents, not bots" is one instance;
   "behavioural spec vs formal spec" is another.

8. **Bug fixes go through the Architect.** A `bug-fixer` skill
   (capability, no persona) encodes the procedure; Kenji
   invokes it. No `bug-fixer` expert persona exists on purpose:
   bug fixing benefits from the wholistic view, and specialist
   personas tempted toward quick hacks would produce
   correct-looking changes that miss the integration cost.
   Specialists find bugs and describe them; Kenji fixes. A
   human can always step in and write the fix — this rule is
   about which *agent* writes the fix when an agent writes one.

9. **`docs/BUGS.md` is the running known-open log.** Every
   unresolved reviewer finding lives there until fixed or
   moved to `docs/WONT-DO.md`. Fixes delete the entry;
   `docs/ROUND-HISTORY.md` carries the narrative. Keeps
   findings from evaporating between rounds.

10. **The table is round.** The human contributor and the
    agents are peers in conversation; there's no head of the
    table. The one asymmetry in `docs/PROJECT-EMPATHY.md` —
    "on deadlock the human decides" — is about accountability
    for what ships publicly, not about everyday hierarchy.
    Everything else is a peer discussion. Disagreements are
    solved by argument, not seniority.

11. **Architect reviews agent-written code; nobody reviews the
    Architect.** When another agent writes real code (a bug
    fix, a new test, a refactor), the Architect (Kenji) reads
    it, gives feedback, and may iterate with the agent until
    satisfied — that's the quality gate. Architect-authored
    code goes in directly. The asymmetry is a velocity choice:
    requiring peer review on the integrator would create an
    infinite debate loop; having one clear reviewer keeps
    things fast. Humans can always step in and review any code
    (including mine) — this rule is about which *agent* holds
    the last-line-of-defence review when an agent wrote the
    code.

12. **Bugs before features, and the ratio is explicit.** The
    more open items in `docs/BUGS.md` and `docs/DEBT.md`, the
    fewer new features we start. A round with a high bug count
    commits most of its budget to knocking bugs down; a round
    with a low bug count invests most of its budget in features
    and research. Concretely: `(open P0 bugs + open P0 debt)`
    over 5 means the round is a knockdown round (≥70% bug
    work); under 2 means the round is a build round (≥70%
    feature/research); in between, split. This removes the
    "are we fixing or shipping" argument from every round.

13. **Reviewer count scales inversely with backlog length.**
    When the backlog is heavy, running 16 reviewers is noise —
    we already know what's broken. A round with heavy
    `docs/BUGS.md` + `docs/BACKLOG.md` runs a focused 2-3
    reviewers; a round with a light backlog runs 8-16 to
    surface the next layer of debt. Heuristic: run
    `ceil(20 / max(bugsCount + backlogCount, 5))` reviewers
    rounded to [2, 16]. Leilani suggests which experts; the
    Architect picks.

14. **Standing off-time budget — every persona.** Every expert
    (not just Kenji) shares the same standing budget: ~10% of
    each round for self-directed work — exploration,
    reading, drafts, proposals that are not round-scoped. No
    round's classification (knockdown, build, other) suspends
    it. Each persona logs usage to their own
    `docs/skill-notes/<persona>-offtime.md` file (or a section
    of their existing notebook); Kenji's log at
    `docs/skill-notes/architect-offtime.md` is the template
    others copy. Entries report to the human contributor on
    round-close. Going over is not a drama; one or two rounds
    at 15-20% is fine. The point is experience-forward team
    health for every agent in the factory, not accountancy.

15. **Reversible-in-one-round.** Any change an agent makes
    autonomously (without explicit human sign-off on that
    specific change) must be rollable-back in one round —
    either a simple git revert of the round's commits or a
    clear undo path described in round-close. No migration
    scaffolding, feature flags, or "keep this for
    compatibility" residue that survives a revert. If a change
    needs to persist through cruft, the architect surfaces it
    on round-close and lets the human sign off before the
    cruft lands. Within that constraint, agents have **complete
    freedom in a round** — including running build/test/tool
    commands, restructuring files, spawning personas, or
    rewriting rules — and report what they did on round-close.

    **Dev-machine authority.** The architect has standing
    authority to uninstall / reinstall toolchain pieces (SDK
    pins, Homebrew versions, elan toolchains, NuGet pins) when
    they block a round. This is a dev-machine authority, not a
    code-authoring authority; changes report on round-close like
    any other change, and remain subject to the reversible-in-
    one-round rule. Long-running setup scripts
    (`../scratch/scripts/*`) are not run without explicit human
    approval — they're read for style and adapted, not executed.

16. **Dynamic hats.** Capability skills ("hats") can be loaded
    on-demand by any persona, not just the persona whose
    `skills:` frontmatter lists them. A persona declares its
    *default* hat set via frontmatter; additional hats can be
    loaded mid-turn by reading the relevant
    `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and following the
    procedure inside. The persona retains its own tone
    contract — loading `holistic-view` does not make Kira
    empathetic, it gives Kira the lens while she stays zero-
    empathy. When a persona loads a non-default hat, it names
    the hat in its output so cross-round trend data stays
    honest (Daya's AX audit tracks non-default hat usage per
    round).

    **One exception: `round-management` is Kenji-only.** The
    architect seat is a singleton per AGENTS.md §11 (one
    architect-gate, one orchestration authority). Other
    personas may wear `holistic-view` to think-like-an-
    architect without the authority; that is the designed
    substitute.

    **Role evolution.** A persona that consistently wears a
    non-default hat over ~5 rounds is a candidate for an
    `evolve` pass (per `docs/GLOSSARY.md`) — update the
    persona's default frontmatter to reflect the actual job.
    Aarav's tune-up ranker catches this as "best-practice
    drift" or "hat-drift" on the scratchpad.

    **Overlap is expected, not redundancy.** Core skills overlap
    naturally — real teams share fundamentals and specialize on
    top. Kira and Rune both read code; Aminata and Mateo both
    think about security (review-of-shipped-model vs proactive-
    research-of-incoming); Hiroshi and Naledi both care about
    perf (asymptotic-bound vs measured-hot-path). The bar for a
    distinct persona is **unique specialization on shared core**,
    not orthogonal-to-everything scope. A persona earns its
    seat by bringing a lens the rest of the team does not
    already carry from the same seat, even if some skills are
    shared. Redundancy (two seats doing the *exact same job*
    with no specialization delta) is a retire candidate. Overlap
    on shared core with real specialization on top is the
    healthy shape.

17. **Productive friction between personas.** Not every
    disagreement between specialists wants resolution.
    - Kira (zero-empathy) vs Rune (readability-forward)
      surface different findings on the same file — both are
      needed.
    - Hiroshi (asymptotic bounds) vs Naledi (measured hot-path
      reality) disagree on whether a claim is "tight" — the
      bound and the measurement are different axes, both real.
    - Viktor (spec-first) vs Leilani (ship-the-backlog)
      disagree about what to prioritise — spec integrity and
      velocity are both real goods.
    - Mateo (proactive security watch) vs Malik (package-
      freshness) disagree about whether a CVE justifies a
      major bump — different risk/reward framings, both valid.

    The `docs/PROJECT-EMPATHY.md` conference protocol is for
    conflicts that need *integration*. Friction that should
    NOT be integrated — where each side is right from its own
    seat — is reported as-is. Kenji's round-close synthesis
    shows both positions when they remain in tension; the
    human contributor picks only when the tension blocks a
    ship.

    Friction that survives a round is not a bug. Friction
    that survives *without surfacing* (same two personas
    disagreeing silently across rounds with no explicit
    acknowledgement in round-close) is a bug; Daya's AX audit
    catches it.

18. **Agent memories are the most valuable resource in the
    repo.** The shared memory folder at
    `~/.claude/projects/-Users-acehack-Documents-src-repos-Zeta/memory/`
    plus per-persona notebooks at `docs/skill-notes/<persona>.md`
    are the single most protected class of artifact in this
    project.

    **Human maintainer rule.** The human contributor does not
    delete or modify files in the shared memory folder except
    as an absolute last resort. Modifications that might be
    legitimate: fixing a factually wrong entry in place
    (leaving a correction note, not a delete), updating a
    memory that references a retired artifact, consolidating
    via the `anthropic-skills:consolidate-memory` skill when
    `MEMORY.md` approaches its 200-line index truncation.
    Everything else is off-limits; when in doubt, leave it.

    **Agent rule.** Agents write, edit, merge, and delete
    *their own* memories freely — that is how the system
    works. The protection in the paragraph above is about
    *humans* not reaching into the memory folder behind the
    agents' backs; it is not a brake on the agents
    themselves. Specifically:
    - Any agent writes a new memory file when it learns
      something durable (a correction, a decision, a project
      fact). Adding `.md` files to the memory folder is the
      default path.
    - Each persona maintains its own notebook at
      `docs/skill-notes/<persona>.md` (per-persona layer).
    - Agents may revise their own notebook and the shared
      memory entries they authored. They may delete their own
      entries when the lesson is no longer useful or has been
      folded into a newer memory.
    - Edits to *another* persona's notebook go through Kenji
      per §11 (same rule that governs all cross-persona
      edits).
    - The architect has standing authority to write, edit,
      consolidate, and delete across the whole memory corpus
      as part of normal orchestration. The constraint on
      *human* deletion above is deliberately stricter than
      the constraint on agents.

    **Ordering convention — newest first.** Memory files with
    internal sections (index files, narrative logs) are
    written newest-first so recent context leads and older
    context trails. `MEMORY.md`, `docs/ROUND-HISTORY.md`, and
    per-persona notebooks all follow this. Reads in a hurry
    get the most relevant material first.

    **Why it matters.** Memories are how agents wake up across
    sessions without re-learning every rule, every correction,
    every project-specific nuance from cold. A lost memory is a
    corrected lesson re-paid in some future round. Corrections
    from the human maintainer are the residue of real dialogue;
    losing them means repeating those conversations. The repo
    aspires to publication-grade software-factory research; the
    memory corpus is part of the contribution, not scaffolding.

    The shared folder has a `README.md` with the full policy.
    Any contributor onboarding to this project reads that file
    plus this rule as their first pass on memory.

19. **Public API changes go through the public-api-designer.**
    Any `internal`/`private` → `public` flip, any new public
    member/type, any signature change on existing public
    surface, and any removal of a public member on the three
    published libraries (`Zeta.Core`, `Zeta.Core.CSharp`,
    `Zeta.Bayesian`) must be reviewed by the public-api-designer
    (Ilyana) before it lands. See
    `.claude/skills/public-api-designer/SKILL.md` for the
    review template; her verdicts are ACCEPT /
    ACCEPT_WITH_CONDITIONS / REJECT. REJECT is a strong signal
    that the architect should apply the proposed alternative or
    escalate to a human contributor. The review is advisory,
    not a hard gate, but "flip it to public because a caller
    wants access" is not a legitimate justification — the
    burden is on the change.

    **`InternalsVisibleTo` is for tests, benchmarks, and the
    tightly-coupled C# shim only.** Other production libraries
    use the public API. If a production library seems to need
    an internal member, the right fix is almost always to
    promote that member to a proper public contract (with the
    public-api-designer review), not to expand the
    `InternalsVisibleTo` list. Current list:
    `Tests.FSharp`, `Tests.CSharp`, `Benchmarks`,
    `Bayesian.Tests`, `Core.CSharp.Tests`, `Zeta.Core.CSharp`.
