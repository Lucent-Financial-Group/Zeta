/// Micro-benchmarks for `Zeta.Core.BloomFilter`.
///
/// Covered surfaces:
///   * `BlockedBloomFilter.Add` / `.MayContain` throughput at
///     n = 10k, 100k, 1M, for int64 and string keys.
///   * `CountingBloomFilter.Add` / `.Remove` / `.MayContain`
///     throughput, insert-only and mixed 50/50 insert/remove.
///   * Empirical false-positive rate of `BlockedBloomFilter` at
///     target p = 0.01 for n = 10k and n = 100k — compares the
///     analytically predicted FPR against the measured rate on a
///     disjoint probe set.
///
/// All benchmarks pre-compute the key arrays in `[<GlobalSetup>]`
/// so hashing and set construction costs are isolated from I/O
/// or random-number overhead.
