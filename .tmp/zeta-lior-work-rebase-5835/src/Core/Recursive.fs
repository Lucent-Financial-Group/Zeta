    ///    output weights become meaningless (neither a derivation count
    ///    nor a boolean indicator) and retraction correctness is lost.

    ///    eventually become empty for convergence. For transitive closure
    ///    over an acyclic edge set this holds — paths are finite. Over a
    ///    **cyclic** edge set the derivation count of a cycle-touching
    ///    tuple is unbounded (infinitely many walks traverse the cycle)
    ///    and this combinator does not terminate. Use `Recursive` there.
    ///
    /// ## Known limitation — one-shot seed
    ///
    /// The counting-recurrence this combinator computes is correct
    /// for a **one-shot seed** (the integrated seed stabilises
    /// after tick 0) driven to a fixed point via
    /// `IterateToFixedPoint`, and for monotone (insert-only) or
    /// strictly-paired (insert+retract of same edge) delta
    /// sequences on that seed. Multi-tick seed changes mid-LFP —
    /// inserting a new seed edge while the body is still
    /// iterating, then iterating again — is **not proven** to
    /// produce `Σ body^i(seed)`-style derivation counts and is

    /// correctness beyond that is an open research question.

    ///

    /// the number of derivation trees proving `k`. Callers that want
    /// classical set-of-tuples semantics should compose a `Distinct` on
