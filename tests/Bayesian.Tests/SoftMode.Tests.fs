///
/// The end-game of the Zeta Bayesian network is an Infer.NET-style belief
/// propagation network over *dynamic/soft value* where **soft mode is a
/// structural invariant** — no agent ever collapses out of it, because the
/// network topology and the EP factor semantics together make collapse
/// impossible, not merely unlikely.
///
/// This module proves the three load-bearing properties that underpin that
/// claim:
///
/// **SM-1 (Cavity-properness preservation).**
///   If a variable's cavity is proper before a probit EP pass, it remains
///   proper after. This is the per-step invariant: `runToFixpoint` is a
///   composition of `passOnce` steps, and each step preserves properness.
///
/// **SM-2 (No Dirac-delta fixed point).**
///   A fixed point of `runToFixpoint` on a graph that contains at least one
///   proper prior and one EP probit factor cannot have zero variance (a Dirac
///   delta). The prior injects finite precision; the probit factor injects
///   additional precision; their product always has strictly positive variance.
///   Collapse to a point mass is structurally impossible.
///
/// **SM-3 (Mutual empowerment — private state influences marginal).**
///   On a two-agent graph where each agent has a private prior and they are
///   connected by an EP probit factor, the marginal of each agent depends
///   non-trivially on the other agent's prior. Changing agent B's prior
///   changes agent A's marginal — the agents are mutually empowered to keep
///   each other in soft mode. This is the computational analogue of the
///   CausalPower Z3 lemma, grounded in the concrete factor-graph substrate.
///
/// Together SM-1 + SM-2 + SM-3 constitute the **soft-mode invariant**:
/// the network is designed so that the fixed point of belief propagation is
/// always a proper Gaussian (never a Dirac delta, never uniform), and every
/// agent's beliefs are genuinely influenced by every other agent it is
/// connected to. The agents are mutually empowered to stay soft.
///
/// **Connection to the FROZEN-CORE register (docs/FROZEN-CORE-AND-CONJECTURE-REGISTER.md):**
/// The register identifies the open half of the non-collapse conjecture as
/// "dynamical stability over unbounded time — the balanced dynamics has the
/// differentiated manifold as a stable attractor (Lyapunov-stable)." SM-1
/// through SM-3 are the *per-step* and *per-fixed-point* legs of that
/// conjecture, grounded in the concrete EP/BP substrate. The unbounded-time
/// leg (Lyapunov stability over the DBSP stream) remains open and is
/// identified as the next rung.

// SM-1: Cavity-properness preservation under EP probit pass
//
// The probit factor's ComputeMessages only emits a non-uniform message
// when the incoming cavity is proper (Gaussian.isProper). When the
// cavity is improper (τ ≤ 0), the factor emits Gaussian.One (the flat
// message) — it contributes no information but also does not corrupt
// the marginal. When the cavity is proper, the projected message is
// also proper (the probit observation adds precision, never removes it).
//
// This is the per-step invariant that makes runToFixpoint safe: no
// single pass can turn a proper marginal into an improper one, because
// the factor→var messages are always either flat (improper cavity) or
// proper (proper cavity). The marginal is the product of all incoming
// messages; a product of proper Gaussians is proper.

// that on any graph containing at least one proper prior N(m, v) and one
// EP probit factor, the fixed point of runToFixpoint has strictly positive
// variance — it is never a point mass.
//
// The argument: the prior contributes precision τ_prior = 1/v > 0. The
// probit factor contributes additional precision τ_factor > 0 (it always
// adds information when the cavity is proper, as proven by SM-1a). The
// marginal precision is τ_prior + τ_factor, which is finite (both
// summands are finite). So the marginal variance = 1/(τ_prior + τ_factor)
// is strictly positive and strictly less than 1/τ_prior.
//
// The fixed point is always a proper Gaussian with finite, positive variance.
// Collapse to a Dirac delta would require τ → ∞, which requires either
// τ_prior → ∞ (the prior itself is a point mass — excluded by the
