/// Stress-test harness for concurrent code. Each helper here spawns
/// many threads, synchronises their start via a `TaskCompletionSource`
/// gate, hammers shared state, and then checks invariants.
///
/// ## How this catches missing `Interlocked.CompareExchange`
///
/// A plain `state <- state + 1` on a multi-threaded path produces
/// **lost updates** (two threads read the same value, both write
/// `read + 1`, one update is gone). If the harness runs N threads
/// each calling the operation M times and the resulting counter is
/// less than N × M, we caught the bug. Specifically:
///   - `Circuit.tick` — if N tick callers race and we just do
///     `tick <- tick + 1L`, final tick < N · M.
///   - `FeedbackOp.Connect` — two threads both see `connected = 0`,
///     both write `source`, exactly-one-caller invariant broken.
///   - `HasAsyncOps` iterating `ops` unguarded — invalid-index reads
///     surface as exceptions.
///
/// ## Why we don't just rely on TLA+
///
/// TLA+ proves the invariant at the *model* level; this harness
/// exercises the **real compiled code** under the real CLR memory
/// model. When the two agree, you're covered at both levels — if
/// they disagree, the harness flags the regression at CI time.
///
/// See also `VirtualTimeScheduler` for deterministic async tests
/// inspired by Rx's `TestScheduler` — that harness replaces wall-
/// clock with a manual clock you step, so a "5-second delay + async
/// publish" becomes a single `scheduler.AdvanceBy(5_000)` call.


/// Run `action` on `threadCount` threads, each invoking `iterations`
/// times, with a barrier that releases all threads simultaneously.
/// Returns the total elapsed milliseconds.
