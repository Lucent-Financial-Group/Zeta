// weight. (A retraction that overshoots — removing an edge more times
// than it was inserted — is a legitimate way for Z-weights to go
// negative, but we paper over that by generating only insert-retract
// pairs where each retraction is matched by a prior insert.)


// Small acyclic-edge generator. Edges `(u, v)` with `u < v` on nodes
// `{0..7}`, generated as a list of positive inserts. The FsCheck
// property then replays the inserts, applies a retraction of a
// random **sub-multiset** of those edges, and asserts the resulting
// closure's weights are all ≥ 0.
