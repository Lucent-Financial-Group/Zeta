// ── the third boundary: ZERO is absorbing, so the fold is not cancellative ──────────────────────
//
// `observe` is a commutative monoid under pointwise multiplication, and that monoid has ABSORBING
// elements: a likelihood weight of 0 annihilates its candidate, and 0 has no inverse. So a
// candidate zeroed by one observation cannot be restored by any later evidence — the fold is not
// cancellative, and the loss is PERMANENT rather than merely order-dependent.
//
// Why that is the interesting case for delay: everywhere else, delay is inert on this fold —
// divergence heals exactly, because commutativity makes the merge path-independent. The absorbing
// zero is the ONE place where a delayed replica can differentiate PERMANENTLY, and it does so by
// destroying information rather than by carrying any. That is bug-shaped, not feature-shaped: it
// is the absorbing/irreversible state, not the differentiation the trajectory is after.
//
// REACHABILITY, stated because a mechanism is not a severity (checked 2026-08-10):
//   * `BeliefConvergence` has NO non-test callers in `src/` — the only reference is a docstring
//     cross-reference in `SymmetricEndurance.fs`. Nothing in production folds beliefs today, so
//     this is not currently exploitable. Recorded so the claim is not inflated.
//   * Zero likelihoods ARE already generated: `genVec` is `Gen.choose (0, 10)`, which includes 0.
//     The existing commutativity / associativity / order-independence properties pass anyway,
//     because zero is absorbing SYMMETRICALLY — order-independence survives information loss.
//     That is the point worth keeping: those green properties are not evidence of recoverability.
//
// The repo's own fix is already named — additive log-space with retraction is a GROUP (invertible),
// where the corresponding failure cannot occur. Pinned here so the property is in place before any
// caller arrives, rather than discovered by one.

// Therefore the uniform distribution IS the MacWilliams fixed point of the accumulation operator.
// Accumulating balanced (no-evidence) likelihoods should preserve this fixed point.

// This test is the NUMERICAL FALSIFIER for the bridge. If it passes, the conjecture survives.

// Aaron's conjecture (2026-07-04): the orbit-map intertwining gap closes when
// distributions are constrained to the soft manifold (orbit-symmetric, non-collapsed).
//
// THEOREM (proven numerically, 2026-07-04):
//   For orbit-symmetric distributions a, b over the 16 Adinkra codewords:
//     π(a .* b) ∝ (π(a) .* π(b)) / W_C
//   where W_C = [1, 0, 0, 0, 14, 0, 0, 0, 1] is the MacWilliams fixed point.
//
// The denominator W_C IS the self-dual fixed point — the code's weight distribution
// divides out the orbit-counting factor, making the intertwining exact.
//
// "Staying soft" = orbit-symmetric = invariant under the [8,4] automorphism group.
// "Not collapsing the wave function" = all weight classes have positive mass.
