// Work-item 081M0X49HBD087G0R001HM9VHF. Each test is written so that a stubbed or
// convenient implementation FAILS it; mutation results are recorded in the PR body.
//
// THE LINE (outcome record, never inner state)
//   DSL-1   declare refuses an observer attributing a stance to a counterparty
//   DSL-2   declare accepts a self-declaration
//   DSL-3   the subject check is ORDINAL: "Aaron" vs "aaron" is an observer attribution
//   DSL-4   a declaration at the same logical phase as the result is refused (boundary)
//   DSL-5   a declaration after the result is refused (an excuse, not a disclosure)
//   DSL-6   empty subject / empty domain refused
//   DSL-37  no hidden clock: every Declaration field equals the argument it was given
//
// THE RECIPROCAL OBLIGATION
//   DSL-7   openExchange refuses a domain mismatch
//   DSL-8   openExchange refuses a self-exchange (no self-manufactured confirmation)
//   DSL-9   a two-sided exchange opens
//
// THE OUTCOME RECORD
//   DSL-10  a fresh cell's holdRate is 0.5 (honest prior, not 0)
//   DSL-11  a held-up claim raises the cell's holdRate
//   DSL-12  a failed claim lowers it
//   DSL-13  stance isolation: outcomes under Eager do not move the Neutral cell
//   DSL-14  domain isolation
//   DSL-15  party isolation
//   DSL-16  obsCount counts resolutions
//   DSL-17  beneficiaryProfile counts allocations
//   DSL-20  idempotency (#6): the same claimId twice == once
//
// DECLARATION x POSTERIOR
//   DSL-21  below the evidence floor: InsufficientEvidence, never a manufactured number
//   DSL-22  separated cells: DeclarationDiscriminates
//   DSL-23  identical cells: DeclarationCarriesNoInformation
//   DSL-29  discriminating history puts the receiver on the declared cell
//   DSL-30  non-discriminating history pools, and the declaration STILL chose the cell
//
// COUNTERPARTY USE
//   DSL-24  EAGER IS NOT A DISCOUNT: identical records under Eager / Neutral weigh identically
//   DSL-25  Kish design effect: 5 supports from ONE source at rho=1 -> 1.0 effective
//   DSL-26  rho=0 -> n_eff = n (the control: the discount is not unconditional)
//   DSL-27  2 distinct sources at rho=1 -> 2.0, and no further confirmation required
//   DSL-28  one source with 5 supports STILL requires an independent confirmation
//
// THE TAILS (declined, and the decline is enforced)
//   DSL-31  weigh is invariant to Beneficiary — fails if a selfishness penalty is wired in
//
// THE OBSERVABLE SIGNATURE OF EARLY CONVERGENCE
//   DSL-32  below the history floor: InsufficientHistory, not a manufactured trend
//   DSL-33  improving history -> MarginalYieldRising
//   DSL-34  flat history -> MarginalYieldFlat
//   DSL-35  declining history -> MarginalYieldFalling
//
// DST
//   DSL-36  the same resolution sequence replays to the same ledger
//
// CHECK-ARITY ADJUDICATION (registry/check-arity-census.json, this file = 1)
//   `audit-check-arity.ts` R2 flagged DSL-36 and DSL-37 as self-comparisons. The 2026-08-25
//   adjudication kept both on the argument that "a determinism check has no other shape".
//   HALF OF THAT WAS WRONG AND THE OTHER HALF NEEDS A STATED LIMIT.
//
//   DSL-37 -- VACUOUS, and now DELETED rather than licensed. Under a real ambient-clock
//     mutant it survived 14 of 25 runs. Detail and the mutant at the test itself. Census
//     lowered 2 -> 1 in the same commit, per R2's downward ratchet.
//
//   DSL-36 -- KEPT, with its limit written down. It is a genuine check against PER-CALL
//     ambient entropy: a clock-derived perturbation inside `record` differs between the two
//     folds and kills it. It is BLIND, deterministically and by construction, to a
//     ONCE-PER-PROCESS capture. Measured: a module-level `let private ambientEpoch =
//     int (DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks % 7L) + 1` folded into the cell left DSL-36 GREEN while
//     DSL-17 and DSL-31 -- which pin VALUES rather than compare two runs -- both failed.
//     That is the honest shape of the guarantee: same process, same answer. Cross-process
//     replay, which is what DST actually claims, is carried by the value pins, not by DSL-36.
