// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// ERASURE IS A PROPERTY OF THE REPRESENTATION — the law pack for the spine/log/eviction sites
//
// `WSet.ErasureClassification.Laws.Tests.fs` established the machinery for the four-corner
// algebra: a class DECLARED beside each operation, MEASURED by exhaustive sweep, required to agree
// in BOTH directions, with a reflection drift guard so a new operation fails rather than passes.
// This pack extends that same machinery down to the storage layer, which declared nothing.
//
// WHY IT COULD NOT BE A LIST OF OPERATION NAMES. `IDeltaLog.TruncateAsync` is ONE interface method
// with ONE call site — `RecoverableSpine.CommitAsync`. Across the backends this repo ships it has
// three different thermodynamic classes, for three unrelated reasons:
//
//   InMemoryDeltaLog        `list.RemoveAll`                      -> ERASING
//   ZetaFsDeltaLog          new commit WITH old as parent         -> REVERSIBLE (DAG); ERASING (read surface)
//   GitDeltaLog             new tree committed WITH old as parent -> REVERSIBLE
//   GroupCommitDiskDeltaLog sealed segments unlinked, active kept  -> REVERSIBLE (default cap: no roll,
//                                                                     so the identity IN THE MODEL);
//                                                                     ERASING (cap forced to 1 byte)
//
// Same name, same caller, opposite class, decided entirely by the injected backend. So the
// classification attaches to the concrete type via `IErasureDeclaring`, never to the interface —
// and the pin below (`the same interface method carries opposite classes`) fails if anyone ever
// "tidies" that away.
//
// WHY EVERY ROW NAMES AN OBSERVATION. "Is the preimage recoverable" is not a question until you
// say through what. `ZetaFsDeltaLog` is Erasing through its own read surface and Reversible
// through the commit DAG (the parent edge). Two honest rows beat one dishonest average, so
// `(Representation, Operation, Observation)` is the key.
//
// WHY `Unmeasured` IS NOT ZERO. An operation nobody has swept has an UNKNOWN cost. Recording that
// as `0` is the closed-ledger free lunch this whole thread is about — a channel that looks free
// because nothing is watching it. `ErasureClass.bitsErasedPpm` returns `None`, not `0L`, and the
// guards below refuse to let an `Unmeasured` row wear a measured row's clothes.
//
// Anchors (Beacon): Landauer 1961; Bennett 1973; Goguen-Meseguer 1982 (noninterference).
