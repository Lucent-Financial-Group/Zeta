# PR #4899: feat(infra): per-host configs control-plane + worker-gpu-01/02 (PR 3 of Addison's plan)

## PR description

## Summary

PR 3 of Addison's NixOS-AI-cluster bootstrap plan. Adds the three per-host configs that compose the shared modules from #4898.

**Base: #4898** (will rebase to main once #4898 merges).

## Files

| Host | Imports | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `control-plane` | `common` + `k3s-server` | API server + embedded etcd; auto-bootstraps ArgoCD |
| `worker-gpu-01` | `common` + `k3s-agent` + `gpu` | NVIDIA worker; joins control-plane.zeta.local:6443 |
| `worker-gpu-02` | `common` + `k3s-agent` + `gpu` | NVIDIA worker; identical shape to -01 |

Each host directory has:
- `configuration.nix` — host identity + module imports + per-host overrides
- `hardware-configuration.nix` — **placeholder stub** (replaced during real install by `nixos-generate-config --root /mnt`)
- `README.md` on control-plane — install runbook + post-install verification

`flake.nix` now exposes all four configs in `nixosConfigurations`: `installer`, `control-plane`, `worker-gpu-01`, `worker-gpu-02`.

## Hardware config placeholders

Real `hardware-configuration.nix` is generator output specific to each target machine. Placeholders ship as minimal valid stubs (`not-detected.nix` import + DHCP + ext4 by-label fileSystems) so:
- `nix flake check` passes in CI
- `nix build .#nixosConfigurations.control-plane` succeeds at evaluation
- Real install replaces them before first reboot

Each placeholder has a comment block naming the generator command.

## Test plan

- [ ] `nix flake check` passes
- [ ] `nix build .#nixosConfigurations.{control-plane,worker-gpu-01,worker-gpu-02}` succeed
- [ ] PR 4 (k8s bootstrap) can reference `services.k3s.manifests` paths cleanly

### Thread 1: infra/nixos/hosts/control-plane/README.md:27 (unresolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-25T02:36:22Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Add credential bootstrap before SSH verification**

Following this runbook verbatim on a fresh install will fail at the first verification step because `ssh zeta@control-plane` assumes remote auth is already configured, but this commit's host config leaves `users.users.zeta.openssh.authorizedKeys.keys` empty while the shared baseline uses key-only SSH and no initial password. In that state, operators cannot complete post-install verification remotely; add an explicit pre-SSH step to install a key (or set a password) before this command.
