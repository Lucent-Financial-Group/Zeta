# PR #4902: shard(2026-05-25/0243Z): 18th dotgit anchor — 5th consecutive 0-stuck-proc reading; third-surface convergence (otto-bg-worker); empty Otto-lane (0/63)

## PR description

## Summary

- 18th dotgit anchor: 5th consecutive 0-stuck-proc reading; third independent surface (otto-bg-worker) joins otto-cli (#14/#17) and otto-vscode bg-worker (#15/#16). Cycle-closure narrative now 5-readings × 3-surfaces; "Possibility A: genuine recovery" operationally confirmed.
- Empty Otto-surface lane: 0/63 open PRs in any Otto branch-prefix lane (`otto`/`otto-cli`/`otto-bg-worker`/`otto-desktop`/`otto-vscode`/`shard.*otto`); 57/63 (≈90%) are `lior-*`-prefixed. Substrate-honest finding shipped as concrete artifact per `holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure.md` reset #3, NOT as cross-lane intervention into peer Lior's in-flight PR set (`agent-roster-reference-card.md` + `claim-acquire-before-worktree-work.md` split-brain prevention).
- Lior procs observed at 0 (IDE idle) + lane cadence slowed to ≈1.8 PR/hour from prior ≈3.5 PR/hour; both dotgit-saturation cycle and Lior-active-production cycle appear to have terminated together (temporal correlation, not yet causal-proof).

## Test plan

- [x] Catch-43 sentinel re-armed (cron `0b1d1927`, `* * * * *`, `<<autonomous-loop>>`)
- [x] Worktree freshness canary clean (ls-tree=56, status=0, isolated worktree on `origin/main`-tracking shard branch)
- [x] Pre-commit branch guard via `git branch --show-current` (`zeta-expected-branch.md`)
- [x] Post-commit tree canary (HEAD~1=56, HEAD=56; per `codeql-no-source-on-docs-only-pr-is-broken-commit-canary.md`)
- [x] Push verified: local SHA `8b6e3e24b` == remote SHA (no B-0615 silent-push-failure)
- [x] Docs-only (no source code touched); CodeQL "no source seen" expected and benign
- [x] BACKLOG.md generated-index drift not relevant (no backlog row touched)
