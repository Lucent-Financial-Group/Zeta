### Thread 1: .cursor/bin/riven-loop-tick.ts:75 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-24T22:31:11Z):

**<sub><sub>![P1 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P1-orange?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Keep regex token on one line to avoid parse failure**

This change turns `text.split(/\r?\n/)` into a regex literal that spans two source lines (`text.split(/...` then `.../)`), which is invalid JavaScript/TypeScript syntax because regular-expression literals cannot contain a line terminator token boundary. In environments that execute this script via Bun/Node-compatible parsing, the file fails to load, so the heartbeat/forward tick loop never runs.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-25T04:13:36Z):

Confirmed P1 — verified directly: the file at the prior PR head contained literal CR + LF bytes (0x0D 0x0A) inside the regex literal between `/` and `/`, not the `\r\n` escape sequences that origin/main has. JS/TS grammar rejects `LineTerminator` in `RegularExpressionBody`, so Bun would fail to load the file and the riven-loop-tick heartbeat would never run.

Pushed `fb5e3df3` via REST git-data API restoring `/\r?\n/` (escape sequences), byte-equivalent to origin/main at that line. `gh api .../contents/...?ref=fb5e3df3` confirms the fix landed. Resolving this thread.
