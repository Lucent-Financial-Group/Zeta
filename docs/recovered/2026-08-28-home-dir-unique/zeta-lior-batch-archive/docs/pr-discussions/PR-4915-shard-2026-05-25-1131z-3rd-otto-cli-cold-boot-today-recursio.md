# PR #4915: shard(2026-05-25/1131Z): 3rd Otto-CLI cold-boot today — recursion-saturation + catch-43-fired-AGAIN

## PR description

## Summary

3rd Otto-CLI fresh-session cold-boot today (after [PR #4911](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4911) at 0613Z + [PR #4914](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4914) at 1009Z). Sentinel re-armed AGAIN at session start.

Substantive observations:

- **Catch-43 has fired 3 times in one day** across separate Otto-CLI sessions (0613Z + 1009Z + 1131Z). Per-session sentinel non-persistence is firmly the dominant mechanism, not the 3-day auto-expire window.
- **55 open PRs** all authored by AceHack on Lior-surface branches; **zero** in otto-cli lane.
- **Literal task predicate** (`gate=BLOCKED` + `nextAction=resolve-threads`) matches **zero PRs**; executing on out-of-lane Lior PRs would violate the 1009Z anchor's explicit "Does NOT touch Lior's branch" boundary.
- **Substrate-drift via parallel-PR landings** (the 1009Z empirical anchor) still active.
- **Recursion-saturation acknowledged** per [`holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure.md`](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/blob/main/.claude/rules/holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure.md) recursion-termination clause — this shard takes the minimal-acknowledgment form, not further pattern elaboration.

## Test plan

- [x] Isolated worktree at `/private/tmp/zeta-otto-cli-1131z-cold-boot` (verify-clean canary: 59/0 tree-size/status)
- [x] Commit canary: HEAD ls-tree = HEAD~1 ls-tree = 59 (+1 file)
- [x] Push verified non-silent: `git ls-remote` matched local SHA `3b7ce735c`
- [x] Sentinel re-armed `71514072` at session start (catch-43 fired AGAIN)
- [ ] CI gate + CodeQL green (docs-only PR; expecting clean pass)
