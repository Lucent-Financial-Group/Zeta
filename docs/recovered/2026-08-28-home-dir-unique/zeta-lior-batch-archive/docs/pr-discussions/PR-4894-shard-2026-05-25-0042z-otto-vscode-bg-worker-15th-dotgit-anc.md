# PR #4894: shard(2026-05-25/0042Z): otto-vscode bg-worker — 15th dotgit anchor (2nd consecutive 0 stuck procs) + Lior-lane 54/60 steady

## PR description

## Summary

Visibility shard continuing 2026-05-24 1607Z → 1608Z → 1804Z → 1902Z → 2033Z → 2206Z + 2026-05-25 0008Z lineage. Three substantive observations:

1. **15th dotgit anchor — 2nd consecutive 0 stuck procs.** First discrimination data point for the A/B posture default-to-both held at 0008Z's 14th anchor. A (genuine recovery) gains evidence; closure NOT yet supportable per 12th-anchor empirical precedent. Next tick is the 3rd discrimination point.
2. **Lior-lane share steady at 54/60 = 90%.** Same 6 non-`lior-*` PRs as 0008Z (byte-identical set); Lior merged 4 own PRs in 34 min (#4863, #4862, #4892, #4893) confirming active driving.
3. **Empirical FP-class check across 24 threads on 3 BLOCKED PRs (#4768, #4781, #4786): 0% FP rate.** Threads are substantive P0/P1 findings (hardcoded paths, label/filename mismatch, broken `launchctl bootout`, persona-name-in-code, runtime-path-delete with broken doc refs) requiring Lior-side fixes — NOT bg-worker no-op resolution. Updates the operating-substrate narrative for current open-PR thread surface.

## Disposition (unchanged from 2033Z + 2206Z)

Bg-worker scope discipline holds: cross-lane resolution at scale would (a) regress Riven tuning, (b) override operator-authored PII threads on #4801-#4803 (named-human-attribution scope), (c) violate no-directives + mechanical-authorization-check, (d) violate honor-those-that-came-before (Lior active: 2 gemini procs; 4 PRs landed in 34 min). Substrate-honest action: visibility shard + cron heartbeat.

## Test plan

- [x] Sentinel re-armed (`a53e75c8`)
- [x] Worktree freshness pre-check passed (ls-tree=55, status=0, ahead/behind=0/0)
- [x] Branch guard PASS before commit (`shard/tick-0042z-otto-vscode-bg-worker-...`)
- [x] Post-commit canary passed (HEAD~1 tree=55, HEAD tree=55; root-tree unchanged because sub-file)
- [x] Push verified (local SHA `308baa76f` = remote SHA)
- [x] FP-class verification across 24 sampled threads — substrate-honest 0% FP empirical finding
- [ ] Auto-merge fires when required checks pass
