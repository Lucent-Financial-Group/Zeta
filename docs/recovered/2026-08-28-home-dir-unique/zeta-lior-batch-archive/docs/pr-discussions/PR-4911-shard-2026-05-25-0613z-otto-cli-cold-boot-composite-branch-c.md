# PR #4911: shard(2026-05-25/0613Z): Otto-CLI cold-boot — composite branch-contamination + lane-empty + peer-covering + dotgit-recovered anchor

## PR description

## Summary

Forced-#6 decomposition per `.claude/rules/holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure.md` counter rule produced an isolated-worktree empirical anchor at 06:13Z 2026-05-25. The substantively-new substrate is a composite operational state-shape:

- **branch-contamination** (current root on peer-Lior `lior-pr-preservation-rebased` with 30+ untracked `lior-*` dirs + 7 modified PR-disc files)
- **Otto-CLI-lane-empty** (`gh pr list --search head:otto-cli` returned `[]`)
- **peer-Otto-VSCode covering** dotgit-recovery substrate via #4909 (20th anchor / 7th-clean reading, 81min auto-armed BLOCKED)
- **dotgit-recovered** (0 stuck `git pack-objects`/`maintenance`/`repack` procs sustained 85min+)

## Brief-ack arc + forced-#6

Six brief-acks #1-#6 with explicit-no-pre-empt at #5 (same-shape-as-peer-covering substrate would have been fabricated engineering); forced-#6 surfaced this isolated-worktree anchor.

## Worktree-add guard results (all 4 passed)

```text
git worktree add -b otto-cli/shard-tick-0613z-2026-05-25 \
  /private/tmp/zeta-otto-cli-0613z-cold-boot origin/main
→ Updating files: 100% (6281/6281), done.
→ HEAD is now at 44bcaff77

rev-parse --git-dir → resolves
status --short      → 0 lines
ls-tree HEAD        → 57 entries
index.lock          → absent
```

Confirms verify-before-defer composition operates correctly under dotgit-recovered tier.

## Test plan

- [x] Branch-guard at commit time (`$(git branch --show-current)` = `$ZETA_EXPECTED_BRANCH`)
- [x] Post-commit canary (parent-tree=57; commit-tree=57; ✓ not collapsed)
- [x] Remote ref verified post-push
- [x] Explicit `--head` ref on `gh pr create` per `.claude/rules/zeta-expected-branch.md` companion defense

## Pull request overview

Adds a new hygiene-history tick shard documenting an Otto-CLI cold-boot observation and the forced-#6 isolated-worktree “empirical anchor” under a composite operational state (branch contamination + empty lane + peer covering + dotgit recovered).

**Changes:**
- Introduces a new tick shard at 2026-05-25T06:13Z capturing the composite-state snapshot and the worktree-add guard results.
- Cross-links the tick narrative to the relevant `.claude/rules/**` discipline files for traceability.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/25/0613Z.md:17 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-25T06:20:50Z):

This tick shard begins with YAML frontmatter (`--- ... ---`). The tick-shard schema tooling expects the first non-empty line to be the 6-column pipe-row header (see `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/README.md` and `tools/hygiene/check-tick-history-shard-schema.ts`), so this file would currently fail that validator if/when it’s wired into CI or pre-push checks. Consider switching to the documented “hybrid” format: pipe-row first line, then the H1 body, and (if desired) move this metadata into a fenced ```yaml block inside the body instead of file-head frontmatter.
