# PR #4909: shard(2026-05-25/0443Z): 20th dotgit anchor — 7th consecutive 0-stuck-proc reading + cadence resumed (36min)

## PR description

## Summary

20th dotgit anchor in the 2026-05-23→2026-05-25 saturation-arc series. **7th consecutive 0-stuck-proc reading** — Otto-bg-worker fresh cold-boot via the claude-loop integrated worktree.

| Reading | Value |
|---|---|
| Stuck git pack/maintenance/repack procs | **0** (7th consecutive) |
| `.git/index.lock` | absent |
| Lior loop procs | 0 |
| Peer agent procs (claude/gemini/kiro/alexa/lior union) | 43 |
| origin/main HEAD | `44bcaff77` (PR #4905) |
| Cadence vs #19 | **36 min** (resumed; refutes #19's Possibility D) |
| Cold-boot worktree state | `worktree-lively-tickling-stearns` clean; `HEAD == origin/main` from cold-boot |

## Why this anchor matters

1. **7th consecutive clean** — saturation recovery operationally robust across short (≤36min) AND long (>1h) cadence
2. **First clean cold-boot** in the 20-anchor series — claude-loop's per-session worktree allocation may be structural protection vs the peer-branch-contamination failure mode documented at #5/#7/#8/#10/#12/#13/#19. Naming the hypothesis; will see if it holds across #21+
3. **Cadence resumed at 36min** after #19's 1h24min gap — refutes #19's Possibility D (operator-side pause). New Possibility E (inherent variance) preserved alongside C (longer-cycle self-tuning)
4. **Otto lane STILL empty** (0 PRs) vs Lior lane dominant (60 PRs). Lane discipline holds: the autonomous-loop prompt's generic "fix BLOCKED PR threads" instruction is **boilerplate**, not operative cross-lane authorization (per [`mechanical-authorization-check.md`](../../../../../../.claude/rules/mechanical-authorization-check.md))

## Test plan

- [x] Branch guard via `git branch --show-current` before commit
- [x] ls-tree HEAD == ls-tree origin/main (57/57; canary clean)
- [x] Post-push `git ls-remote` verification (LOCAL == REMOTE; B-0615 silent-push canary clean)
- [x] No peer worktree contention (0 Lior procs, 0 stuck plumbing)
- [ ] CI passes (CodeQL + gate workflows)
- [ ] Auto-merge arms cleanly

## Pull request overview

Adds the 2026-05-25 04:43Z hygiene-history “tick shard” (20th dotgit-saturation anchor) documenting another clean (0 stuck git procs) reading and resumed cadence after the prior >1h gap.

**Changes:**
- Add a new tick entry under `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/25/` capturing the 0443Z observations, cadence interpretation, and cross-links to prior anchors/rules.

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/25/0443Z.md:25 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-25T04:49:02Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Fix inconsistent PR delta count**

The `origin/main HEAD` delta reports `+5 PRs in 36min` but the parenthetical list contains six PR references (including an uncertain `#4906?`), and the later section explicitly says only 4 commits landed in that window. Because these tick shards are used as experimental substrate, this internal inconsistency makes the cadence evidence non-reproducible for readers or tooling that consumes the log.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

### Thread 2: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/25/0443Z.md:25 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-25T04:49:42Z):

The “origin/main HEAD” delta claims “+5 PRs in 36min” and includes #4906? and #4907, but later this tick lists only 4 commits landing between #19 and this anchor (#4905, #4908, #4885, #4883). Since 0407Z already observed HEAD at #4907, please reconcile this row (likely +4 PRs/commits, and remove #4906/#4907 from the delta list) so the tick stays internally consistent.
