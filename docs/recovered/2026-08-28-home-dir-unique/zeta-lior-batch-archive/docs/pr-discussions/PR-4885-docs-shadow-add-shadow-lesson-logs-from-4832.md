## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/research/shadow-lesson-log-20260522-stale-locks.md:19 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-24T22:33:56Z):

P0: The unordered list items use `*   ` (three spaces after the marker). This likely violates markdownlint MD030 (expected 1 space) and can fail CI for this non-ignored research file. Use a single space after the list marker (e.g., `- ` or `* `).

**@AceHack** (2026-05-25T04:15:46Z):

Confirmed P0 — both list groups (Implications lines 17-19 + Action Items lines 25-27) used `* ` + 3 spaces, violating MD030. Verified directly via gh api .../contents; the markdownlint CI failure log matches the exact same lines. Pushed `5ebc65e7` via REST git-data API collapsing all 6 markers to `* ` + 1 space. Resolving thread.
