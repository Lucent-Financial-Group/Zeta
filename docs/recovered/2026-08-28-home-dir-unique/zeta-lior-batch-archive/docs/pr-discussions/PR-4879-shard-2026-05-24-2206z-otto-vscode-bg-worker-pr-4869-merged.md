# PR #4879: shard(2026-05-24/2206Z): otto-vscode bg-worker — PR #4869 merged via FP-thread resolve (53→58 fleet)

## PR description

## Summary

- **PR #4869 merged** (`2f598116`) — own-lane otto-vscode shard from prior tick 2033Z; resolved via FP-thread classification per [`blocked-green-ci-investigate-threads.md`](../blob/main/.claude/rules/blocked-green-ci-investigate-threads.md) "stale-but-fresh-looking findings" sub-pattern. Codex review on gitlink-removal was filed 33min AFTER #4871 had merged the corrective explanation; no-op resolve was the substrate-honest move.
- **Fleet 53→58 PRs** open; sustained 100% Lior-lane share (6th consecutive observation in the lineage)
- **First own-lane merge** in the 5-shard lineage — validates the bg-worker discipline path (author shards → collect FP threads → resolve threads → main advances)

## Test plan

- [x] Sentinel re-armed (`e8248abd`) per `tick-must-never-stop.md` catch-43
- [x] PR #4869 thread `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM6Ea5Wn` resolved via GraphQL `resolveReviewThread`
- [x] PR #4869 merged to `2f598116` (auto-merge fired post-resolve)
- [x] Post-commit canary: ls-tree HEAD~1=55, HEAD=55 (no corruption)
- [x] Branch verified before commit per `zeta-expected-branch.md` race-window-caveat
- [x] Claude Code isolated worktree (not contested root)

## Pull request overview

Adds a new hygiene-history tick shard for **2026-05-24 2206Z**, documenting the merge of PR #4869 via FP-thread resolution and updating the observed fleet metrics (53→58 open PRs) while continuing lane-discipline reporting.

**Changes:**
- Adds a new tick report capturing the 2206Z snapshot (fleet counts, API budgets, main HEAD, and recent commits).
- Documents the FP-thread “stale-but-fresh-looking findings” resolution that unblocked auto-merge for PR #4869.
- Extends the lane-scope lineage table through the new 2206Z observation.

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/24/2206Z.md:42 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-24T22:11:26Z):

The shard count arithmetic is inconsistent: this sentence says "Six consecutive observations (5 otto-vscode + 2 otto-cli)", but 5+2=7 and the table below lists 6 shards (2 otto-cli + 4 otto-vscode). Please reconcile by correcting the breakdown (likely 4 otto-vscode + 2 otto-cli) or adjusting the stated total/table to match.
