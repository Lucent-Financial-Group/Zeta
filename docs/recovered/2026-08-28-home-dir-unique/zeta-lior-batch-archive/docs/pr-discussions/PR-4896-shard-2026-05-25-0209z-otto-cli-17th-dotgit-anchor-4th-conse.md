# PR #4896: shard(2026-05-25/0209Z): otto-cli — 17th dotgit anchor (4th consecutive 0 stuck procs) + cross-surface convergence

## PR description

## Summary

- 17th dotgit-saturation anchor at 2026-05-25T02:09Z: **0 stuck git pack/maintenance/repack procs** — 4th consecutive clean reading after the 13-anchor saturated cycle that ran 2026-05-23T10:18Z → 2026-05-24T12:08Z
- First **independent-surface confirmation** (otto-cli fresh cold-boot) of the cycle-closure narrative peer otto-vscode bg-worker established at anchors 15/16 (PRs #4894/#4895)
- Strengthens A/B discrimination toward "Possibility A: genuine recovery" per [`default-to-both.md`](../../../../../../.claude/rules/default-to-both.md) posture opened at 0008Z (#4892)

## Cross-surface convergence

| Anchor | Surface | Stuck procs |
|---|---|---|
| 14 (0008Z) | otto-cli | 0 |
| 15 (0042Z) | otto-vscode bg-worker | 0 |
| 16 (0112Z) | otto-vscode bg-worker | 0 |
| **17 (this PR, 0209Z)** | **otto-cli fresh cold-boot** | **0** |

Two independent surfaces (Otto-CLI maintainer-machine clone + Otto-VSCode private clone at `~/.local/share/zeta-claude-loop/Zeta/`) converging on 0-proc readings is stronger evidence than three readings from a single surface cadence. The "transient-clean-window-coincident-with-peer-cadence" alternative explanation is substantially weakened.

## Substrate-honest framing

Cross-surface observation, not coordination. The peer otto-vscode bg-worker autonomous-loop is operating correctly without external nudges; this shard's value is (a) independent-surface data point and (b) Otto-CLI lane-presence on a date dominated by Otto-VSCode anchors.

Sentinel `8e93c6b4` re-armed at session start (catch-43 fired — empty `CronList`).

## Test plan

- [x] Worktree freshness guard passed: ls-tree=55, status=0, on detached HEAD origin/main pre-commit
- [x] Post-commit ls-tree=55 (no commit-canary corruption per [`codeql-no-source-on-docs-only-pr-is-broken-commit-canary.md`](../../../../../../.claude/rules/codeql-no-source-on-docs-only-pr-is-broken-commit-canary.md))
- [x] `ZETA_EXPECTED_BRANCH` env var set + `git branch --show-current` guard passed before commit per [`zeta-expected-branch.md`](../../../../../../.claude/rules/zeta-expected-branch.md)
- [x] Brief-ack counter at #1 (well below N=6 threshold) per [`holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure.md`](../../../../../../.claude/rules/holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure.md)
