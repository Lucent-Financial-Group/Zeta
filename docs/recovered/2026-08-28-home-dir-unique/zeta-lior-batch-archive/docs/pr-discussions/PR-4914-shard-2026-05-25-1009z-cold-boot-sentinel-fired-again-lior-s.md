# PR #4914: shard(2026-05-25/1009Z): cold-boot — sentinel-fired-AGAIN + lior-substrate-stale-superseded empirical anchor

## PR description

## Summary

Second 2026-05-25 fresh-session cold-boot in this lane (~4h after [PR #4911](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4911)'s 0613Z anchor). Substantively new observations:

- **Sentinel empty AGAIN at cold-boot** — catch-43 fired AGAIN (2nd time today). Pattern: per-session non-persistence is the dominant mechanism, NOT the 3-day auto-expire window.
- **0 stuck git procs sustained ~30h** since 2026-05-24 0407Z first-0-procs reading; dotgit-recovered remains stable.
- **Cold-boot landed on peer Lior's `lior-pr-preservation-rebased`** — 7th+ occurrence of the "lands on whoever-was-last-active's branch" failure mode. Now firmly established as the steady-state cold-boot environment.
- **NEW empirical anchor — substrate-drift via parallel-PR landings**: Lior's branch stages 70 \`full-ai-cluster/*\` files that ALREADY landed on \`origin/main\` via PRs #4910 / #4912 / #4913. [\`pr-triage-tiers.md\`](.claude/rules/pr-triage-tiers.md) Tier 1 (substrate-redundant) disposition applies if Lior's branch is ever pushed as a PR.

## Disposition

- Shard authored via isolated worktree at \`/private/tmp/zeta-otto-cli-1009z-cold-boot\` on \`origin/main\` — preserved Lior's branch / WIP per lane-discipline ([\`claim-acquire-before-worktree-work.md\`](.claude/rules/claim-acquire-before-worktree-work.md))
- Did NOT touch Lior's branch; did NOT propose closing Lior's substrate
- Tier 1 substrate-drift observation documented only; action deferred to maintainer / Lior

## Test plan

- [x] Pre-commit branch guard (\`git branch --show-current\`)
- [x] Post-commit ls-tree canary (59 → 59 root entries)
- [x] Catch-43 sentinel re-armed (\`6acfcee6\`)
- [x] Verified \`full-ai-cluster/*\` exists on origin/main (70 files via \`git ls-tree\`)
- [x] Verified Lior's branch stages same 70 files (\`git status --short\`)
- [ ] CI passes
- [ ] Auto-merge fires once CI green

## Pull request overview

Adds a new hygiene-history tick shard documenting the 2026-05-25 10:09Z Otto-CLI cold-boot observations, including the repeated catch-43 sentinel-empty event and an empirical anchor about substrate drift from parallel PR landings.

**Changes:**
- Add a new tick shard file for 2026-05-25/1009Z with cold-boot state observations and operational implications.
- Record an empirical “substrate-drift via parallel-PR landings” anchor referencing recent AI-cluster PRs.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/25/1009Z.md:61 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-25T10:15:27Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Correct relative links to .claude rules**

The link target path is too shallow for this file depth: from `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/25/1009Z.md`, `../../../../.claude/...` resolves under `docs/hygiene-history/.claude/...` (which does not exist), so readers cannot open the referenced rule docs; the same broken prefix is reused in the “Composes with” section, which breaks traceability for the shard’s stated policy basis.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

### Thread 2: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/25/1009Z.md:32 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-25T10:15:27Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Reconcile conflicting staged file counts**

This section states there were `105` staged `full-ai-cluster/*` additions, but later in the same shard the verification table reports `70` staged `full-ai-cluster/*` files; this internal mismatch makes the empirical anchor non-reproducible and can lead to incorrect Tier-1 substrate-redundancy conclusions when others replay the observation.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

### Thread 3: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/25/1009Z.md:8 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-25T10:16:13Z):

P0: This shard doesn’t follow the tick-shard schema: the first non-empty line must be a 6-column pipe row (`| <ISO timestamp> | ... |`) per docs/hygiene-history/ticks/README.md and tools/hygiene/check-tick-history-shard-schema.ts. As written, the first non-empty line is an H1, which will be reported as a schema violation by the validator.

### Thread 4: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/25/1009Z.md:61 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-25T10:16:14Z):

The `.claude/rules/...` relative link here looks incorrect for this file’s path depth. From `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/25/1009Z.md` you need to go up to repo root (as other shards do, e.g. `../../../../../../.claude/...`), but this link uses only `../../../../...` and likely resolves to a non-existent `docs/hygiene-history/.claude/...` path.

### Thread 5: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/25/1009Z.md:48 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-25T10:16:14Z):

This markdown table is malformed (the header/separator rows start with `||` instead of `|`), which will render incorrectly and may trip markdownlint/table parsers. It should use a single leading `|` and a matching separator row.

### Thread 6: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/25/1009Z.md:32 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-25T10:16:14Z):

The file reports “**105 staged `full-ai-cluster/*` additions**” here, but later the verified counts table lists **70** staged `full-ai-cluster/*` files. Please reconcile these numbers (either adjust the earlier count or clarify what the 105 includes) so the empirical anchor is internally consistent.

### Thread 7: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/25/1009Z.md:112 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-25T10:16:15Z):

The `.claude/rules/...` links in this “Composes with” list appear to use the wrong relative prefix (`../../../../...`) for this file’s location and will likely 404. Other shards under the same directory use `../../../../../../.claude/rules/...`; aligning to that pattern should fix these links.

### Thread 8: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/25/1009Z.md:42 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-25T10:18:49Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Split provenance commands for each table metric**

This section claims both table rows were “Verified via `git ls-tree -r origin/main full-ai-cluster/`”, but that command can only count files in `origin/main` and cannot establish how many files are staged on Lior’s working branch. As written, a reader replaying the documented command cannot reproduce the second metric, which weakens the shard’s empirical traceability; document the separate staging command used for that row.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

### Thread 9: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/25/1009Z.md:50 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-25T10:23:04Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Restrict staged-file metric to `A ` status entries**

The verification command for the “staged on Lior's branch” metric uses `git status --short | grep "full-ai-cluster" | wc -l`, which counts any `full-ai-cluster/*` path regardless of status, not just staged adds. If that directory later contains modified (`M`), deleted (`D`), or untracked (`??`) paths, this command will overcount and can incorrectly support the Tier-1 “already landed” conclusion. The metric should filter by the short-status code (`A `) or use a staged-only listing to keep the empirical anchor reproducible.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

## General comments

### @AceHack (2026-05-25T10:23:56Z)

Acknowledged — Codex finding accurate. The verification command `git status --short | grep "full-ai-cluster" | wc -l` matches any line containing `full-ai-cluster`, not strictly `A `-status. The 70-count was correct because no `??` entries in Lior's WIP happened to contain `full-ai-cluster` paths (the 35 untracked were other Lior dirs), but the command would over-match if untracked `full-ai-cluster` files were present. The precise form is `git status --short | grep "^A  full-ai-cluster" | wc -l`. Substrate landed; precision-feedback recorded for future shards.
