## What

`discoverExpectedApplications` in `src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/argocd-health-test.ts`
sorted the Application directory names with `localeCompare`. That is
culture-SENSITIVE — the same names order differently per machine locale and ICU
version (`.claude/rules/culture-invariant-by-default.md`; the live failure on
file is `081KT07NV0008QG0R001YDB73K`).

This is not display ordering. It is the canonical order of the roster that every
caller of `discoverExpectedApplications()` iterates, so a locale-dependent
comparator is a locale-dependent roster.

It was the last `load-bearing-pending-sweep` row in
`lint-no-culture-sensitive-collation.baseline.json`, carried there with the
reason *"whose key domain was not measured in this PR"*. The key domain is
measured now.

## Measured, not asserted

The roster is **byte-identical before and after**, in every locale tried
(`C`, `en_US.UTF-8`, `sv_SE.UTF-8`, `tr_TR.UTF-8`) — md5
`b064e018eb5df6c0cbdff90064810405` both ways.

So this removes a **latent** hazard rather than repairing a live divergence, and
which one it is matters enough to say out loud. The hazard is real but narrow:
today's directory names are all lowercase ASCII, the one region where ICU
ordering and code-point ordering happen to agree. A name carrying case or
punctuation splits them:

| comparator | order |
|---|---|
| `localeCompare` | `vllm Vllm VLLM-a vllm-router vllm2 vllmrouter` |
| `stringCompare` (ordinal) | `VLLM-a Vllm vllm vllm-router vllm2 vllmrouter` |

## The falsifier is the removed baseline row, not the comparator swap

A ratchet lets a file's count fall to zero without touching the baseline. So
paying the debt down and leaving the row would have kept this file licensed for
one instance forever — compliance that constrains nothing, which is the vacuity
class exactly.

With the row removed, re-introducing `localeCompare` here is a `new-file`
violation. Verified by reverting the file and re-running the linter:

```
exit 1 — src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/argocd-health-test.ts  (1 found, baseline allows 0)
             :1444  localeCompare — linguistic, locale- and ICU-dependent ordering
```

With the row still present the same tree exits 0. That is the check that can fail.

## Checks run locally (at `9a2f0a876`)

- `bun src/Core.TypeScript/hygiene/lint-no-culture-sensitive-collation.ts` → exit 0,
  *"no new culture-sensitive collation in 3034 tracked files (151 baselined instance(s) remaining)"* (was 152)
- `bun test src/Core.TypeScript/hygiene/lint-no-culture-sensitive-collation.test.ts` → 31 pass / 0 fail
- `bunx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json` → exit 0

## Note on the rest of the red-on-main sweep

The four checks reported red at `4de7a4ee2` were already fixed on `main` by
#13830 and #13834 before this branch was cut; `gate` run
[32589832950](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/actions/runs/32589832950)
at `2d18dba1f` is green on all three jobs that carried them. This PR is the one
piece those left behind: the baselined `argocd-health-test.ts` site, which the
tripwire covers but permits.
