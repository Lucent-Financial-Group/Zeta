`agent-heartbeat` is red on `main`. Four jobs in the latest run — otto, alexa and
soraya's ticks plus the alexa flush — all fail the same way:

    prepare-heartbeat-branch: carry unflushed heartbeat state failed:
    CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in data/ci-runs.jsonl

Green through 21:52Z (8062645bc), red at 22:05Z (79ff032a2) and 22:24Z (9f861ebef).

SEVENTH member of the declared-merge-path class, and the drift-rate sibling of
`data/rs-blocks.jsonl`, which already carries `merge=union` two lines above. This
one was simply missed.

WHY IT APPEARED FOUR HOURS AFTER THE PATH DID. Until #13928 the heartbeat step ran
`git add data/ci-runs.jsonl` and never committed. The workflow says so in its own
comment: the file "has never existed on main ... green on every tick and produced
nothing", the silent-no-op pattern in its purest form. The moment that step started
COMMITTING, all three lanes began creating the same brand-new path independently —
add/add by construction, because the merge base has neither side.

WHY UNION IS SAFE HERE — measured, not assumed:
  * append-only: the sole writer is `appendFileSync(dataPath, ...)` in
    `observe/drift-rate-cli.ts` `doRecord`. No path rewrites an existing line.
  * single-writer PER ROW: every row carries a `lane` field naming the emitting
    agent, exactly as `rs-blocks.jsonl` rows carry `agent`. Main's copy holds this
    lane's flushed rows plus other lanes' rows, never a rival edit to one row.

REPRODUCED IN A SCRATCH REPO before writing the line, rather than argued from the
sibling:
  * two branches each CREATING the file -> `CONFLICT (add/add)`, live message verbatim
  * same pair with the attribute -> "Auto-merging", clean, both lanes' rows kept,
    zero conflict markers
  * partial-flush (both sides carry the flushed rows, lane has one more) -> clean,
    and `sort | uniq -d` is EMPTY: identical additions on both sides resolve to one
    copy, so union does not duplicate a flushed row

THE FALSIFIER IS A TEST, NOT THE COMMENT. `prepare-heartbeat-branch.test.ts` gains
"carries the drift-rate CI log when two lanes CREATED it independently". It differs
from every sibling case in the file on purpose: the others put a PREFIX of the
lane's file on main, so the sides overlap and the question is duplication. Here the
sides are DISJOINT — no shared line, no merge base — which is the shape that
actually wedged. Verified it can fail: deleting the `.gitattributes` line takes the
suite to 13 pass / 1 fail with

    carry unflushed heartbeat state failed: Auto-merging data/ci-runs.jsonl
    Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

STATED LIMIT, same as the sibling above it: no check enforces row uniqueness on this
path. Union is safe on the append-only + per-row-single-writer argument alone. If a
row ever becomes editable — a backfill that rewrites an outcome — the line must go.

Local: `bun test src/Core.TypeScript/agent-heartbeats/` 90 pass / 0 fail.
