# PR #3941: research(B-0562): QG isomorphism Step 2 — cube + Adinkra + Cayley-Dickson → HaPPY-like QECC

## PR description

## Summary

Step 2 of the 4-step QG isomorphism proof path opened in [B-0543](docs/backlog/) / [#3614](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3614). Unfolds the two axioms (Remember-When + Pay-Attention) into a 4-axis cube, grafts the Adinkra-Gates supermultiplet layer on cube vertices, lifts through a Cayley-Dickson tower (R → C → H → O → S → T), and proposes the algebraic shape that matches HaPPY (holographic perfect-tensor) QEC codes.

## Why this is Step 2

Step 1 (B-0544, shipped via #3614) formalized `Zeta_{RA} = (Zeta, M, A)` — a topos `Zeta` with internal monad `M` for memory and modal operator `A` for attention. The Step 2 question is: **what's the algebraic structure of the extension when you let the two axioms factor through richer carriers (Adinkra symmetry + division-algebra tower)?** This research seed identifies HaPPY-style holographic perfect tensors as the candidate algebraic shape.

## Files

- `docs/backlog/P2/B-0562-qg-isomorphism-step-2-cube-adinkra-cayley-dickson-to-happylike-qecc-2026-05-16.md` (101 lines — backlog row, P2, depends_on [B-0543, B-0544])
- `docs/research/2026-05-15-qg-isomorphism-step-2-cube-adinkra-cayley-dickson-to-happylike-qecc.md` (173 lines — research seed)

## ID-allocation note (B-0545 → B-0562 renumber)

Originally allocated as **B-0545**. Collided with [#3619](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3619)'s renumber-sweep that re-took B-0545 for Riven's cursor-terminal loop work. Renumbered to **B-0562** — the next free above all merged-on-main (highest B-0560) plus in-flight [#3878](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3878)'s B-0561 allocation. Discipline per `.claude/rules/otto-channels-reference-card.md`'s multi-Otto ID-allocation section.

## Crash-recovery context

This row + research file were authored by the pre-crash Otto session and were the **only** artifacts that hadn't already shipped via concurrent PRs:
- Rule (`premise-flagged-unverified-...`) landed via [#3935](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3935)
- B-0507 follow-on landed via [#3937](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3937)
- Lior tick fix landed via [#3936](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3936)
- My initial duplicate-rule PR [#3940](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3940) (closed) is the audit trail for the per-artifact refresh-before-decide lesson

Per-artifact `git show origin/main:<path>` checks caught all four duplications BEFORE this push.

## Test plan

- [ ] Backlog index regenerates clean (if regeneration tool runs)
- [ ] No markdownlint failures on either file
- [ ] No cross-file broken-link warnings (links use repo-relative paths)
- [ ] Step 3 / Step 4 backlog rows can reference B-0562 as `depends_on` once they're filed

## Pull request overview

This PR adds two history-surface artifacts for Step 2 of the B-0543 QG isomorphism proof path: a P2 backlog row and a research seed describing a proposed mapping from a 4-axis cube + Adinkra layer + Cayley-Dickson tower onto a HaPPY-like quantum error-correcting code structure. It is documentation/research-only, with no code or tooling changes.

**Changes:**
- Adds backlog row `B-0562` (P2, in_progress, depends_on B-0543/B-0544) describing the Step 2 research scope, effort (XL), and open questions.
- Adds a research seed sketching the cube-face → boundary, edges → entanglement, vertices → bulk operators, and Adinkra → SUSY-generators mapping toward HaPPY-style entanglement-wedge reconstruction.
- Notes the B-0545 → B-0562 renumber to avoid collision with #3619 / #3878 in-flight allocations.

### Thread 1: docs/backlog/P2/B-0562-qg-isomorphism-step-2-cube-adinkra-cayley-dickson-to-happylike-qecc-2026-05-16.md:22 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-16T21:07:16Z):

**<sub><sub>![P1 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P1-orange?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Renumber the quoted ordered-list item to satisfy lint**

This line starts an ordered-list item at `2.` inside a blockquote, which violates the repo’s enabled markdown rule `MD029` (list prefixes must follow the configured numbering style). The required CI job `lint (markdownlint)` runs `markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"` in `.github/workflows/gate.yml`, and `docs/backlog/**` is not ignored in `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`, so this commit introduces a deterministic lint failure that blocks a green gate.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-16T21:14:11Z):

Fixed in 1aebb44 — reframed the quoted "step 2" as bold prose `> **Step 2.**` so the line is no longer an ordered-list item under a blockquote. Preserves the semantic (this is genuinely Step 2 of the parent B-0543 proof strategy) while satisfying MD029.

### Thread 2: docs/backlog/P2/B-0562-qg-isomorphism-step-2-cube-adinkra-cayley-dickson-to-happylike-qecc-2026-05-16.md:102 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-16T21:07:16Z):

**<sub><sub>![P1 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P1-orange?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Add a trailing newline to keep markdownlint green**

The file ends without a final newline, triggering markdown rule `MD047` (`single-trailing-newline`). Because the workflow’s required markdownlint job checks this backlog file path, this missing newline causes a reproducible CI failure even though the document content is otherwise valid.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-16T21:14:12Z):

Fixed in 1aebb44 — added trailing newline.

### Thread 3: docs/research/2026-05-15-qg-isomorphism-step-2-cube-adinkra-cayley-dickson-to-happylike-qecc.md:3 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T21:16:15Z):

The research file is dated `2026-05-15` in its filename but the frontmatter-style header inside says `**Date:** 2026-05-16`, and the backlog row's `created`/`last_updated` are also `2026-05-16`. Consider aligning the filename date with the actual creation date (`2026-05-16`) for consistency with the backlog row and the in-file date.

### Thread 4: docs/BACKLOG.md:596 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T21:16:15Z):

B-0551 ("QG isomorphism step 2 — formalize infinite-game extension topos and QECC algebraic structure", line 595, same priority P2, also created 2026-05-16) appears to cover the same Step 2 slot in the 4-step proof path as this new B-0562. If they're intentionally distinct sub-slices, that should be made explicit (e.g., add `composes_with: [B-0551]` to B-0562's frontmatter and a one-liner in each row clarifying the split — formal QECC structure vs. cube+Adinkra+Cayley-Dickson algebraic shape). As-is, two open P2 rows titled "QG isomorphism Step 2 — …" on adjacent lines of `docs/BACKLOG.md` look like an unintended duplicate.

### Thread 5: docs/backlog/P2/B-0562-qg-isomorphism-step-2-cube-adinkra-cayley-dickson-to-happylike-qecc-2026-05-16.md:12 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T21:16:16Z):

The frontmatter declares `depends_on: [B-0543, B-0544]` but the "Composes with" prose section lists B-0543 and B-0544 alongside several other items (Riven cube doc, Step 1 research doc, MANIFESTO.md, two `.claude/rules/*.md` files), while `composes_with: []` is empty in frontmatter. The structured `composes_with` field should reflect the prose list (or the prose should be narrowed) so that backlog-index/edge-audit tooling sees the real composition edges — per `tools/hygiene/audit-backlog-items.ts`, only the frontmatter edges are extracted for analysis.
