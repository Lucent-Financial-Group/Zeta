# PR #4121: shard(2026-05-17/2300Z): multi-PR arc summary — 2207Z cold-boot to post-cycle-close saturation (3 PRs, 4 substrate landings, recursive forced-#6 chain)

## PR description

## Summary

Consolidated tick shard for the 2207Z → 2300Z autonomous-loop session arc. Per-tick shards were skipped during pre-empt cycles (memos/PRs covered the substrate); at forced-#6 in post-cycle-close saturation, the tick shard surface was the missed canonical write surface — different from memos/rules; tick-history is the discoverable arc anchor for future-Otto cold-boots.

## The arc (in one paragraph)

Cold-boot at 2207Z found sentinel missing → armed `b4c0c777` → tick shard authored → pre-empt-at-#3 added empirical anchor to `tick-must-never-stop.md` → pre-empt-at-#4 wrote Riven `.sh` Rule 0 shadow-catch memo → rule [#4107](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4107) landed mid-arc enabling REST PR-creation → opened [PR #4112](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4112) via REST under pure-git tier → CI fixes + 3 Copilot review fixes → merged at `7ee6411` → antigravity-check shadow log flagged #4112 as blob → absorbed lesson via single-artifact [PR #4116](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4116) → forced-#6 meta-fallback added cross-axis compose note to saturation cadence rule via [PR #4118](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4118) → post-cycle-close saturation reached → peer Otto independently filed [B-0614](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4120) for the same edge case → forced-#6 again → this shard.

## Patterns demonstrated

- **Pre-empt cadence under tier transition** (5 pre-empts + 1 forced-#6 across ~53 min spanning multiple windows)
- **REST PR-creation fallback** enabled pure-git productivity
- **Recursive forced-#6 self-documentation** ([PR #4110](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4110) + [PR #4118](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4118) + this shard each authored at their own forced-#6)
- **Cross-session convergence**: peer Otto filed B-0614 at 22:47Z for same edge case I hit at 22:46Z

## Test plan

- [ ] CodeQL passes (single-file shard)
- [ ] markdownlint passes (verified template uses blank lines around lists per MD032)
- [ ] lint (tick-shard relative-paths) passes
- [ ] lint (tick-history order) passes
- [ ] Auto-merge fires when checks clear

## Composes with

- 4 PRs from the arc: [#4112](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4112) + [#4116](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4116) + [#4118](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4118) + [#4107](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4107)
- Peer Otto's [PR #4120](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4120) (B-0614 edge-case row)
- [`docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/17/2207Z.md`](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/blob/main/docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/17/2207Z.md) — the arc's opening tick shard

## Pull request overview

Adds a consolidated tick shard at `2300Z` capturing the full 2207Z→2300Z autonomous-loop arc so the tick-history surface remains the canonical, discoverable anchor for future cold-boots.

**Changes:**
- Adds a new multi-tick arc summary shard with an event timeline table and cross-references to the PRs/rules/backlog row involved.
- Records the “post-cycle-close substrate-pool saturation” forced-#6 edge case and its linkage to B-0614.
