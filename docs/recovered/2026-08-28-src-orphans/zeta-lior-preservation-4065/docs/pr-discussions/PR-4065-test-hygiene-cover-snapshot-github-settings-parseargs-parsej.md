# PR #4065: test(hygiene): cover snapshot-github-settings parseArgs+parseJsonSafe (B-0156 ph2)

## PR description

## Summary

Lands the missing `bun test` for `tools/hygiene/snapshot-github-settings.ts`, closing the first of four gaps in **B-0156** acceptance criterion #2 ("each TS sibling has at least one `bun test` covering its primary entry path").

## What

- Exports two internal helpers (`parseArgs`, `parseJsonSafe`) from `snapshot-github-settings.ts` purely for testability — no behavior change in `main()`.
- `parseArgs` gains an optional `resolveDefault: () => Promise<string>` parameter; default value preserves the existing `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner` fallback, so production behavior is unchanged. Tests inject a deterministic stub.
- Adds `tools/hygiene/snapshot-github-settings.test.ts` (14 tests / 25 expect calls) covering:
  - `parseJsonSafe`: valid object/array, null/empty/invalid input, explicit fallback, no-throw on garbage
  - `parseArgs`: `--repo OWNER/NAME`, positional arg, `--repo` without value error, `GH_REPO` env fallback, argv > env precedence, resolver fallback, no-repo-anywhere error, full precedence chain

## Why

Per `.claude/rules/backlog-item-start-gate.md` step 0 substrate-drift discriminator: B-0156's audit baseline claims phases 3-5 still have work remaining, but on-disk reality (verified at session start) shows all six `.ts` siblings exist AND the `.sh` originals are already deleted. The row is **in-progress, NOT drift** — what remains is acceptance criterion #2 coverage. This PR closes 1/4 of that gap.

Remaining test gaps after this PR (separate bounded slices, each its own PR):
- `tools/hygiene/check-github-settings-drift.ts`
- `tools/peer-call/amara.ts`
- `tools/peer-call/ani.ts`

(Note: the row's audit section under "Phase 3 — Peer-call completion" and "Phase 4 — Profile shell-helper" describes work as remaining; on-disk reality shows it's done. Recommend a follow-up row-update PR to refresh the audit baseline; kept out of this PR to honor "exactly one bounded step".)

## Focused checks

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `bun test tools/hygiene/snapshot-github-settings.test.ts` | 14 pass / 0 fail / 25 expect calls |
| `bun test tools/hygiene/` (no regressions in hygiene suite) | 195 pass / 0 fail / 364 expect calls across 11 files |
| `bun --bun build tools/hygiene/snapshot-github-settings.ts` | OK (9.65 KB bundled, no type errors) |
| `git ls-tree HEAD \| wc -l` post-commit canary | 53 (matches `origin/main`; no commit-tree corruption) |
| `gh pr create --head <branch>` (explicit head, parallel-Otto safe) | this PR |

## Test plan

- [ ] CI: `gate.yml` runs `bun test` and exercises the new file
- [ ] No regression in `tools/hygiene/` other suites
- [ ] CodeQL still finds source (canary clean: tree size 53 = `origin/main`)

## Composes with

- B-0156 (parent row — TypeScript standardization)
- `tools/hygiene/check-tick-history-shard-schema.test.ts` (mirrored pattern: export pure entry point, exercise from `bun:test`)
- `.claude/rules/backlog-item-start-gate.md` (substrate-drift step 0 — confirmed row is in-progress, not drift)
- `.claude/rules/codeql-no-source-on-docs-only-pr-is-broken-commit-canary.md` (canary tree-size check applied post-commit)
- `.claude/rules/zeta-expected-branch.md` (commit guard + isolated worktree + race-window mitigation)

## Pull request overview

Adds Bun test coverage for `tools/hygiene/snapshot-github-settings.ts` by exporting and exercising its argument/JSON parsing helpers without changing production `main()` behavior.

**Changes:**
- Exports `parseJsonSafe`, `Args`, `ParseResult`, and `parseArgs`.
- Extracts the GitHub CLI repo fallback into `resolveRepoViaGh`.
- Adds 14 Bun tests covering JSON parsing fallbacks and repo argument precedence.
