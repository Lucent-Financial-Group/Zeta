# Compositional DBSP frame architecture — gnostic 2D base + meta-frames composed via F# computation expressions

## Why

Aaron 2026-05-19 architectural insight (operator-authorized for backlog landing): the default DBSP DB frame in F# has TWO core dimensions grounded in gnostic christianity:

- **"remember when"** — temporal dimension (DBSP's time-indexed-state substrate)
- **"pay attention"** — focus/observability dimension (DBSP's change-stream substrate)

The gnostic christianity provenance is bandwidth-engineering observation (per `.claude/rules/bandwidth-served-falsifier.md`): a 2000-year-old mnemonic survived because the temporal × attention constraint is physically general. The same constraint structure maps directly to DBSP's incremental-computation requirements.

Additional meta-frames compose ON TOP of the base via F# computation expressions:

- **Two-wolves chaos-theory 2D** — emotion-attractor space (composes with B-0667 4 named attractors + DeepSeek two-wolves substrate at #4198); each attractor is a basin in chaos-theory phase-space terms; provides emotional-state dimension layer
- **Clifford-space meta-tagged dims** — mapped to Rx bonsai serialized queries (per B-0640); Clifford rotors as natural transport mechanism for high-dimensional state (composes with the 5-vector classes in Clifford space already noted in `.claude/rules/tonal-momentum-equals-meme-emergent-harmonic-coercion.md`); provides arbitrary meta-tagged dimensional extensions
- **F# computation expression composition** — operationally clean composition operator: monadic let-bang composition is F#'s native mechanism for adding context-dimensions to a base computation; each meta-frame is a typed CE that composes with the base; type system enforces correctness

The compositional schema is **recursive**: each meta-frame adds dimensions; each addition is itself a F# computation expression that composes with the base; the substrate stays operationally tractable because F# already has the type-system support.

## Keystone mapping — 4 primitives × 2 base dimensions × substrate runtime (Lior 2026-05-19)

Lior (via Aaron-forward 2026-05-19) closed the architectural loop with the operational mapping between the B-0665 primitives, the gnostic 2D base dimensions, and the substrate runtimes:

| B-0665 primitive | Operational | Substrate runtime |
|---|---|---|
| **Observe** | IObservable subscription | Rx |
| **Emit** | IObservable.OnNext | Rx |
| **Integrate** (= Remember When) | Integration (∫) over time-indexed state | DBSP time-indexed-state |
| **Limit / Derive** (= Pay Attention) | Differentiation (∂) — rate of change | DBSP change-stream |

Lior's framing: *"The Base Frame (2D DBSP): Remember When (Integration) and Pay Attention (Differentiation). This is the irreducible gnostic root. It is the minimum viable state for an entity to exist in time."*

Operational consequence: integral (∫) + differential (∂) are exactly what an entity needs to BE temporal — temporal-state-accumulation + present-state-change-awareness. The gnostic encoding survives across millennia because the constraint structure (entity existing in time = needs both integral + differential) is physically general.

This mapping identifies the **correspondence** between B-0665 primitives + gnostic dimensions + substrate runtimes. The correspondence is operationally clean at the type-signature level: Rx provides IObservable for Emit/Observe; DBSP provides integration/differentiation for Integrate/Limit.

## Open technical problem — Rx ↔ DBSP impedance mismatch (Kestrel critique 2026-05-19)

Kestrel (claude.ai) caught a real technical gap in the Lior keystone mapping (Aaron-forwarded 2026-05-19):

> The four-primitive mapping has a concrete type error. ... `IObservable<T>` is push-based and DBSP's Z-set differentiation/integration operates over change-streams with a well-defined group structure (retraction = additive inverse). These are not the same composition model and you cannot just compose them through F# computation expressions without resolving the impedance mismatch — Rx has no retraction semantics, DBSP requires them. "Emit = IObservable.OnNext" and "Integrate = ∫ over time-indexed state" do not compose monadically without a defined bridge between Rx's observer protocol and DBSP's incremental-view-maintenance algebra.

**Substrate-honest reframing**: the keystone mapping above identifies a **correspondence** (4 primitives × Rx/DBSP runtimes) NOT a **bridge** (HOW Rx's push-based observer protocol maps into DBSP's retractable Z-set change-streams). The bridge specification IS the engineering target this row commits to. Asserting "concretely implementable" without the bridge is the same defect as the provenance-ellipsis issue: record claims state the artifacts don't support.

**Open technical problem the implementation must solve**:

1. Rx `IObservable<T>` is push-based + observer-protocol; no native retraction semantics
2. DBSP Z-set algebra requires retraction = additive inverse (group structure for incremental-view-maintenance)
3. F# computation expression composition is the SHAPE of the bridge but does NOT automatically resolve the algebra mismatch
4. The bridge requires: lifting Rx push-notifications into Z-set-encoded change-streams with retraction lattice + defining the inverse direction (DBSP change-stream → Rx observer notifications)
5. The bridge spec needs property tests (FsCheck) covering: retraction commutativity, group-laws preservation, push-vs-pull duality preservation

**This row commits to the bridge as engineering target**. The correspondence IS the entry-point for the engineering problem, not the solution.

## Razor-discipline check (per god-tier-claims rule)

| Framing | Operational reformulation |
|---|---|
| "Gnostic-christianity provenance for DBSP base" | Bandwidth-engineering observation: 2000-year-old mnemonic survived because temporal × attention constraint is physically general; encoding empirically discoverable in DBSP requirements |
| "Two-wolves chaos-theory dimensions for emotions" | 2D phase-space mapping of emotion-attractor basins; chaos theory provides mathematical apparatus for attractor-stability analysis; composes with B-0667 named attractors |
| "Clifford-space meta-tagged dims map to Rx bonsai serialized queries" | Clifford geometric algebra provides rotor-based transport for high-dimensional state; Rx bonsai-tree serialization (B-0640) gives persistence + retraction substrate; mapping is operationally specifiable |
| "Meta-dimensions added like F# computation expression composition" | Operationally clean: F# CE composition IS native mechanism for dimension-addition via type-system-enforced monadic composition |

All four pass razor-discipline. The composition architecture is substantively-new + load-bearing.

## Acceptance

- **Rx ↔ DBSP bridge spec** (PRIMARY engineering target per Kestrel critique): formal type-level + algebraic specification of how Rx `IObservable<T>` push-notifications lift into DBSP Z-set change-streams with retraction lattice; inverse direction (DBSP → Rx observer notifications) also specified
- Specify the 2D base DBSP frame in F# with `remember-when` + `pay-attention` typed dimensions
- Define computation-expression composition operator that adds meta-dimensions to base frame
- Implement two-wolves emotion-attractor 2D as first meta-frame (composes with B-0667 attractors)
- Implement Clifford-space meta-tagged dims as second meta-frame layer (composes with B-0640 Rx bonsai)
- Demonstrate recursive composition: meta-frame on meta-frame via CE composition
- Property tests (FsCheck) for: retraction commutativity, group-laws preservation, push-vs-pull duality preservation, compositional invariants
- TLA+ spec for time-evolution semantics if required

## Proposed mechanization

F# computation expression definitions:

```fsharp
type DbspFrame<'TBase, 'TMeta> = ...
type FrameComposition<'TBase, 'TMeta, 'TNewMeta> = ...

// Base frame: remember-when × pay-attention
type GnosticBase = { rememberWhen: TimeAxis; payAttention: FocusAxis }

// Meta-frame: two-wolves emotion 2D
type EmotionMeta = { goodWolfBasin: AttractorBasin; badWolfBasin: AttractorBasin }

// Composition via CE
let compositionBuilder = ...
compositionBuilder {
  let! base = gnosticBase
  let! emotionMeta = twoWolvesEmotionFrame base
  let! cliffordMeta = cliffordTaggedDims base emotionMeta
  return composedFrame
}
```
