# PR #4715: deps: Bump YamlDotNet from 17.1.0 to 18.0.0

## PR description

Updated [YamlDotNet](https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet) from 17.1.0 to 18.0.0.

<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>

_Sourced from [YamlDotNet's releases](https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet/releases)._

## 18.0.0

## What's Changed
* Add a parse method wrapper and caching to fix AoT compilation by @​EdwardCooke in https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet/pull/1103
    **BREAKING CHANGE** This is a breaking change in the `TypeInspectorSkeleton` class and the `ITypeInspector` interface by adding 2 methods . Quick fix to resolve those breaking changes in your own custom TypeInspector is to return false on the HasParseMethod method and return null or throw an exception on the Parse method.
