# PR #4461: shard(2026-05-21/0059Z): cold-boot + 51-min canary-saturation wait close

## PR description

## Summary

- Fresh-session Otto-CLI cold-boot at 0008Z under stale contested root + Lior-canary saturation (3 procs; PID 49239 burning Gemini-3.1-pro `--yolo` for ~76 min)
- 51-min bounded wait (brief-ack counter #1 → #6 → past recursion-termination) until Lior cleared at 0059Z
- Adds new empirical anchor for [`holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure.md`](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/blob/main/.claude/rules/holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure.md): **cycle-1 forced-#6 bottoms out at minimal-acknowledgment when canary saturation co-blocks the meta-decomposition path itself** (rule-edit requires worktree creation, which the canary blocks)
- Carries forward orphaned `otto/2012z-...` triage (HC-8 NCI + Agora V6 constitution + Mirror/Beacon — 5 unmerged commits from 2026-05-18) as deferred next-cycle work

## Pull request overview

Adds a new hygiene-history tick shard documenting the 2026-05-21 0059Z tick (fresh-session cold-boot + bounded wait until canary-saturation cleared), and records a new empirical anchor about forced-#6 behavior when the rule-edit/meta-decomposition path is itself blocked.

**Changes:**
- Add a new tick shard file under `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/21/` capturing refresh observations, the bounded wait timeline, and carry-forward notes.
- Cross-link the shard to relevant `.claude/rules/*` and canonical tick-discipline docs using the 6-up relative-path convention.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/21/0059Z.md:7 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-21T01:16:00Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Fix incorrect elapsed-gap calculation from prior shard**

The stated `~33h gap` is inconsistent with the timestamps in the same sentence (`2026-05-20 1807Z` to `2026-05-21 0008Z` is about 6 hours). Because these tick shards are used as empirical timeline anchors, this arithmetic error can skew cadence/idle-window interpretation in later analysis and should be corrected to the actual duration.

### Thread 2: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/21/0059Z.md:16 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-21T01:16:00Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Use one consistent stash count for contested-root state**

This row reports `311 mods + 5 stashes`, but the same shard records `52 stashes` elsewhere (intro and empirical-anchor narrative). The conflicting counts make the contention severity non-reproducible for anyone replaying this tick and weaken the reliability of the claimed canary-saturation conditions; align all sections to the same measured value.

### Thread 3: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/21/0059Z.md:16 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-21T01:16:36Z):

The contested-root stash count is inconsistent within this shard: the narrative says "52 stashes accumulated" (line 7) and later repeats "52 stashes" (line 46), but this table row says "5 stashes". Please reconcile to a single correct number so readers don’t get conflicting operational state.
