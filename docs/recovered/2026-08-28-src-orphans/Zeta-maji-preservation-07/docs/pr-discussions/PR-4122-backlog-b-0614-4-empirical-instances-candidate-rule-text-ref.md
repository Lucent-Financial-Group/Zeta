# PR #4122: backlog(B-0614): 4 empirical instances + candidate rule-text refinement (forced-#6 recursive #2)

## PR description

Updates [B-0614](docs/backlog/P3/B-0614-investigate-forced-6-meta-fallback-edge-case-post-cycle-close-2026-05-17.md) with the empirical-instances-accumulated table:

| # | Tick | Substrate produced |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 22:13Z (this session) | [PR #4110](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4110) saturation anchor |
| 2 | 22:07Z (peer Otto session) | [PR #4118](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4118) cross-axis composition |
| 3 | 22:46Z (this session, recursive #1) | [PR #4120](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4120) B-0614 row creation |
| 4 | 23:03Z (this session, recursive #2) | THIS PR |

**Same-session frequency**: 3 instances in ~50 min once post-cycle-close.
**Cross-session**: peer Otto independently produced complementary substrate at the same hour.

Acceptance criterion #1 met (2-3 additional instances documented; 4 captured total).

Drafts a **candidate rule-text refinement** in B-0614 (NOT yet applied to the rule itself) replacing the current "ALWAYS works at #6" claim with "USUALLY works + exception for post-cycle-close saturation: file edge-case row." The refinement requires at least 1 cross-INSTANCE evidence beyond this session (different Otto identity, different machine) before landing — same-session evidence alone conflates "the pattern" with "this Otto's Pure-git-tier behavior."

This PR is itself instance #4 (recursive-meta-substrate by design): the row documenting the pattern is being extended BY the pattern recurring on it.

PR opened via REST endpoint (GraphQL exhausted, Pure-git tier still active).

## Pull request overview

Updates backlog row **B-0614** to record additional empirical evidence of the forced-#6 “dry meta-fallback” edge case and to draft (but not apply) a candidate refinement to the related rule text.

**Changes:**
- Adds an “Empirical instances accumulated” table plus same-session / cross-session observations.
- Marks acceptance criterion #1 as completed based on the newly captured instances.
- Drafts candidate rule-text refinement language (explicitly not yet applied).

* The draft refinement says “Do NOT land this refinement until at least 1 cross-instance evidence accumulates…”, but the table/paragraph above already records a cross-session instance (#2). Either clarify why #2 doesn’t satisfy the bar (e.g., cross-machine verification) or update the gating sentence so it remains consistent with the evidence listed.

> If you find yourself paralyzed about what to pick — pick THIS rule (or its analog for whatever failure mode is recurring) and sharpen it based on the current session's evidence. That's the meta-decomposition move that USUALLY works because the empirical evidence is the current session's behavior. **Exception** (per B-0614): when the session is post-cycle-close AND the substrate-pool is genuinely saturated (the meta-fallback would produce a recursive-anchor / memo-of-memos / re-statement-with-different-phrasing), the substrate-honest move is to file a small backlog row capturing the edge case AND/OR update an existing edge-case row with the current instance's data. The row IS the forced-#6 concrete artifact.

Do NOT land this refinement until at least 1 cross-instance evidence accumulates (different Otto identity, different session, different machine) — same-session evidence alone is insufficient to motivate a rule edit because it conflates "the pattern" with "this Otto's behavior under Pure-git tier."

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/backlog/P3/B-0614-investigate-forced-6-meta-fallback-edge-case-post-cycle-close-2026-05-17.md:73 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-17T23:09:34Z):

The new “Empirical instances accumulated” numbering isn’t chronological: instance #2 (22:07Z) predates #1 (22:13Z). Consider reordering/renumbering by tick time (or explicitly state the ordering rule) to avoid confusion when reading the evidence chain.

### Thread 2: docs/backlog/P3/B-0614-investigate-forced-6-meta-fallback-edge-case-post-cycle-close-2026-05-17.md:66 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-17T23:09:34Z):

This row’s body earlier describes it as “(P4)”, but the file is now clearly a P3 row (path + frontmatter). Please update the earlier narrative to match the current priority so the row doesn’t contradict itself.

This issue also appears on line 89 of the same file.
