## P0 — next round (committed)

- [x] ✅ **Fix SpeculativeWatermark retraction-native logic** — harsh-
  critic round #5 (shipped round 17: swapped direction check so
  late positive inserts trigger retract-of-old + insert-of-corrected).
- [x] ✅ **Fix ClosurePair Equals/GetHashCode mismatch** — harsh-critic
  #11 (shipped round 17: both Equals and GetHashCode now use
  `EqualityComparer<'N>.Default`).
- [x] ✅ **Fix `RecursiveSemiNaive` monotonicity violation in Hierarchy**
  — harsh-critic #2 (shipped round 17: `ClosureTable` now uses
  retraction-safe `Recursive` combinator; `RecursiveSemiNaive`'s
  monotonicity precondition is documented in its XML doc).
- [x] ✅ **Residual.fs rebuildFromIntegrated is O(n), not O(1)** —
  harsh-critic #3 (shipped round 17: rewritten with `SortedSet` +
  `Dictionary` so every op is honestly O(log k); no more fallback
  scan).
- [x] ✅ **Residuated.fs integrated Z-set grows unbounded** — harsh-
  critic #4 (shipped round 17: state is now (SortedSet, Dictionary)
  pair, both tracking only active keys — no more unbounded
  integrated history).
- [x] ✅ **FastCdc.fs O(n²) buffer scan** — harsh-critic #7 (shipped
  round 17: added persistent `scanCursor` + `hash` state; each byte
  hashed exactly once across lifetime).
- [x] ✅ **FastCdc.fs allocation-per-chunk** — harsh-critic #8 (shipped
  round 17: `Buffer.BlockCopy` instead of byte-by-byte loop; raw
  `byte[]` buffer with head/tail pointers replaces `ResizeArray`).
- [x] ✅ **Ship tests for Hierarchy/FastCdc/Merkle/ResidualMax/BloomFilter**
  — harsh-critic #28 (shipped round 17: 22 new tests in
  `Round17Tests.fs`; total suite 471 passing).
- [ ] **Witness-Durable Commit mode** — skeleton shipped round 17
  (`src/Core/Durability.fs` DU + `WitnessDurableBackingStore`
  placeholder). Full protocol impl blocked on the WDC paper peer-
  review rebuttal; see `docs/papers/WDC-rebuttal.md`.
- [ ] **SpeculativeWindow test coverage** — still pending; covered by
  SpeculativeWatermark tests in `Round17Tests.fs` but the
  `Window.fs` speculative path has no direct test.
- [ ] **ArrowInt64Serializer tests** — still pending; harsh-critic
  #28 remainder.

## Research projects

- [ ] **Retraction-safe semi-naïve LFP — gap-monotone variant**.
  `docs/research/retraction-safe-semi-naive.md`. Top-2 candidates:
  (1) signed-delta ("gap-monotone") — 10-14 engineer-days, needs a
  ~200-line TLA+ spec + TLC model-check + `RecursiveSignedSemiNaive`
  impl + Z-linearity guard + regression oracle. (2) Gupta-Mumick
  counting algorithm — 8-12d, simpler TLA+ proof, also unlocks
  path-counting / provenance-weight queries. Shares ~50% code with
  (1). Plan: ship (2) first as `CountingClosureTable`, land (1)
  after as `RecursiveSignedSemiNaive`. Promotes `ClosureTable` off
  the current O(|integrated closure|) per-iteration fallback.
- [ ] **CQF (Counting Quotient Filter) trial** to replace the
  4-bit counting Bloom saturation issue. Pandey et al. SIGMOD'17.
  Our `CountingBloomFilter` saturates at 15; CQF uses
  variable-width counters (grows into empty slots). Port effort:
  5-8d. Includes: trial port, benchmark vs current counting
  Bloom, round-18 TECH-RADAR promotion if it wins.
- [ ] **Ceramist → Lean Mathlib port of probability lemmas**.
  Ceramist is the only existing formal-proof corpus for AMQ
  correctness (Coq, ITP'20 / CAV'21). Port the counting-Bloom
  soundness lemma to `proofs/lean/BloomFilter.lean`. Effort:
  2-3 weeks (mostly Mathlib onboarding).
- [ ] **Finish Lean 4 + Mathlib chain-rule proof**.
  `proofs/lean/ChainRule.lean` is a `sorry`-bodied stub.
  `docs/research/proof-tool-coverage.md` is explicit this is the
  single highest-leverage prover move we can make. 2 weeks.
- [ ] **LiquidF# refinement-types trial**. Would catch the
  off-by-one / bad-index class that keeps reappearing in
  `FastCdc.fs`, `Crdt.fs`, SIMD merge. Effort: 1 week for
  evaluation, then incremental adoption per module.
- [ ] **Feldera apples-to-apples benchmark**. Three concrete
  steps from `docs/research/feldera-comparison-status.md`:
  (a) `cargo build --release` in `references/upstreams/feldera/`,
  (b) write `bench/Dbsp.Feldera.Bench/FelderaRunner.fs` shell-out
  helper + `FelderaCompare.fs` diff harness,
  (c) port Nexmark Q3 (hash join) + Q7 (windowed top-1) on our
  side (Window.fs wiring pending). Target: measured numbers in
  `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` by end of round 20.

## P0 — security / SDL artifacts

- [ ] **`docs/security/CRYPTO.md`** — justify CRC32C (integrity, not
  auth) vs SHA-256 (future roadmap for tamper-evident checkpoint
  manifests).
- [x] ✅ **5 new Semgrep rules** (SDL-derived): unchecked deserialization,
  `File.ReadAllBytes` on user path w/o size cap, `Process.Start`,
  `Activator.CreateInstance` from untrusted type string,
  `System.Random` in security context. Shipped round 17 as rules
  8-12 in `.semgrep.yml`.
- [ ] **CodeQL workflow** — `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`, SDL
  practice #9.
- [ ] **pytm threat model** — `docs/security/pytm/threatmodel.py`
  replaces markdown-only threat-model as authoritative source.

## P1 — within 2-3 rounds

- [ ] **Software-factory design — roles vs personas vs
  skills architecture.** This is foundational work on the
  Zeta software-factory pattern, not just on one repo's
  agent layout. Everything we ship here informs the
  factory-paper deliverable
  (`docs/research/factory-paper-2026-04.md`) and the
  competitive analysis against MetaGPT / ChatDev /
  AutoGen / CAMEL / SWE-Agent / AutoCodeRover.

  Aaron round-27: "this project needs certain roles but
  any agent can satisfy the role and move around over
  time. So we have named agents, who have unique personas
  and are assigned to a role, skills can be assigned to
  the persona or the role because certain roles will
  require a skill."

  Current state conflates all three: `.claude/agents/<role>.md`
  filenames are role-keyed, persona names live inside the
  file (Kenji = architect), skill assignments are in the
  frontmatter of the persona file. A persona cannot be
  reassigned to a different role without renaming files;
  a role cannot exist without a persona filling it; role-
  level skill requirements cannot be expressed separately
  from the persona's own capabilities. Every other AI
  factory system we have surveyed has a variant of this
  conflation — resolving it cleanly is a real research
  contribution, not just plumbing.

  **Design targets** (open questions, not decisions):
  - **Separation of concerns.** Role = requirement
    (what the seat needs to do). Persona = named agent
    with unique voice / stance / memory (who is doing
    it). Skill = capability, attachable to either.
  - **Dynamic assignment.** A persona moves between
    roles across rounds. Roles may be temporarily
    vacant. Multiple personas can share a role if the
    role is plural (e.g. two reviewers).
  - **Skill attachment.** Some skills attach to roles
    (every architect needs `round-management`); some to
    personas (Kenji personally carries `holistic-view`);
    some to both. Frontmatter schema needs to
    distinguish.
  - **File-system layout.** Candidate:
    `.claude/roles/<role>.md` (requirements) +
    `.claude/personas/<persona-name>.md` (individuals) +
    an assignments manifest. Persona memory already at
    `memory/persona/<persona-name>/` post-round-27,
    so that side is aligned.
  - **Backward compatibility.** Pre-v1 repo; breaking
    changes are cheap. Migration is mostly renaming
    files and updating cross-refs.

  **Prior art to survey** (research before design):

  *AI / software-factory systems:*
  - **MetaGPT** (Hong et al. 2023) — SOPs and role
    assignment for Product Manager / Architect /
    Engineer / QA Engineer.
  - **ChatDev** (Qian et al. 2023) — "software
    development virtual company" with role-scoped
    phases.
  - **AutoGen** (Microsoft 2023) — multi-agent
    conversation patterns; agent-type vs agent-instance
    distinction.
  - **CAMEL** (Li et al. 2023) — role-playing
    user-agent / assistant-agent framework.
  - **SWE-Agent** (Yang et al. 2024) — agent-computer
    interface; roles implicit in tools rather than
    personas.
  - **AutoCodeRover** (Zhang et al. 2024) — specialised
    agents for reproduce / locate / fix cycle.

  *General role-separation patterns:*
  - **IFS (Internal Family Systems)** — Self / Parts /
    Roles; loosely borrowed in
    `docs/PROJECT-EMPATHY.md`.
  - **DCI (Data-Context-Interaction)** — Reenskaug's
    pattern separating role-playing from object
    identity. Smalltalk / Ruby communities.
  - **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** — principals /
    roles / permissions; NIST RBAC model.
  - **Agile ceremonies** — Product Owner / Scrum Master
    / Developer are roles; people rotate through them.
    Scrum Guide separation is useful precedent.
  - **RACI matrices** — Responsible / Accountable /
    Consulted / Informed as role-assignment primitive.
  - **Theater / improv troupes** — actor vs character
    vs role. Understudy patterns. Ensemble casting.
  - **Military rank / role / individual** — three-level
    separation with mutual independence.
  - **DCR graphs** (Hildebrandt et al.) — formal role
    semantics for workflows.

  **Deliverable:** `docs/research/factory-roles-design.md`
  (note: factory-level, not Zeta-repo-level) with:
  - Prior-art survey: 1-2 paragraphs per candidate above,
    grouped by AI-factory systems vs general role
    patterns.
  - Chosen model with justification (drawing from the
    best parts of the prior art).
  - Concrete schema: frontmatter shape for roles /
    personas / skills; file-system layout; assignment
    manifest format.
  - Migration path for the current 25-seat roster.
  - Publication hook: how this design differentiates
    Zeta's factory from MetaGPT / ChatDev et al.,
    feeding the factory-paper draft.

  Land the design first; migration is its own round.

  **Why P1 rather than P2:** every persona decision
  (spawn / retire / reassign) currently re-opens this
  question. Resolving the model makes round 28+ roster
  decisions proceed without relitigating the shape each
  time, and gives the factory-paper a concrete
  contribution to point at.

- [ ] **Wire HLL from `Sketch.fs` into `Plan.estimate`** (query-planner
  P1, Imani). `src/Core/Plan.fs:28-51` currently uses static
  heuristics (filter /2, groupBy /4, 1024L unknown); real per-input
  cardinality needs `HyperLogLog` sketches per input stream plugged
  into the `inputRows` array path. Research context:
  `docs/research/proof-tool-coverage.md` (sketch-accuracy bounds).
  The current docstring is honest about the gap; this item is the
  wiring work itself.
- [ ] Port the CommitBoundary + frame-first/header-second protocol
  into `DiskSpine.fs` (3 P0 items from a prior deep-review)
- [ ] `ISimulationDriver` unification (VT scheduler + ChaosEnv +
  ISimulatedFs) — captured in `docs/FOUNDATIONDB-DST.md`
- [ ] Content-addressed batches — wire `MerkleHash` through Spine
  to replace `nextId`
- [ ] TLA `.cfg` for remaining 4 specs (ChaosEnvDeterminism,
  ConsistentHashRebalance, DictionaryStripedCAS,
  AsyncStreamEnumerator, SpineMergeInvariants-fix)
- [ ] `Dbsp.LearnedPlan` project — ML.NET AutoML → ONNX Runtime
  scoring (round-12 agent design); full design review first
- [ ] MI-optimal partition from arXiv:2402.13264 §4 (stronger than
  current greedy 2-approx)
- [x] ✅ Beam ACC/DISC/RET mode-collapse property tests — shipped
  round 17 in `Round17Tests.fs` (aggregate-under-mode simulator +
  direct Z-set retract-reinsert test).
- [ ] `github-pr-review-hygiene` skill to port in from prior
  research (no DBSP equivalent yet)
- [ ] Arrow IPC direct-write path — harsh-critic #15, eliminate the
  three-copy `MemoryStream → ToArray → CopyTo` dance
- [ ] Bayesian alpha ≤ 1 guard + tests for VarianceOfMean edge case
  (harsh-critic #19)
- [x] ✅ Upstream-list adoption as `docs/UPSTREAM-LIST.md` —
  shipped round 17.
- [ ] **Empathy-coach persona — IFS empathy-file keeper
  (title and name pending).** A persona whose job is to keep
  the IFS (Internal Family Systems) empathy files updated.
  Any persona can dispatch to this seat for friction or
  stuck-feeling surfacing; the seat can proactively reach
  into any persona's notebook to update empathy-file entries.
  **Do not label this persona "therapist", "counselor",
  "psychologist", or any regulated clinical title** — AI
  calling itself a regulated clinical role is legally
  hazardous. Safer candidates: *empathy coach*, *integration
  coach*, *relational steward*, *culture keeper*, *self-work
  steward* (IFS-native — "Self" is the integrating
  consciousness, not a clinical term).
  Scope: holds `docs/PROJECT-EMPATHY.md` as the working
  artifact. Relates to GOVERNANCE.md §17 (productive friction) —
  this seat sits *with* the friction rather than resolving
  it. Open design questions: (a) title (see safer candidates
  above), (b) personal name, (c) per-persona coaching-log vs
  shared log, (d) edit rights on `docs/PROJECT-EMPATHY.md`
  and per-persona notebooks, (e) cadence — round-close sweep
  vs on-demand only. Kenji + Daya pair on design; Daya's AX
  lens matters because wake-up cost for this seat needs to
  stay low (invoked from many contexts).

- [ ] **Dedicated agent-memory system (two-layer).** Two
  layers of memory, both off the main docs tree so agents
  stop writing history everywhere trying to save memories:
  (a) **shared** — cross-cutting facts / rules / lessons
  that apply to every persona. Lives at
  `memory/` (outside git,
  project-wide, Claude's auto-memory folder).
  (b) **per-persona** — each seat's unique lens, style,
  and working notes (e.g. Daya's cold-start audit
  heuristics, Viktor's overlay discipline). Lives at
  `memory/persona/<persona>.md` (in git when git lands;
  3000-word cap; ASCII-only). Per-persona memory is
  essential — if every seat shares every memory, all seats
  collapse to a single averaged voice. Design work: codify
  the layering as a GLOSSARY.md canon entry, formalise
  write-rules (which layer takes which kind of memory),
  ensure personas read their own notebook BEFORE any shared
  memory so individual voice dominates over averaged voice.
  Also handle: agents without a canonical write target
  invent random ones, so the two target paths must be
  discoverable from cold start. Pairs: Kenji + Daya.

## P1 — architectural hygiene

- [ ] **TLC-validation as a `dotnet test` target.** Every `.tla` spec
  under `docs/` should be TLC-exercised in CI so spec drift becomes a
  build break, not a quarterly rediscovery.
- [ ] **Roslyn / F# analyzer for blocking-wait patterns.** Ban
  `Task.Result`, `.Wait()`, and `GetAwaiter().GetResult()` on the
  production F#/C# surface. Currently caught by review; lift it into
  the build.
- [ ] **F#/Roslyn analyzer for mutable public setters on options/
  config/plan shapes.** Types like `*Options`, `*Plan`, `*Descriptor`
  should be init-only or immutable by construction. Reviewer catches
  it; promote to analyzer.
- [ ] **`coverage:collect` + `coverage:merge` entry points.** The
  `coverage-report/` folder is gitignored; current collection is
  ad-hoc per-dev. Land a reproducible Cobertura merge that the normal
  `dotnet test` run produces, with a loud-failure mode when a project
  stops emitting coverage artifacts.
- [ ] **Deterministic-path helper for tests needing filesystem
  uniqueness.** Replace any ad-hoc `Guid.NewGuid()` test-path noise
  with a process-local deterministic counter so reruns diff cleanly.
- [ ] **Typed optimistic-append outcomes on every `IAppendSink`.** The
  abstraction already distinguishes `AppendResult.Success` /
  `.Conflict`; make sure every new sink implementation preserves that
  shape rather than raising for the conflict case.
- [ ] **FASTER-style HybridLog region model for any future persistent
  state tier.** Memory / read-only / stable regions with explicit
  boundaries, instead of a single flat file with region pointers bolted
  on later.
- [ ] **Copy-reduction on the durable-commit path.** Batching and
  group-commit first, then measure before reaching for direct/unbuffered
  I/O or other exotic modes.

## P2 — research-grade

- [ ] **Witness-Durable Commit paper** — target ACM SoCC or VLDB
  industry; claim: buffered durable linearizability with
  O(root) sync bandwidth vs O(payload)
- [ ] **Closure-table over DBSP** — target ICDT/PODS; claim: first
  retraction-native incremental transitive closure with tropical-
  semiring shortest-path free variant
- [ ] **Retraction-native speculative watermark** — target DEBS/
  VLDB; claim: DBSP's retraction algebra subsumes Beam's ACC/
  DISC/RET modes as a single linear operator
- [ ] Lean 4 chain-rule proof with Mathlib (2-week effort)
- [ ] CAS-DBSP: FastCDC + Merkle + content-addressed batches as a
  unified paper (~VLDB 2026)
- [ ] ILP-relaxed MaxSAT spine scheduling with online warm-start
- [ ] Semiring-parametric Z-sets (tropical / Boolean / distributive
  lattice)
- [ ] Full `Zeta.Core.CSharp` shim with variance on every generic
  seam
- [ ] Sakana AI Scientist / Agent Laboratory investigation (limited
  trial, Lit-Review phase only)
- [ ] **Friendly-competition tracking** — systematic study of
  MetaGPT, ChatDev, AutoGen, CAMEL, SWE-agent, AutoCodeRover,
  Agentless as upstreams and references for the software-
  factory paper track. Goal: know which patterns we have that
  they don't, which we should steal, and which they've already
  published so our writeups cite honestly — studying the
  friendly competition is how we know whether our ideas are
  genuinely novel. Landing surface:
  `docs/research/friendly-competition.md`. Effort: 1 day
  initial survey + rolling updates on new paper drops. Wired
  into Jun (TECH-RADAR) for ring-assignment of each tool.

## P3 — noted, deferred

- TPM/Intel SGX hardware-attested commits

## ⏭️ Declined

- SQLite-derived on-disk format (per AGENTS.md greenfield policy)
