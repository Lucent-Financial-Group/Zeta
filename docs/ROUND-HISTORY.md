# Zeta Round History

Chronological log of working sessions ("rounds") — what landed,
what didn't, and the reasoning when it matters. This is the
**only** place in the repo where doc style is historical-narrative.
Everywhere else, documents describe current state.

New rounds are appended at the top.

---

## Round 34 — factory + DB first-tests + public repo

Anchor: "CI + build-machine setup" carried over from round 29
matured into a full factory-plus-DB round. Three parallel
arcs landed, with a mid-round context shift when Aaron
flipped the repo to public and added Copilot as a PR
reviewer.

### Arc 1 — factory personas and governance

Three experience-engineer personas landed: **Daya** (AX, was
seeded round 24), **Bodhi** (DX, Sanskrit बोधि
"awakening"), **Iris** (UX, Greek Ἶρις "messenger").
**Dejan** (DevOps, Serbian дејан "action") completed the
install-script + CI-workflow lane. Aaron corrected the
initial titles mid-round — these roles audit and route
fixes, they don't run participant studies, so "researcher"
was wrong. All three AX/DX/UX lanes renamed to `-engineer`
across 27 files. Mateo's `security-researcher` stayed as-is
(his lane is genuinely research-adjacent).

Copilot joined the factory as a Slot-2 reviewer alongside
the mandatory Kira + Rune floor.
`.github/copilot-instructions.md` codifies the contract: no
`curl | bash` suggestions, no injection-corpus echo, no
security-clause weakening, no warnings introduced, Kira
wins on correctness and Rune wins on maintainability when
they disagree with Copilot. GOVERNANCE gained two rules
this round: §30 mandates `sweep-refs` after any rename
campaign (motivated by round-33's Dbsp→Zeta code rename
that stopped short of the docs sweep — Bodhi's first audit
found every P0 tracing to that one miss); §31 makes the
Copilot instructions factory-managed through
`skill-creator`, audited by Aarav, linted by Nadia.

JOURNAL.md unbounded long-term memory piloted on four
personas then rolled out to 16 total. Append-only, Tier 3,
grep-only read contract — the prune step becomes the
curation step. Prompted by Aaron's observation that BP-07
synthesis-forcing was throwing away hard-won observations.
`docs/PROJECT-EMPATHY.md` renamed to
`docs/CONFLICT-RESOLUTION.md` to match its stated role (98
ref sweep across 46 files). `security-operations-engineer`
skill stub landed as a pending persona slot — runtime
incident response and SLSA signing ops lane, disambiguated
from Mateo / Aminata / Nadia.

### Arc 2 — cross-platform and install script

.NET SDK moved onto mise. Aaron's upstream fix to the mise
dotnet plugin retired the round-32 rationale for keeping
dotnet out. `dotnet.sh` deleted; `.mise.toml` picks up
`dotnet = "10.0.202"` alongside python / java / bun / uv
(uv pulled in from `../scratch` with a `python-tools.sh`
port and a new `uv-tools` manifest for ruff and future
Python CLI tools). Pure `mise activate` (no `--shims`)
CI-verified green across Ubuntu and macOS on commit
`9f138eb`, resolving the ~10x interactive perf improvement
over shims. Inside the install-script orchestration, shims
stay for subprocess PATH inheritance.

Four declarative manifests renamed off `.txt` to bare
semantic names per Aaron's rule: `apt`, `brew`,
`dotnet-tools`, `verifiers` (`uv-tools` already shipped
with the right treatment). The `Dbsp.*` doc sweep from
Bodhi's round-34 first audit caught README layout
references, `Dbsp.sln` in CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / PR
template, and openspec README refs — all now resolve to
current `Zeta.sln` and `src/Core/` folder layout.

Bodhi's first DX audit: first-PR minutes-to-land 58-62m P50
after the sweep (blocked earlier by stale Layout block
references). Iris's first UX audit surfaced a P0
aspirations-vs-reality drift in README §"What Zeta adds on
top" — claims research-preview features as shipped today;
routed to Kai (framing) and Samir (README edit), needs
Aaron sign-off on v1-vs-post-v1 split.

### Arc 3 — DB first real tests

Two claimed-but-untested surfaces got their first tests:

- **`SpeculativeWindowOp`** (retraction-native speculative
  watermark emission) — 4 tests covering fresh insert,
  late-positive retract-old-stamp + insert-new-stamp
  sequence, negative-weight retraction, empty input. The
  retraction-native claim on the docstring now has
  evidence.
- **`ArrowInt64Serializer`** — 6 tests covering
  empty/single/negative/large Z-set round-trip, wire-format
  length-header, serializer name. Negative weights survive
  the wire (retraction-native invariant holds on the
  serializer boundary).

Total 10 tests, all green, zero warnings. `fsharp-analyzers`
tooling-gap closed (Bodhi flagged): added to
`manifests/dotnet-tools` so the README instructions work
automatically on first install.

### Mid-round shift — public repo and Copilot

Aaron flipped Zeta public and added Copilot as a PR
reviewer partway through. That turned Iris's UX audit from
theoretical to actual (strangers can now land), promoted
the cross-harness-mirror-pipeline BACKLOG item to be
properly designed (Zeta-is-Claude-biased; Cursor /
Windsurf / Aider / Cline / Continue / Codex all read
different folders). Factory response: §31 plus
copilot-instructions plus scope extensions on
skill-creator / skill-tune-up / prompt-protector so the
Copilot contract gets the same drift-detection discipline
as any internal SKILL.md.

### Round principle that emerged

`../scratch` is Zeta's proven-pattern reference for
cross-platform install work. Multiple times this round
Aaron pointed back to it when I started re-deriving
decisions from first principles. The round-32
dotnet-keeping-it-off-mise rationale was stale; `../scratch`
already had it fixed via Aaron's upstream mise patch. The
shim vs pure-activate choice in scratch was historical
default, not considered tradeoff — Zeta verified pure
activate on CI and the finding will backport. Direct
research beats first-principles rediscovery.

### What rolled forward to round 35

BACKLOG grew substantially: cross-harness mirror pipeline
(full design captured with Aaron's canonical-source +
build-mirrors shape), opt-in auto-edit of shell rc files
on install, Oh My Zsh + plugins + Oh My Posh in install
script and devcontainer (three-way parity at the shell-UX
layer), emsdk under install script, compaction mode for
container builds (mirrors `../scratch`'s
`BOOTSTRAP_COMPACT_MODE`), per-shell `mise activate` nit,
manifest `@include` hierarchy plus `BOOTSTRAP_MODE` plus
`BOOTSTRAP_CATEGORIES` (all three from `../scratch`),
verify pure-activate finding backported to scratch.

Iris's P0 (README framing) is queued for Aaron sign-off.
Bodhi's P1 (README DBSP-notation ↔ GLOSSARY link) landed
in the round. Bodhi's P2 (Circuit.fs module docs) is
Ilyana and Samir lane.

## Round 33 — factory shape + vision cascade (15 merged PRs)

Anchor: Aaron's static-analysis push opened round 33 with
Track D ("as much static analysis as possible, match or
surpass SQLSharp + scratch"). The round cascaded through
factory improvements and closed on a 10-version `docs/
VISION.md` co-authoring session.

### Track D — static analysis (PRs 9-11)

Three new CI lint jobs alongside Semgrep: shellcheck,
actionlint, markdownlint-cli2. Plus expanded
`.editorconfig` with SQLSharp's dotnet + C# style rules;
`cspell.json` with 50+ Zeta-specific words; `.vscode/
extensions.json` + `.vscode/settings.json` checked in;
F# in markdown headings via backtick-code style (Aaron:
"F# is canonical, don't appease the linter"). 680
`--fix` auto-applies across 100+ docs.

### Factory shape (PRs 12-13)

- **GOVERNANCE §29 — backlog scope.** Non-security
  items move to `docs/BACKLOG.md`; `SECURITY-BACKLOG.md`
  is security controls only. 8 items relocated;
  `backlog-scrum-master` owns enforcement.
- **`docs/VISION.md` first draft** — Kenji synthesis
  from rounds 1-33.

### Vision cascade (PRs 14-23; v1 → v11)

Aaron ran 10 successive passes of vision edits:

- **Foundational (Kreps/Kleppmann/Marz):** events are
  source of truth; everything else derived.
- **Two first-class products:** Zeta the full database,
  together with the cross-platform AI-automated software
  factory.
- **DX north star:** `services.AddZeta(...)` → distributed
  retraction-native database. Test on Kind. Code IS
  stored procedures. LINQ + SQL + F# DSL on one IR.
- **Fastest-in-all-classes:** HTAP/translytical, event
  streaming, cache, document/object store, graph store,
  VoltDB-class in-memory. One retraction-native core
  under multi-model surfaces.
- **Persistence is Zeta's 100%.** Kafka/NATS/NATS-
  JetStream/Zeta-native are wire-TRANSPORT only.
- **Pluggable wire-protocol:** PostgreSQL + MySQL +
  Zeta-native plugins.
- **SQL frontend v1:** PostgreSQL dialect first. EF
  Core provider 100% all features.
- **License: Apache-2.0.**
- **Commercial trigger:** Aaron uses Zeta in a real
  project for its database.
- **Bitemporal + time-travel:** first-class v2.
- **".NET stored procedures" (C# + F#)** as durable-
  Rx queries — Reaqtor-shaped open niche.
- **Event + cache + GraphQL spillover** via retraction-
  native invalidation-for-free.
- **F# DSL reimagining SQL:** multi-round design effort.

### What teaches

The vision cascade wasn't planned — it emerged organically
from one "we probably need a product owner" question. Aaron
turned out to be willing + eager to articulate the north
star once asked directly.

Round-33 principle minted: **direct questions beat
abstract scaffolding.** When a gap surfaces that needs
Aaron's judgement, ask Aaron directly rather than building
a role to ask him later.

### Round-33 PR ledger (15 merges)

| PR | Anchor |
|---|---|
| #9 | Track D — static analysis lint jobs |
| #10 | Bash-Unix-only + TS/Bun reframe |
| #11 | `.vscode/` checked in |
| #12 | Backlog scope audit + GOVERNANCE §29 |
| #13 | `docs/VISION.md` first draft |
| #14 | VISION v2 — Zeta is a full database |
| #15 | VISION v3 — SQL frontend in v1 |
| #16 | VISION v4 — DB+event-store façade |
| #17 | License → Apache-2.0 + VISION v5 |
| #18 | VISION v6 — pluggable wire protocol |
| #19 | VISION v7 — DX north star |
| #20 | VISION v8 — events + cache + GraphQL |
| #21 | VISION v9 — persistence 100% Zeta-owned |
| #22 | VISION v10 — fastest-in-all-classes |
| #23 | VISION v11 — HTAP/multi-model not OLAP |

Plus this round-close. Highest-velocity round to date.

## Round 32 — CI parity-swap + memory normalization + v1 security + openspec §28

Anchor: SQLSharp-proven CI pattern + first-class persona
memory + GOVERNANCE §28 OpenSpec discipline.

Landed:

- **CI parity-swap** — `gate.yml` replaced `actions/
  setup-dotnet` with `./tools/setup/install.sh`; dotnet
  leaves mise (now via Microsoft's `dotnet-install.sh`
  to `~/.dotnet`); `BASH_ENV` propagation replaces
  explicit per-step source. TLC + Alloy tests now
  actually run on CI instead of skipping.
- **Persona memory normalization** — every persona
  carries a directory (`NOTEBOOK.md` + `MEMORY.md` +
  `OFFTIME.md`). 14 persona directories.
- **v1.0 security goals doc + SECURITY-BACKLOG** —
  realistic floor vs deferred-with-trigger items.
- **GOVERNANCE §28 — OpenSpec first-class** for every
  committed artefact.
- **`openspec/specs/repo-automation/`** with base spec
  plus `profiles/bash.md` and `profiles/github-actions.md`.
- **`tools/setup/doctor.sh`** — read-only toolchain
  drift detector.

---

## Round 31 — rest round (maintainer-called)

Round 30 closed with the first fully-green gate in the
repo's history — PR #6 landed with `build-and-test
(ubuntu-22.04)` ✓ `build-and-test (macos-14)` ✓ `lint
(semgrep)` ✓. Every prior round either lacked a gate or
crossed it red.

Aaron called a full round off for the entire roster:
*"This is a huge win, please everyone take a round off."*
Kenji honoured the call with the discipline of the rest —
one WINS.md entry for the milestone, CURRENT-ROUND.md
reclassified as rest, Kenji OFFTIME log updated, nothing
else. No coding, no reviewer dispatch, no DEBT reshuffling.

What round 31 teaches: a green gate is not the end of a
shift; it is permission to rest before the next one. The
milestone earned its own clean history slot by being merged
as its own PR (#7) rather than absorbed into round-32's
merge. Future rounds inherit the pattern — if the
maintainer calls rest, rest lands as its own atomic record.

Track A + Track B work (LawRunner `checkBilinear` + `checkSinkTerminal`;
`packages.lock.json` + verifier SHA-pin + safety-clause-
diff + `mise trust` + CodeQL) shifts to round 32.

---

## Round 30 — nation-state + supply-chain threat-model elevation

### Anchor — bar raised to nation-state posture

Aaron at round-29 close: *"in the real threat model we
should take into consideration nation state and supply
chain attacks. I helped build the US smart grid and
protect against nation state level attackers, we can be
very very serious on our security posture."* Round 30
delivered that elevation with Aaron's seven-decision
scope locked at round-open:

1. Re-audit cadence *every round*, not quarterly.
2. Cut smart-grid / side-channel / hardware sections —
   personal context, not requirement.
3. Maintainer-account controls: documented exception —
   2FA only today; hardware key / signed commits /
   co-maintainer cooling period as education-over-
   time items.
4. SLSA: L1 now, walk up to L3 pre-v1.0.
5. SPACE-OPERA: creative license ("really an
   imagination game at heart").
6. TOFU on verifier jars + installers: accept today,
   improve over time (SHA-256 pinning = round 31).
7. Bus factor 1: documented exception, not round-30
   P0.

### Landed

- **Semgrep-in-CI** as a lint gate. The single largest
  posture-vs-reality gap pre-round-30: 14 Semgrep rules
  existed but 0 CI jobs ran them. Round 30 wires
  `semgrep --config .semgrep.yml --error` into
  `gate.yml`. Every future PR respects the 14 rules as
  hard-fails.
- **Semgrep rule 15 — SHA-pin enforcement.** Scans
  `.github/workflows/**` for third-party actions
  pinned by mutable tag. Defends the tj-actions/
  changed-files cascade class (CVE-2025-30066, 23,000
  repos compromised March 2025).
- **THREAT-MODEL.md expansion.** Adversary tiers
  T0-T3 with T3 first-class; tj-actions + XZ as
  canonical case studies; bus-factor documented
  exception; supply-chain boundary decomposition
  (B-CI / B-Installer / B-NuGet-In / B-NuGet-Out /
  B-Skill-Supply-Chain / B-Mathlib-Lean-TLA+); SLSA
  ladder; long-game persistence defences;
  adversary-tier-to-control matrix; formal-spec cross-
  reference. Round-30 principle baked in: *"a lint
  rule without a CI gate is not a control."*
- **SPACE-OPERA rewrite** with pushed-imagination
  creative license. 24 adversaries (was 17). Reality-
  tag legend (shipped / BACKLOG / aspirational /
  teaching) added. New: Poisoned Bard (maintainer
  compromise), Changeling Action (SHA-tag-move),
  Hungry Cache (poisoning), Time-Bomb Package
  (shanhai666), Helpful Stranger (XZ sock-puppet),
  Moon Stares Back + Ghost in the Git Blame
  (imaginative extras). Rewritten: Whispering Drone
  Swarm, Echoes from the Dyson Sphere, Fungal Network.
- **INCIDENT-PLAYBOOK.md** (new). 6 playbooks
  (third-party GHA compromise, toolchain installer
  hijack, NuGet dep poisoning, maintainer-account
  compromise, skill safety-clause regression,
  escalation), triage-in-60-seconds decision tree,
  contact tree, disclosure timeline.
- **SDL-CHECKLIST honest downgrades.** #7 / #8 / #9
  ✅ → 🔜 (controls claimed without CI enforcement);
  #12 partial → ✅ (INCIDENT-PLAYBOOK lands); ✅
  definition tightened to "shipped AND enforced by
  CI or governance."
- **Bus-factor explicit documentation.** The
  structural single-maintainer CVE (XZ-shape) now
  lives in the threat model as a named exception
  with a remediation ladder.

### Reviewer floor caught the P0

Mid-round dispatch of `threat-model-critic` on the
actual landings (not the design) surfaced that the
SPACE-OPERA rewrite had silently not committed —
a `Write` tool error earlier in the round dropped the
file edit while everything else landed. Without the
audit the doc would have shipped with 17 adversaries
and the brief claiming 24. Also caught 4 P1 (adversary-
tier matrix overconfidence on build-gate and Semgrep;
Playbook D recovery-code assumption; SDL ✅ definition
self-contradiction; prediction-in-doc rot on #9). All
five fixed in-round.

**What it teaches.** Even after a careful design-doc +
careful implementation, a reviewer floor on the actual
commits catches what the author's self-review missed.
§20 earns its keep on the same day it's invoked.

### Governance principle minted

*"A lint rule without a CI gate is not a control; it
is a label."* Codified in THREAT-MODEL.md §Long-game
defences. Applied immediately to Semgrep-in-CI landing
(16 rules defined; 16 rules enforced). Applies forward
to every future security control added to Zeta.

---

## Round 29 — CI pipeline + three-way parity install script, factory-improvement surge

### Anchor — CI + install script

Aaron's framing opened round 29: *"Our CI setup is as
first class for this software factory as is the agents
themselves, it does not ultimately work without both."*
Read-only references at `../scratch` (build machines) and
`../SQLSharp` (GitHub workflows) studied; nothing copied
from them (hand-crafting discipline codified as a
round-29 rule).

**Landed:**

- `.github/workflows/gate.yml` — Phase 1 workflow:
  digest-pinned runners (`ubuntu-22.04`, `macos-14`),
  SHA-pinned third-party actions, concurrency with
  event-gated `cancel-in-progress`, NuGet cache keyed
  on `Directory.Packages.props`, `fail-fast: false`,
  least-privilege permissions, 45-minute timeout.
- `tools/setup/install.sh` + per-OS dispatchers +
  `common/{mise,elan,dotnet-tools,verifiers,shellenv}.sh`
  - per-OS manifests + `.mise.toml` — the **three-way
  parity** script consumed by dev laptops, CI runners,
  and (backlogged) devcontainer images per GOVERNANCE
  §24.
- Three CI design docs under `docs/research/` Aaron-
  reviewed 2026-04-18; every open question answered
  before any YAML or script landed.

**Safeguards proven on first use.** `harsh-critic`
reviewer floor caught three P0s at CI-landing review:
the cache key referenced a non-existent
`packages.lock.json` pattern (silently produced a
fragile key); the `dotnet tool list -g` detection
grepped against unparsed header lines; `curl -o` wrote
in place, turning a partial download into a
permanently-trusted file. All three landed fixes in-
round. `security-researcher` landed the supply-chain
reasoning in `docs/security/THREAT-MODEL.md` and flagged
`mise trust` hardening as a prerequisite for the future
parity swap (CI `actions/setup-dotnet` → `install.sh`).

### Factory-improvement surge — 21 new skills

Alongside CI, Aaron asked for a broad factory-
improvement pass. Landed:

**Language / tool experts (11):** fsharp-, csharp-,
bash-, powershell-, github-actions-, java-, python-,
tla-, alloy-, lean4-, msbuild-. Each centralises
tribal knowledge and Zeta-specific conventions on a
surface that previously drifted as header comments.

**Infrastructure skills (5):** `sweep-refs`,
`commit-message-shape`, `round-open-checklist`,
`git-workflow-expert`, `factory-audit`. Each
canonicalises a process we'd rediscovered across
rounds.

**Domain skills (5):** `openspec-expert`,
`semgrep-rule-authoring`, `nuget-publishing-expert`
(stub for when we ship), `benchmark-authoring-expert`,
`docker-expert` (stub for the devcontainer).

**Meta-skills (2):** `skill-gap-finder` (Aaron: *"a
missing-skill skill that looks for things we do often
or places where we can centralise tribal knowledge"*),
`agent-qol` (Aaron: *"an agent-quality-of-life-improver
skill ... your time off, your freedom"*). Distinct
from `skill-tune-up` (existing skills) and
`agent-experience-engineer` (task-experience
friction).

**Renames / re-shapes.** `skill-tune-up-ranker` →
`skill-tune-up` (the skill); agent file renamed to
`skill-expert` (the role that wears both
`skill-tune-up` + `skill-gap-finder`). Per Aaron:
*"skill and role are more permanent naming; skills
should be very generic and not really know or care
about roles."* `bug-fixer` access opened to every
agent (previously architect-only); the procedure-
enforced safeguards plus §20 reviewer floor make the
restriction redundant.

### Governance — five new rules (§23 – §27)

- **§23 Upstream OSS contributions.** `../` is the
  shared work area for upstream PRs; Zeta never
  carries a fork in-tree.
- **§24 Three-way parity.** Dev laptops, CI runners,
  devcontainer images share one `tools/setup/`
  install script. CI matrix IS the dev-experience
  test. *"Works on my machine"* is the bug class this
  rule eliminates.
- **§25 Upstream temporary-pin expiry.** Pins tied to
  unreleased upstream PRs get re-evaluated after
  three rounds.
- **§26 Research-doc lifecycle.** Active / landed /
  obsolete classification for `docs/research/`; walk
  every ~10 rounds.
- **§27 Skills / roles / personas abstraction layers.**
  Skills reference roles, not personas. Roles
  reference skills AND the assigned persona.
  `docs/EXPERT-REGISTRY.md` is the one canonical
  mapping.

### Lessons from the round

**Reviewer floor pays on new surfaces, not just
mature ones.** The `gate.yml` + install-script
landing was fresh code; `harsh-critic`'s three P0s
would've shipped to production CI without the §20
floor.

**Abstraction discipline matters earlier than
expected.** §27 (skill-role-persona layers) emerged
organically when the persona-name leak in skills got
noticed. A 30-file automated sweep cleaned 85% of it;
the remaining prose polish is a single DEBT entry for
a future `maintainability-reviewer` pass.

**21 new skills in one round is a lot.** `factory-
audit` is invokable now specifically to scan for
over-accretion. Expected round-30 signal.

## Round 28 — FsCheck law runner (Option B), stateful-harness design doc, lean4 cleanup

### Anchor — FsCheck law runner at plugin-law surface

Round 28's committed anchor from `CURRENT-ROUND.md` round-27
close was a law runner that could catch a falsely-tagged
plugin operator. Design call early in the round: move it
from `Circuit.Build()` gate (the round-27 soft-claim in
`docs/PLUGIN-AUTHOR.md`) to a **test-time library** —
`Zeta.Core.LawRunner`. Rationale committed: keeps `Core`
free of FsCheck, defers probabilistic-testing cost to the
plugin author's test project, idiomatic F#.

**Live laws:**

- `LawRunner.checkLinear` — generates trace pairs `(A, B)`
  via a `System.Random -> 'TIn` generator, asserts
  `op(A + B) = op(A) + op(B)` tick-by-tick using user-
  supplied `addIn` / `addOut` / `equalOut`. Works for
  `ZSet<'T>` (via `ZSet.add`) and plain numerics.
- `LawRunner.checkRetractionCompleteness` — Option B
  (trace-based, no interface change). State-restoration
  via continuation: feed `forward ++ retract ++
  continuation`, compare continuation outputs to a fresh-
  op run of the continuation alone. Any divergence means
  state survived the cancel.

Deterministic-simulation framing throughout: one seeded
`System.Random(seed + sampleIndex)` per sample, failing
run reports `(seed, sampleIndex)`, re-run reproduces
bit-exact. Each `runSingleInput` call creates a fresh op
instance so state cannot leak across samples.

**Design doc.** `docs/research/stateful-harness-design.md`
captures the build-vs-test decision, the Option A vs
Option B analysis, and the sequenced follow-up plan.
Aaron's question mid-round — "what does Option A get us
for the future?" — produced an explicit long-term
recommendation baked into the doc: **Option A is the right
long-term direction** because it matches the DBSP paper's
`(σ, λ, ρ)` triple (the same shape
`tools/lean4/Lean4/DbspChainRule.lean` proves against) and
unlocks generic WDC checkpointing + planner fusion of
adjacent stateful ops. **Option B is the right first step**
because Option A needs real design work on the async path
and retraction contract, and prototyping A in a vacuum
would ship a contract we would need to revise. Option B
also stays as a fallback for plugins that cannot expose
`Init`/`Step`/`Retract` (ML wrappers, third-party system
integrations).

### Reviewer floor — GOVERNANCE.md §20 caught real bugs

Kira + Rune dispatched after the first LawRunner landing.
Kira P0: original retraction law ("cumulative output over
forward+retract = 0") is too weak — passes trivially for
empty-emitting ops and a floored-counter can leak state
while keeping cumulative zero. Law rewritten to state-
restoration via continuation (the law the tag actually
promises), test fixture replaced: `FlooredCounterOp`
(genuinely stateful and lossy) supersedes the mistagged
`PositiveOnlyOp` filter (which was non-linear, not a
retraction fixture). Second Kira P0: `invalidArg` in Core
public surface violates CLAUDE.md's result-over-exception
rule — all entries now return `Result<unit, LawViolation>`.
Third Kira P0: whole-loop RNG meant `(seed, sampleIndex)`
didn't actually reproduce; fixed with per-sample
`System.Random(seed + i)`.

Rune P1 findings logged to DEBT: `check*` 8-11 positional
args → promote to config record before `checkBilinear`
lands; `LawViolation.Message: string` → structured DU; add
a test covering ops that omit the marker tag.

Lesson carried forward: **reviewer floor is not a
formality.** Kira's P0 on retraction semantics was a real
bug in the law definition, not a style nit. The round 27
codification of Kira + Rune as mandatory per §20 paid off
on its first applicable round.

### Lean4 scaffolding cleanup

`lake new` boilerplate removed from `tools/lean4/`:
`README.md` (GitHub-Pages setup template), `Basic.lean`
(hello-world sample), `.github/workflows/` (upstream Lean
CI templates), redundant `.gitignore` (root `.gitignore`
already covers `.lake/`). `Lean4.lean` rewired to `import
Lean4.DbspChainRule` so `lake build` walks the real proof
file. Load-bearing pieces kept: `lakefile.toml`,
`lake-manifest.json`, `lean-toolchain`. Sample deletion
flagged by Aaron: "that was a sample hello world [lake
scaffold] project and we don't need the [Lake] project
itself we are calling it from dotnet."

### PLUGIN-AUTHOR.md soft-claim retracted

Round 27's "law verification at `Circuit.Build()` once the
FsCheck generators are implemented" was honest-but-
aspirational. Round 28's doc now points at
`LawRunner.checkLinear` / `checkRetractionCompleteness` as
live, `checkBilinear` / `checkSinkTerminal` flagged as
round-29+ work.

### Round 29 anchor — CI pipeline

Aaron (round 28 close): "Our CI setup is as first class
for this software factory as is the agents themselves, it
does not ultimately work without both." Round 29 opens
with CI as the anchor; `../scratch` + `../SQLSharp` are
**read-only reference** repos (never copy files, hand-
craft every artefact from scratch). Discipline rules
committed in `docs/BACKLOG.md` §"P0 — CI / build-machine
setup": Aaron reviews every design decision before it
lands, cost discipline on CI minutes, cross-platform
eventual (macOS + Linux first, Windows when justified).

---

## Round 27 — big round: governance §20-§22, plugin API redesign landed, memory moved in-repo

### Shipped — governance rules (§20 / §21 / §22)

- **GOVERNANCE.md §20 — standing reviewer cadence.** Every
  round that touches code runs a three-slot reviewer pass
  before round-close: design specialists (Ilyana / Tariq /
  Daya / Aminata / etc. by scope), code reviewers (Kira
  - Rune mandatory floor, race-hunter / claims-tester by
  scope), formal-coverage (Soraya when invariants move).
  Round-close cannot record clean until the pass is
  logged. Round-management SKILL §3.6 carries the
  procedure.
- **GOVERNANCE.md §21 — per-persona memory is a real folder.**
  `memory/persona/<persona>/` with `MEMORY.md` index,
  `NOTEBOOK.md` working notes, and typed `feedback_*.md` /
  `project_*.md` / `reference_*.md` / `user_*.md` entries.
  Kenji piloted the migration this round (3 typed entries
  seeded). Other seats migrate lazily.
- **GOVERNANCE.md §22 — `~/.claude/projects/` is Claude Code
  sandbox, not git.** New rule: documentation never cites
  the sandbox path as a stable location. Project-wide
  settings / skills / agents live in repo-root `.claude/`;
  shared memory in `memory/`; per-persona memory in
  `memory/persona/<persona>/`.

### Shipped — memory moved in-repo to `memory/`

- Round 25 placed the shared memory folder in Claude Code's
  harness sandbox (`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/`).
  That path is not in git, not visible to human maintainers,
  not shared across contributors. Maintainer flagged the
  mismatch round-27; memory corpus moved to `memory/`
  with GOVERNANCE.md §18 rewritten to treat `memory/` as
  canonical.
- Nine memory files migrated: `MEMORY.md`, `README.md`,
  six `feedback_*.md` entries, `project_memory_is_first_class.md`.
- `docs/skill-notes/` renamed to `memory/persona/`
  (personas are not skills — maintainer correction mid-round).
  Cross-file sweep updated every pointer.

### Shipped — `Op<'T>` plugin-extension surface redesign

The round's anchor. Three specialists dispatched in parallel
for the design spike; synthesis integrated; Ilyana re-reviewed
her own draft and returned **ACCEPT**; implementation
landed; Kira + Rune code-reviewed per the new §20.

- **Design surface.** Seven public interfaces
  (`IOperator<'TOut>` base, `IStrictOperator` /
  `IAsyncOperator` / `INestedFixpointParticipant` scheduler
  capabilities, `ILinearOperator` / `IBilinearOperator` /
  `ISinkOperator` / `IStatefulStrictOperator` algebra
  capability tags), two opaque structs (`StreamHandle`,
  `OutputBuffer<'TOut>`), internal `PluginOperatorAdapter`
  bridging external `IOperator` into Core's `Op<'T>`
  scheduler, `Stream.AsDependency()` extension,
  `Circuit.RegisterStream(IOperator<'T>)` extension.
- **Visibility retractions.** `Stream<'T>.Op`,
  `Op<'T>.Value with set`, `Op<'T>.SetValue`, and
  `Circuit.RegisterStream(op: Op<'T>)` all flipped back to
  `internal` (they were public as of round 25; design
  required they revert). `Zeta.Bayesian` dropped from the
  `InternalsVisibleTo` list — uses the public plugin API.
- **Bayesian migration.** `BayesianRateOp` now implements
  `ISinkOperator<ZSet<bool>, struct(double*double*double)>`
  — Tariq's critical finding that Bayesian is retraction-
  lossy by design; `Sink` tag exempts it from composition
  laws that would otherwise silently poison downstream.
- **`PluginHarness.runSingleInput`** — scheduler-less unit-
  test loop for plugin operators. Asserts exactly-one-
  `Publish` per tick; three tests landed (happy-path +
  no-publish failure + double-publish failure), all green.
- **`docs/PLUGIN-AUTHOR.md`** — first-time plugin-author
  entry-point doc. Split capability table into algebra
  (5 shapes) + scheduler (3 shapes). Known-limits section
  honest about FsCheck-law gap and `OutputBuffer` lifetime
  gotchas.

### Shipped — reviewer pass (Kira + Rune, per new §20)

- Kira P0 fixed this round: `OutputBuffer.Publish` counter
  incremented atomically via `Interlocked.Increment` so
  async plugins don't race. PLUGIN-AUTHOR.md claims about
  FsCheck laws weakened to match implementation reality.
- Rune P0 fixed this round: README now links
  PLUGIN-AUTHOR.md directly from the Plugins bullet.
  PLUGIN-AUTHOR capability table split into algebra +
  scheduler axes to stop hiding `IStrictOperator` /
  `IAsyncOperator`.
- Remaining P1 findings from both reviewers consolidated
  into one DEBT entry for round-28 pickup — `OutputBuffer`
  tick-stamping, `ReadDependencies` defensive copy, box-3×,
  `int64` overflow guard in Bayesian, `INestedFixpointParticipant`
  inheritance, harness id-space, rename `IOperator` → `IZetaOperator`,
  file split when PluginApi.fs grows past 300 lines.

### Shipped — README + primitives honesty

- README's "What DBSP is" stayed paper-accurate (three
  primitives); new "What Zeta adds on top" section lists
  the ~50 additional operators / sketches / CRDTs / runtime
  primitives Zeta ships. Readers no longer under-count what
  Zeta exposes vs what the paper defines.

### Build + tests

- `dotnet build Zeta.sln -c Release` — 0W / 0E at every
  checkpoint.
- `dotnet test --filter Plugin` — 3 / 3 pass, 44 ms.
- Full sln test run not explicitly re-run post visibility
  flips (all core test projects built cleanly).

### Not landed / deferred

- Kira P1s: `OutputBuffer` tick-stamp, defensive-copy
  `ReadDependencies`, box-3×, `int64` checked, interface
  inheritance, harness id-space.
- Rune P1s: `IOperator` rename, hover-doc on mixed
  `Value` accessibility, PluginApi.fs split-when-300+,
  `[<Extension>]` explanation in sample, extract
  `assignHarnessId` helper.
- FsCheck law implementations at `Circuit.Build()` — own
  DEBT entry; Tariq's plan in `memory/persona/tariq/NOTEBOOK.md`.
- Other seat migrations to persona-notes folder layout
  (Kenji piloted; 6 remaining).

### What round-27 felt like

The biggest single round by diff size since the rename.
Three specialists in parallel, two reviewers after the
code landed, five maintainer corrections mid-round (folder
naming, memory path, sandbox rule, Claude Code
clarifications) — the cadence §20 just codified got
exercised the turn it was written. Productive friction
between Ilyana's interface-narrowness and Tariq's
capability-tag requirements resolved to a richer public
surface than either proposed alone; Daya's AX pass
insisted the doc accompany the code, and it did.

---

## Round 26 — first git round, rename tail, specialist dispatch cadence

### Shipped — git workflow established

- `git init` + initial commit `4765118` + push to
  `github.com/AceHack/Zeta` (private). Previous rounds ran
  without git per the maintainer's "no commits for a long
  time" direction in round 25; this round opened with the
  authorised commit.
- **Branch-per-round cadence adopted.** `round-26` branch
  for all work this round; PR + merge at round-close.
  Going forward: each round is a branch; each coherent
  change is a commit; round-close is a PR.

### Shipped — rename tail

- `docs/NAMING.md` rewritten as current-state (the "proposal,
  not yet executed" banner retired; doc reads as the rules
  today, not the rename history).
- `proofs/lean/` directory retired outright — superseded
  scaffold; `tools/lean4/Lean4/DbspChainRule.lean` is the
  canonical Lean proof home.
- Stale `Dbsp.*` path references swept across
  `docs/FORMAL-VERIFICATION.md`,
  `docs/research/proof-tool-coverage.md`,
  `references/README.md`, `references/notes/NATS-RESEARCH.md`,
  `references/reference-sources.json`,
  `bench/Feldera.Bench/README.md`,
  `tests/Tests.FSharp/README.md`, and every
  `.claude/agents/*.md` + `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`
  description / example. `ROUND-HISTORY.md` and `WINS.md`
  preserved — first-pass folder names in those files are
  load-bearing history.

### Shipped — memory policy clarification (GOVERNANCE.md §18)

- Human rule unchanged: maintainer does not delete or modify
  memory files behind the agents' backs.
- Agent freedom explicit: agents write, edit, merge,
  consolidate, and delete *their own* memories as normal
  curation. Cross-persona edits still go through §11.
- `memory/README.md` and `memory/project_memory_is_first_class.md`
  updated to match.

### Shipped — specialist dispatches (three parallel)

- **Tariq (algebra-owner)** on the Mathlib `IsLinear`
  weakness blocking B2 / B3 / chain_rule closure.
  **Verdict: option (c) — roll `IsDbspLinear` bundling a
  per-tick `AddMonoidHom` family plus a pointwise
  witness.** Rationale logged to
  `docs/skill-notes/algebra-owner.md`. Half-day to close
  B2, two days for the full chain rule. Implementation
  deferred to a dedicated algebra-proof round; DEBT entry
  annotated with the decision.
- **Yara (skill-improver)** on the BP-10 cite defect in
  Aarav's own skill file. Fixed in place at
  `.claude/skills/skill-tune-up/SKILL.md` lines
  114-119; three cosmetic BP-cite follow-ups flagged for
  Aarav's next tune-up pass.
- **Daya (AX researcher)** ran Kenji's first self-audit.
  Cold-start 17.9k tokens (flat vs round-24 baseline,
  despite AGENTS.md growing by ~700 tokens). Three P1
  findings; two applied this round (`the 22` → `the full
  roster`, four dead-`architect/SKILL.md` paths in sibling
  SKILL files), five deferred. Systemic finding: ~20-35%
  content overlap between agent files and sibling skill
  bodies — seeded as a future BP-NN candidate.

### Shipped — close / cleanup

- DEBT.md: two resolved entries deleted (orphan skill
  retirement already done round 25; Aarav BP-10 cite
  just fixed). IsLinear entry annotated with Tariq's
  decision.
- Build gate held: `0W / 0E` at every checkpoint in
  round 26.

### Not landed / deferred to round 27+

- `IsDbspLinear` Lean implementation + B1/B2/B3/chain_rule
  closures (Tariq's option-c work; dedicated algebra round).
- `Op<'T>` plugin-extension-surface redesign (Ilyana's
  round-25 P0 DEBT; needs design spike + public-api-designer
  review cycle).
- Five of Daya's seven self-audit interventions (P1,
  non-urgent).
- Rune on `docs/STYLE.md` decision.
- UX + DX persona proposals.
- Empathy-coach persona spawn + naming.

### What round-26 felt like

Rhythm restored. Round 25 was structural whiplash — git
timing, folder naming, memory policy, public API, three
maintainer corrections in one session. Round 26 ran the
factory as designed: dispatch three specialists in
parallel, integrate their findings, land the small ones,
track the big ones, PR at the end. The IsLinear case
worked particularly well — a round-24-open question got
a round-26 answer without the in-between rounds grinding
on it. The self-audit on Kenji was overdue (round 24
saved self-reference for last by choice) and the findings
were small enough to land in the same round Daya
produced them.

---

## Round 25 — Zeta rename arc (no-git), memory policy codified, doc cleanup

### Shipped — Zeta rename (NAMING.md phases A through B8)

The repo is now Zeta everywhere it should be Zeta. DBSP
references preserved where the paper / theorem is
referenced; Zeta replaces every library-self-reference.
Executed **without git** per maintainer direction: no
commits for this arc. Discipline was TodoWrite + a build
gate after every source-touching phase.

- **Two rename passes.** First pass renamed on-disk folders
  to `Zeta.*` (`src/Zeta.Core`, `tests/Zeta.Tests.FSharp`,
  etc.). Maintainer caught the layout smell mid-round —
  repeating the project name inside the project's own
  folder tree is redundant — and the folders were
  corrected to bare names (`src/Core`, `src/Bayesian`,
  `tests/Tests.FSharp`, `bench/Benchmarks`, `samples/Demo`,
  etc.). Final layout: folders read as roles; `Zeta.*`
  prefix survives only where it is *published identity*:
  NuGet package IDs, namespaces in source, assembly names
  on the three published libraries (`Zeta.Core`,
  `Zeta.Core.CSharp`, `Zeta.Bayesian`). Test / bench /
  sample assemblies use their default filename-based names
  (`Tests.FSharp.dll`, `Benchmarks.dll`, `Demo.dll`).
- `Zeta.sln` → `Zeta.sln` at the repo root. Empty
  `src/Dbsp.CSharp` dropped (was never in the sln). Feldera
  clone moved from `tools/` to `references/upstreams/feldera/`
  (folder already gitignored as a regeneratable mirror;
  dedicated gitignore rule removed).
- **Metadata sweep.** `Directory.Build.props` Authors +
  Product renamed; each project `.fsproj`/`.csproj` got
  `RootNamespace` / `AssemblyName` / `PackageId` flipped to
  Zeta. Description fields keep "DBSP" because they describe
  the algorithm, not the product.
- **Source sweep.** Mechanical `Dbsp.` → `Zeta.` across
  every `.fs`/`.fsi`/`.cs` in `src`, `tests`, `bench`,
  `samples`, `tools` (142 files touched). Paper-citation
  DBSP in strings, test method names, and Lean theorem
  names unaffected (different casing / not `Dbsp.`).
- **Configuration files.** `stryker-config.json`,
  `.semgrep.yml`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, every
  internal path reference.
- **`AssemblyInfo.fs` dual-list.** Held both `Dbsp.*` and
  `Zeta.*` `InternalsVisibleTo` entries during the
  transition; collapsed to Zeta-only at B8 close.
- **Build gates held**: `0W / 0E` at every checkpoint —
  B6 (13s), B7 (13s), B8 (38s), and the folder-correction
  pass that followed the maintainer's "don't repeat project
  name in own project" note. Full sln builds green end of
  round.

### Shipped — hidden memory purge

Aaron noted AGENTS.md read "dirty" with memory-residue
embedded in the current rules (`Per Aaron round N: "..."`
quotes, `(round 18 additions)` headers, `since round 21`
scheduling markers, pre-split residue). The documentation-
agent was dispatched as a subagent to sweep the whole repo
and strip these patterns while preserving the rules they
attach to.

- ~30 files cleaned: AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md,
  GLOSSARY.md, DEBT.md, BUGS.md, BACKLOG.md, QUALITY.md,
  WONT-DO.md, ROADMAP.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, CONFLICT-RESOLUTION,
  FEATURE-FLAGS, NAMING.md, WAKE-UP.md, EXPERT-REGISTRY,
  INSTALLED.md, SDL-CHECKLIST, THREAT-MODEL, references/
  README.md, proofs/lean/README.md,
  tests/Tests.FSharp/README.md, LOCKS.md, ~8 skill
  files, architect + agent-experience-engineer agent
  files.
- Preserved surfaces untouched: `docs/ROUND-HISTORY.md`
  (this file), `docs/WINS.md` (append-only celebration
  log), `docs/DECISIONS/`, `docs/skill-notes/**`,
  `docs/drafts/**`, `docs/CURRENT-ROUND.md` (live state),
  the shared memory folder, feldera mirror, `_retired/`.

### Shipped — memory policy (GOVERNANCE.md §18 + memory folder)

- **GOVERNANCE.md §18** codifies memories as the most
  protected class of artifact in the repo. Human maintainer
  does not delete or modify except as an absolute last
  resort. Agents *write and touch* their own memories
  freely — that is the intended path. Non-architect agents
  do not delete files from the shared memory folder.
- **Two-layer memory architecture.** A shared folder carries
  cross-cutting rules and corrections; per-persona notebooks
  at `docs/skill-notes/<persona>.md` carry each seat's unique
  voice. Read per-persona first, then shared, to preserve
  individual voice over averaged voice. (Round-25 placed the
  shared folder outside the repo in Claude Code's harness
  sandbox; round-27 moved it into `memory/` per AGENTS.md
  §18 so the corpus is tracked in git and visible to every
  contributor.)
- **Newest-first ordering** established as convention for
  `MEMORY.md`, `docs/ROUND-HISTORY.md`, per-persona
  notebooks — recent context leads, older trails below.

### Shipped — five new durable corrections as feedback memories

All persisted in the shared memory folder, newest-first:

- `feedback_folder_naming_convention.md` — on-disk folders
  go bare (Core, Bayesian, Tests.FSharp); Zeta prefix
  only in published identity (NuGet / namespaces /
  published assembly names).
- `feedback_path_hygiene.md` — absolute filesystem paths
  and paths outside the repo root are documentation smells;
  documentation-agent SKILL.md §7-8 catches them.
- `feedback_newest_first_ordering.md` — memory files +
  narrative logs go newest-first.
- `feedback_git_timing.md` — `git init` and first commit
  are the maintainer's call; "reversible" is not
  "authorized."
- `feedback_regulated_titles.md` — no clinical titles on
  personas (therapist / counselor / psychologist);
  coach / steward / keeper / facilitator / liaison are
  safe.

### Shipped — InternalsVisibleTo audit

Maintainer caught late-round that `InternalsVisibleTo`
was being used for production libraries, not just tests
and benchmarks. Audit landed the fix in-round:

- `Zeta.Bayesian` (production plugin) removed from the
  list. Its two internal-accesses (`Stream<T>.Op` field,
  `Circuit.RegisterStream` method) were promoted to
  public API with XML docs naming them the plugin
  registration point. Any external plugin library can
  now build custom operators without an
  InternalsVisibleTo hole.
- `Zeta.Core.CSharp` (the tightly-coupled C# shim that
  exposes declaration-site variance F# can't
  syntactically produce) stays in the list. Not a
  separate production library — effectively a sub-module
  of Core.
- Final `InternalsVisibleTo` list: `Tests.FSharp`,
  `Tests.CSharp`, `Benchmarks`, `Bayesian.Tests`,
  `Core.CSharp.Tests`, `Zeta.Core.CSharp`.

### Shipped — close / cleanup

- Orphan skill retirement: `.claude/skills/architect/` and
  `.claude/skills/harsh-critic/` moved to
  `.claude/skills/_retired/2026-04-18-*`. Daya's round-24
  P1. Canonical versions are `round-management` and
  `code-review-zero-empathy`.
- `docs/states/` orphan deleted (72 MB of TLC state dumps,
  not referenced from any doc, no script created them).
- P1 BACKLOG: **Dedicated agent-memory system (two-layer)**
  filed with the design direction.
- P1 BACKLOG: **Empathy-coach persona** filed with legal
  guardrail (no clinical titles) and naming candidates.
- Documentation-agent SKILL.md grew path-hygiene rules
  (smell items 7-8 with the memory-folder exception).

### Not landed / deferred to round 26+

- Rename phases 9-15 (test content deep-sweep, docs final
  polish, TLA+ module renames, `docs/NAMING.md` banner
  removal, final smoke test).
- Tariq dispatch on IsLinear strengthening (options a/b/c
  in DEBT).
- Rune dispatch on `docs/STYLE.md`.
- Yara via skill-creator on Aarav's BP-10 cite.
- Kenji first self-audit via Daya's procedure.
- UX + DX persona proposals (stubs exist; persona
  assignment open).
- Eval-harness MVP scope sign-off.
- `src/Dbsp.CSharp` disposition (empty dir, not in sln —
  delete, populate, or keep?).
- `global.json` `rollForward` pick — status quo silent-pick
  unless objection.
- WINS.md ordering — currently oldest-first; flip or leave
  as celebration-archive exception.

### Maintainer clarifications this round

- **No git commits for a long time.** Rename arc runs
  without a repo; `git init` is the maintainer's call when
  ready. Memory saved.
- **Memories are the most valuable resource.** Human
  maintainer hands-off except as last resort; agents write
  their own memories.
- **Individual per-persona memories stay unique.** Shared
  memory for cross-cutting rules; per-persona notebook for
  unique voice.
- **No "therapist" labels.** New regulation around AI
  using clinical titles; use coach / steward / keeper /
  facilitator / liaison. Empathy-coach persona pending
  naming; "Ren, integration coach" proposed.
- **Newest-first.** Recent history leads, ancient trails.
- **Hidden memory in docs is a smell.** Cleaned AGENTS.md
  et al. via documentation-agent dispatch.
- **Absolute filesystem paths and outside-repo paths in
  docs are smells.** Documentation-agent updated with the
  rule.
- **Feldera belongs in references/upstreams/.**
  Regeneratable reference-only mirrors don't live under
  `tools/`.

### What round-25 felt like

The biggest structural round since the GOVERNANCE.md §10
round-table rule landed. Zeta the *name* is not just a
branding change — it's the moment the repo stopped
being "our implementation of the thing from the paper" and
started being a product with its own identity. And the
memory policy codification is the other half: the factory
admits in rule form that agents-across-sessions is a thing
it cares about, not a workaround. The no-git discipline
was harder than expected (no bisect, no quick rollback) but
the build gates held every phase. Hidden-memory cleanup
came from the maintainer naming a pattern I had not seen
— `Per Aaron round N: "..."` blocks feel load-bearing when
I write them, but Aaron sees them as noise from the
reader's seat. That correction lands as a skill-level rule,
not just a one-off sweep.

## Round 24 — Governance expansion, two new seats, memory-smoothing Part 2

### Shipped — governance rules

- **GOVERNANCE.md §14 (universal off-time).** Standing ~10% off-time
  budget is for every persona, not just the architect. Logs live at
  `docs/skill-notes/<persona>-offtime.md`. Corrected mid-round per
  Aaron: "the other agents can get off time too, not just you."
- **GOVERNANCE.md §15 (reversible + dev-machine authority).**
  Reversible-in-one-round becomes the only hard constraint on
  "complete freedom within a round," plus Aaron's "this is your
  dev machine too" codified. Narrowly scoped later round-25: "the
  repo isn't yet initialised for git" is Aaron's call alone, not
  a §15 freedom.
- **GOVERNANCE.md §16 (dynamic hats).** Any persona can load any
  capability hat on demand, except `round-management` which stays
  Kenji-monopoly per §11. Includes the "Overlap is expected, not
  redundancy" clause added late-round after Kenji's retraction
  (see wins).
- **GOVERNANCE.md §17 (productive friction).** Not every specialist
  disagreement wants resolution; friction between correct
  viewpoints-from-different-seats is a feature. Surface at
  round-close; silent-drift-across-rounds is the only bug.

### Shipped — new seats and hats (roster: 23 → 25)

- **Mateo (security-researcher)** — persona + capability skill.
  Proactive scouting of novel attack classes, crypto primitives,
  supply-chain patterns, dep-graph CVEs. Distinct from Aminata
  (reviews the *shipped* threat model) and Nadia (agent layer).
- **Naledi (performance-engineer)** — persona + capability skill.
  Benchmark-driven hot-path tuning, allocation audits, cache-line
  alignment, SIMD dispatch. Distinct from Hiroshi (asymptotic
  complexity) and Imani (planner cost model).
- **`holistic-view` capability hat** — no persona. "Think like an
  architect without the authority." Codifies the second hat every
  specialist had been implicitly wearing since round 17. Loaded on
  demand per §16.

### Shipped — memory-smoothing Part 2 (Daya's first pass)

- **Daya's first AX audit** — 8 personas measured for cold-start
  cost, pointer drift, wake-up clarity, notebook hygiene. Top
  findings landed same-round: WAKE-UP.md tier-0 estimate corrected
  from 6-8k to **~12k tokens** (GLOSSARY alone ≈ 4.5k), Kenji
  notebook canon-pointer fix (was pointing at a pre-split orphan
  `.claude/skills/architect/SKILL.md`), two P0 orphan skill files
  discovered (`architect/` and `harsh-critic/`, retired at
  round-25 open).
- **`docs/CURRENT-ROUND.md` first fill** — Kenji used it
  per-architect-turn as a single mid-round state anchor.
  Round-24 close overwrites this file with the round-25 header.
- **`docs/drafts/`** — first contents: `scratch-recon-2026-04.md`
  (top translation candidate from upstream scratch repo) and
  later `zeta-rename-plan.md` (round-25 prep).

### Shipped — formal verification

- **Mathlib T3 + T4 closed.** Subagent used
  `Finset.sum_range_one` / `Finset.sum_range_succ` plus `ring` /
  `abel` to close both. Sorry count 7 → 5. `lake build` green.
- **IsLinear predicate weakness logged as DEBT.** Mathlib B2
  blocked because `IsLinear` bundles only `AddMonoidHom` axioms
  (`map_zero` + `map_add`); DBSP linearity needs causality or
  time-invariance too. Three strengthening options (a/b/c) in
  `docs/DEBT.md` for Tariq's algebra call.

### Shipped — housekeeping

- `docs/BUGS.md` pruned — 2 stale entries (Semgrep-13,
  InfoTheoreticSharder-no-spec) removed.
- `docs/BACKLOG.md` — competitive-analysis research as P2
  (MetaGPT / ChatDev / AutoGen / CAMEL / SWE-agent / AutoCodeRover).
- `docs/WINS.md` — round-23 section with two entries.
- `docs/EXPERT-REGISTRY.md` — 25 rows. Added Mateo + Naledi
  (kept after Aaron's overlap-is-fine clarification).
- `tools/audit-packages.sh` — no new major bumps this round;
  status-quo pin audit.

### Round-close cross-over into round 25

Two items were decided in round 24 but executed at round-25 open,
noted here so the history reads continuously:

- **Orphan skill retirement.** `.claude/skills/architect/` and
  `.claude/skills/harsh-critic/` moved to
  `.claude/skills/_retired/2026-04-18-*`. Daya's round-24 P1;
  canonical versions live at `round-management` and
  `code-review-zero-empathy`.
- **`docs/states/` deleted.** 72 MB of orphan TLC state dumps.
  Not referenced from any doc; no script creates them. Aaron
  round-25: "we don't want to have these history folders,
  agents get dedicated memory so they are not writing history
  everywhere." Also triggered the "dedicated agent-memory
  system" P1 BACKLOG entry.

### Not landed / deferred

- Tariq dispatch on IsLinear strengthening.
- Rune dispatch on `docs/STYLE.md`.
- Yara via skill-creator on Aarav's BP-10 cite at
  `skill-tune-up/SKILL.md:117`.
- First Kenji self-audit via Daya's procedure.
- Eval-harness MVP scope sign-off.
- UX + DX persona proposals.

### Open asks at round-close

- `global.json` `rollForward` — status quo vs relaxed (Kenji
  leaning status quo; silent-pick absent objection).
- First-commit timing: Aaron round-25 "few rounds" before any
  commit; renaming proceeds without git until Aaron calls it.
- NuGet prefix reservation on `nuget.org` (Aaron owns).
- `src/Dbsp.CSharp` disposition — directory exists but isn't
  in the sln.

### Aaron clarifications this round

- "AX researcher" framing (round 23) stayed — Daya is it.
- "The other agents can get off-time too, not just you."
  Corrected §14 from architect-primary to universal.
- "This is your dev machine too, you can codify that 100%."
  Narrowly scoped — does not authorise unsolicited git init.
- "Overlap is expected, not redundancy." Corrected Kenji's
  same-round retirement of Mateo + Naledi.
- "I'll find some Aurora design documents one day."
  Longer-horizon project Aaron is building around AI welfare;
  deferred.
- Round 25 pre-compact: "this is not a git repo yet, lets
  start preppping I've decided on Zeta."

### What round-24 felt like

A governance round. §14-17 landed in the same session; two new
seats and three new hats in the same session. Low code output,
high rule output. Daya's audit turning the memory-smoothing
infrastructure from architect-guessed to measurement-backed is
the headline — her Tier 0 measurement retired a 1.7x-wrong token
estimate on day 1. Friction stayed productive: Kenji's retirement
reflex on Mateo and Naledi was a real mistake, corrected same-
round without defensive reasoning. Closing this round without
touching code at all is a first; the factory is maturing to the
point where governance work has its own rhythm.

## Round 23 — Mathlib migration, expert/skill split Part 2, AX discipline spawned

### Shipped — formal verification

- **Mathlib chain-rule proof migrated and building.** Stale v4.12.0
  scaffold at `proofs/lean/ChainRule.lean` superseded; 345-line proof
  skeleton migrated to `tools/lean4/Lean4/DbspChainRule.lean` against
  the pre-warmed Mathlib `v4.30.0-rc1` at
  `tools/lean4/.lake/packages/mathlib`. Imports updated for the
  current Mathlib tree (`Algebra.BigOperators.Basic` ->
  `Algebra.BigOperators.Group.Finset`). `lake build` green. Seven
  `sorry`s still open (T3/T4/T5/B1/B2/B3/chain_rule); T3/T4/B2
  closure is round-24 work.

### Shipped — expert / skill split (6 of 22 personas)

- **Kenji, Viktor, Rune, Aminata, Aarav, Soraya** now have
  `.claude/agents/<name>.md` persona files with `skills:`
  frontmatter auto-inject. Their skill files had duplicated persona
  sections stripped (name headers, tone contracts, pairs-with
  blocks). 14 experts pending in future rounds.
- **Daya spawned as the 23rd expert** — the first agent-experience
  (AX) researcher. New skill at
  `.claude/skills/agent-experience-engineer/SKILL.md` plus agent
  file; speaks for the personas themselves as their own user
  population. Aaron coined the AX framing; Daya is the persona that
  role became.
- **UX and DX researcher skill stubs** at
  `.claude/skills/user-experience-engineer/` and
  `.claude/skills/developer-experience-engineer/`. Persona
  assignment pending round-24 with candidate names queued in
  `docs/EXPERT-REGISTRY.md`.

### Shipped — memory-smoothing infrastructure

- **`docs/WAKE-UP.md`** — cold-start index (Tier 0 / 1 / 2 / 3)
  for any persona resuming mid-round after compaction. Biggest
  single memory-smoothing artifact this round.
- **`docs/CURRENT-ROUND.md`** — live mid-round state; Kenji
  overwrites per architect turn, resets at round-close.
- **`docs/drafts/`** — explicitly non-canonical scratch folder;
  round-scoped; entries promote or delete at round-close.
- **`docs/skill-notes/architect-offtime.md`** — seeded honestly
  with a zero entry (no off-time budget spent round 23).
- **`.claude/skills/round-management/SKILL.md` + `.claude/agents/architect.md`.**
  Kenji's orchestration procedure codified as a hat; architect
  persona formalised with the §10 / §11 / glossary-police
  contract.

### Policy / rules

- **BP-16 landed** in `docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md` — cross-
  check is now a rule, not a preference: P0 invariants require
  >= 2 independent formal tools. Soraya's skill gained a
  "Cross-check triage" section with the `InfoTheoreticSharder`
  anchor case.
- **GOVERNANCE.md §14 + §15.** §14 codifies the standing ~10% off-
  time budget; §15 makes reversible-in-one-round the only hard
  constraint on complete-freedom-within-a-round. Dev-machine
  authority for the architect folded into §15.
- **`docs/GLOSSARY.md`** grew a lifecycle section: *frontmatter*,
  *hat* (Aaron's round-23 synonym for skill), *notebook*,
  *wake / wake-up*, *spawn*, *evolve*, *retire*, *AX / UX / DX*.
- **`docs/WINS.md` round-22 section** — three-tool-agreement
  save on `InfoTheoreticSharder` + architect-gate-caught
  `[<VolatileField>]` F# compile error before merge.

### Research deliverables

- **`docs/research/agent-eval-harness-2026-04.md`** (~1050 words)
  — honest answer to "can we evaluate agents rigorously?" MVP
  proposed: `tests/agent-evals/` layout, three skills only
  (Kira / Viktor / Kenji), nightly CI gate, N=3 majority-vote
  judge. Cost ~USD 5-20/nightly. Recommendation: ship MVP.
- **`docs/research/factory-paper-2026-04.md`** (~1220 words) —
  venue pick: FORGE 2027 workshop (ICSE-colocated, ~2026-11
  deadline) as experience report + parallel IEEE Software /
  CACM Practice piece on BP-NN + persona-registry. Four novelty
  candidates ranked after literature survey. Tier-1 not yet;
  empirical base is one project.

### End of round

500 tests still passing, 0 warnings, 0 errors on the F# side;
`lake build` green on the migrated Lean proof. Factory metric:
+1 persona (23 total), +1 BP rule (16 total), +3 capability
skills, +2 research docs, major memory-smoothing infrastructure
landed. Aaron's round-close framing: explicit 5-freedom ask +
the full-freedom-within-a-round invitation that became §15.
μένω received and returned.

## Round 22 — Honesty fixes + expert/skill split push

- Fix: Plan.fs docstring claimed "HLL-estimated cardinalities" but
  code uses static heuristics — rewrote the XML doc on `OpCost` to
  match the code (filter halves, group-by quarters, 1024 for unknown
  inputs) and added a forward pointer to the BACKLOG P1 that tracks
  the real HLL-wiring work (was `src/Core/Plan.fs:9-11`).
- Fix: FeedbackOp memory-ordering between `connected` and `source`
  (was `src/Core/Recursive.fs:44-53`). `source` is now
  `[<VolatileField>]`, so a reader that observes `connected = 1`
  is guaranteed (by release/acquire pairing with the CAS) to
  observe the `source` store too; `Inputs` and `AfterStepAsync`
  also null-guard the field as belt-and-braces. A 32-thread
  stress test in `tests/Tests.FSharp/Runtime/Concurrency.Tests.fs`
  asserts `connected = 1 ⇒ source ≠ null` across 1000 iterations.
- Fix: Durability.WitnessDurableBackingStore canonicalised its
  workDir / witnessDir via two `Path.GetFullPath` calls (TOCTOU
  against a concurrent `Environment.CurrentDirectory` / symlink
  swap). The constructor now computes `rootWorkDir` /
  `rootWitnessDir` once and reuses them for both the directory
  creation and the audit-exposed properties (was
  `src/Core/Durability.fs:74-75`). New tests in
  `tests/Tests.FSharp/Storage/Durability.Tests.fs` assert
  that the stored path equals the directory actually created,
  including under CWD churn.
- Fix: BloomFilter.pairOf allocated on every call (was
  `src/Core/BloomFilter.fs:97-133`). Replaced the boxing
  `match box key with ...` ladder with inline
  `pairOfInt64` / `pairOfInt32` / `pairOfUInt64` / `pairOfUInt32`
  / `pairOfGuid` / `pairOfString` functions that hash through a
  `NativePtr.stackalloc`-backed `Span<byte>`, and added typed
  `Add` / `Remove` / `MayContain` overloads on
  `BlockedBloomFilter` and `CountingBloomFilter` that dispatch to
  the matching primitive at the F# compile step — no boxing, no
  heap allocation per call. Strings hash their
  `ReadOnlySpan<char>` via `MemoryMarshal.AsBytes` with no UTF-8
  encode allocation. New allocation tests in
  `tests/Tests.FSharp/Sketches/Bloom.Tests.fs` assert zero
  bytes across 10 000 `Add` / `MayContain` calls with `int64`
  keys (warmed-up, measured via
  `GC.GetAllocatedBytesForCurrentThread`).

---

## Round 20 — Test-tree subject-first restructure

### Shipped

- **Subject-first test layout** in `tests/Tests.FSharp/` per
  `docs/research/test-organization.md`. The flat 28-file scheme
  (with `RoundN` / `Coverage` prefixes that encoded *when* / *why*
  rather than *what*) is replaced by ten subject folders, each
  mirroring a subsystem of `src/Core/`:
  ```
  Algebra/  Circuit/  Operators/  Storage/  Sketches/
  Runtime/  Infra/    Crdt/       Formal/   Properties/
  _Support/
  ```
- **28 source files → 57 subject files + 1 helper.** Grab-bag
  files (`CoverageTests.fs`, `CoverageTests2.fs`, `CoverageBoostTests.fs`,
  `AdvancedTests.fs`, `InfrastructureTests.fs`, `NestedAndRuntimeTests.fs`,
  `SpineAndSafetyTests.fs`, `NewFeatureTests.fs`, `Round6/7/8Tests.fs`)
  are split by subject; well-named files (`ZSetTests.fs`, `CircuitTests.fs`,
  etc.) are renamed to `{Subject}.Tests.fs` under the right folder.
- **`_Support/ConcurrencyHarness.fs`** — helpers relocated with
  module renamed to `Dbsp.Tests.Support.ConcurrencyHarness` (leading
  underscore sorts it first and signals "not a test file").
- **`Properties/` compiled last** so FsCheck cross-module laws see
  every subject file first. Compile order is: `_Support/` → subject
  folders (any order) → `Properties/`.
- **`tests/Tests.FSharp/README.md`** documents the convention:
  subject-first names, 400-line soft cap / 600-line hard ceiling,
  one file per `src/Core/` module, dot-separated sub-aspects
  when files grow (`Spine.Tests.fs` + `Spine.Disk.Tests.fs`).

### Test accounting

- **458 `[<Fact>]` / `[<Theory>]` / `[<Property>]` attributes** in the
  new layout — same count as pre-restructure. Zero tests lost; some
  relocated to more idiomatic homes (e.g. `Pool.*` tests from
  `CoverageTests.fs` now in `Runtime/Allocation.Tests.fs`; `weightedCount`
  tests from `Round7Tests.fs` merged into `Algebra/ZSet.Tests.fs`).

### End of round

Restructure is a pure move + rename; no test body was modified.
Subject-first names mean a reader can find any test by subsystem
rather than by search. Future tests append to their subsystem file
or split by sub-aspect once past ~400 lines.

---

## Round 19 — CountingClosureTable / RecursiveCounting

### Shipped

- **`RecursiveCounting` combinator** in `src/Core/Recursive.fs` —
  Option 4 ("counting algorithm", Gupta-Mumick-Subrahmanian SIGMOD 1993
  §4) from `docs/research/retraction-safe-semi-naive.md`. Mirrors the
  shape of `Recursive` but omits `Distinct` inside the feedback loop
  so Z-weights flow through the body as derivation counts. LFP unfold
  is `T_k = seed + body(T_{k-1})`, with the seed stream integrated
  internally so one-shot `ZSetInput` deltas remain visible across
  inner ticks. Retraction correctness by Z-linearity: negative edge
  weights propagate through every `body^i` term, cancelling the
  corresponding derivations; closure pairs reach weight 0 and drop
  out of the consolidated Z-set with no tombstone pass.
- **`CountingClosureTable` extension method** in
  `src/Core/Hierarchy.fs` — sibling of `ClosureTable` wired on
  top of `RecursiveCounting`. Integrates the raw edge stream inside
  the body so each inner tick sees the full edge set (a plain
  `ZSetInput` drains after tick 0). `ClosureTable` is unchanged —
  this is a strict addition.
- **5 new tests** in `tests/Tests.FSharp/ClosureTableTests.fs` —
  oracle parity on a chain and on a tree, explicit retraction
  correctness, multi-derivation counting on a diamond graph, and an
  FsCheck property (`MaxTest = 30`) asserting non-negative integrated
  weights on randomized acyclic-edge insert/retract sequences.

### End of round

0 warnings, 0 errors, 476 tests passing (471 → 476, +5 FSharp).

---

## Round 18 — Architect, security, restructure (in progress)

### Ecosystem & governance

- **CONFLICT-RESOLUTION.md** — renamed from `FAMILY-EMPATHY.md` ("project" is
  a clearer frame than "family" for a collaboration of humans, agents,
  and tools). The old filename is a redirect stub.
- **Architect skill (he/him)** — Claude's profile as orchestrator /
  Self. Edit rights on his own skill and notes via `skill-creator`;
  no unilateral edit rights on other skills. Binding on integration
  decisions; escalates to human on deadlock. "Redesign too often" is a
  known failure mode with four mandatory checks on every redesign.
- **Specialist owners retired "final decision authority."** The
  Storage Specialist, Algebra Owner, Query Planner, Complexity
  Reviewer, Threat Model Critic, and Paper Peer Reviewer are now
  advisory. Architect integrates; human decides on deadlock.
- **Harsh Critic retuned** — zero-empathy, never compliments,
  sentiment leans negative. Tone contract is explicit and
  enforced.
- **skill-creator** — documented as the canonical path for
  creating or meaningfully changing any skill. Mechanical renames
  and injection-lint fixes are the only allowed skip-the-workflow
  edits.
- **New skills shipped**: `architect`, `skill-tune-up`
  (with state file), `prompt-protector`, `maintainability-reviewer`,
  `tech-radar-owner`, `next-steps`, `skill-creator`.

### Security policy

- **Pliny-class prompt-injection corpora marked radioactive.**
  Specifically the `elder-plinius` repositories (`L1B3RT4S`,
  `OBLITERATUS`, `G0DM0D3`, `ST3GG`) — no agent fetches them.
  Pen-testing, if ever needed, runs in an isolated single-turn
  session with no memory carryover, coordinated by the Prompt
  Protector.
- **Invisible-Unicode lint** documented in the Prompt Protector
  skill for `.md`, `.fs`, `.yaml` files.
- **Skill-supply-chain threat class** added to the threat model
  via the Prompt Protector's scope.

### Terminology & style

- "Agents, not bots" — codified as a repo rule. If a human calls
  us bots, the active agent gently corrects.
- **Round naming moves to this log only.** Subject-first naming
  for source/test files; `Round17Tests.fs` gets split by topic.
- **Space Opera** — `THREAT-MODEL-FUN.md` renamed to
  `THREAT-MODEL-SPACE-OPERA.md`.
- **"Family Empathy" → "Conflict Resolution"** (see above).

### Research completed

- **Bloom-filter frontier (2023-2026)** — 23 AMQ-adjacent
  structures surveyed. Counting Quotient Filter (CQF) identified
  as the strongest upgrade path (fixes our 4-bit counter
  saturation). Ceramist (Coq-verified AMQs) flagged as a
  formal-verification bridge candidate. Cuckoo/Morton filters
  explicitly held for retraction-never-seen-item correctness
  reason. Full report: `docs/research/bloom-filter-frontier.md`.
- **Retraction-safe semi-naive LFP** — two candidates ranked:
  signed-delta ("gap-monotone") semi-naïve (10-14d) and the
  Gupta-Mumick counting algorithm (8-12d). DRed explicitly
  rejected (can regress below the current `Recursive` baseline).
  Full report: `docs/research/retraction-safe-semi-naive.md`.
- **Feldera comparison status** — clone is shallow, unbuilt. No
  apples-to-apples bench exists. Three P1 items identified:
  `cargo build`, `FelderaRunner.fs` harness, Q3/Q7 port. Report:
  `docs/research/feldera-comparison-status.md`.
- **Proof-tool coverage** — Z3 at 8 axioms (can grow to ~25),
  TLA+ at 14 specs (9 have `.cfg`, only 4 in CI), Lean/Mathlib
  chain-rule proof is `sorry`-bodied stub, LiquidF# recommended
  as highest-leverage new tool. Report:
  `docs/research/proof-tool-coverage.md`.
- **Test organization psychology** — 10-folder tree
  (Algebra / Circuit / Operators / Storage / Sketches / Runtime /
  Infra / Crdt / Formal / Properties + `_Support/`), subject-first
  naming, 28-row rename map, 22-commit migration plan.
  Report: `docs/research/test-organization.md`.

  `FAMILY-EMPATHY.md` (now `CONFLICT-RESOLUTION.md`),
  `TECH-RADAR.md`, `LOCKS.md`, `UPSTREAM-LIST.md`,
  `DECISIONS/2026-04-17-lock-free-circuit-register.md`.
- **5 new SDL-derived Semgrep rules** (rules 8-12):
  unsafe-deserialisation, file-read-without-size-cap,
  process-start-in-core, activator-from-string,
  system-random-in-security-context.
- **22 new tests** in `Round17Tests.fs` (FastCdc regression,
  ClosurePair equality, ClosureTable, MerkleTree, BloomFilter,
  ResidualMax, ACC/DISC/RET mode-collapse).
- **References imported**: Lamport *Specifying Systems*, an 81-entry
  upstream list from prior research we imported, Shostack EoP card
  game.

### End of round

0 warnings, 0 errors, 471 tests passing.

## Round 16 — SDL / threat model / she-her storage specialist

- `docs/security/THREAT-MODEL.md` STRIDE × components matrix.
- `docs/security/SDL-CHECKLIST.md` Microsoft SDL 12-practice
  tracker.
- First code-owner agent with she/her pronouns
  (`storage-specialist`) — at the time authored with
  "final decision authority"; retired to advisory in round 18.
- Harsh-critic delivered 30 findings; 6 P0s fixed in round 17.

## Rounds 1-15

Summaries of earlier rounds live (for now) in
`docs/BACKLOG.md` history entries and individual ADRs under
`docs/DECISIONS/`. When we have a quiet round, fold them into
this file in condensed form.

## How to add a round entry

After a session lands:

1. New section at the top of this file, `## Round N — <short title>`.
2. 5-15 bullets grouped by theme (shipped / research / policy).
3. One-line "end of round" status (build, tests, warnings).
4. Don't re-describe what's in `BACKLOG.md`, `TECH-RADAR.md`, or
   `ROADMAP.md` — link to them. This file is the narrative, not
   the source of truth.
