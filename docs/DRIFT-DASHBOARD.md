# Zeta drift dashboard

> **NOT OK — RED 8 · UNKNOWN 5, incl. NEVER observed · coverage 61/66 (SHORTFALL 5) · green 55 · not-yet-due 1 · on-demand 14**

A check that was never observed must never render identically to a check that passed.
`Unknown` is a first-class verdict here and can never aggregate into green: an unobserved
check is an unbounded number of unknown failures, so it is ranked ABOVE green and BY AGE.

## RED — 8

Oldest first: a check red since the 16th outranks one red five minutes ago.

| check | red for | expectation | detail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `budget-snapshot-cadence` | 6d | periodic | run 31959534906 concluded 'failure' |
| `tlaps-proof` | 18h | on-change | run 32542476787 concluded 'failure' |
| `manifesto-citation-snapshot-cadence` | 12h | periodic | run 32558211949 concluded 'failure' |
| `context-cost-trend-cadence` | 12h | periodic | run 32559948214 concluded 'failure' |
| `installer-unit-tests` | 54m | on-change | run 32590647061 concluded 'failure' |
| `k8s-lane-partition` | 48m | on-change | run 32591039648 concluded 'failure' |
| `gate` | 19m | on-change | run 32591565565 concluded 'failure' · **recheck in flight — this is the last CONCLUDED verdict, not a current one** |
| `build-ai-cluster-iso` | 15m | on-change | run 32591565609 concluded 'failure' |

## UNKNOWN — 5

**Longest silence first.** Silence that persists is the strongest signal and the easiest
to habituate to, so it is aged rather than listed. `never-observed` sorts above every
finite silence, because that is what infinite silence is.

The `why unknown` column is load-bearing — five reasons, and they are NOT interchangeable:
`never-observed` (no data has ever existed) · `not-observed-this-pass` (data may exist; this
pass could not see it — today's bug wears this one's clothes) · `registered-but-absent` (the
producer declares the check and its definition is missing from the repository) ·
`expectation-unknown` (cannot tell whether it should run at all) · `source-error` (we failed
to ask, which is not the same as a correct silence).

| check | silent for | why unknown | expectation | detail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `copilot` | **NEVER observed** | expectation-unknown | unknown | cannot tell whether this check should run on this ref (host-managed check 'dynamic/copilot-swe-agent/copilot' — never declared in this repository, so its trigger cannot be read from the tree), and it has never produced a verdict |
| `image-pull-measurement` | **NEVER observed** | registered-but-absent | unknown | REGISTERED with the producer but its definition is ABSENT from the repository (workflow file '.github/workflows/image-pull-measurement.yml' is registered ACTIVE on the forge host but is ABSENT from the repository) — roster-versus-repository drift, invisible to a run-list check and to a file-tree check alike |
| `inventory-phase5-proof` | **NEVER observed** | registered-but-absent | unknown | REGISTERED with the producer but its definition is ABSENT from the repository (workflow file '.github/workflows/inventory-phase5-proof.yml' is registered ACTIVE on the forge host but is ABSENT from the repository) — roster-versus-repository drift, invisible to a run-list check and to a file-tree check alike |
| `substrate-claim-checker` | **NEVER observed** | registered-but-absent | unknown | REGISTERED with the producer but its definition is ABSENT from the repository (workflow file '.github/workflows/substrate-claim-checker.yml' is registered ACTIVE on the forge host but is ABSENT from the repository) — roster-versus-repository drift, invisible to a run-list check and to a file-tree check alike |
| `zz-rustup-cache-probe` | **NEVER observed** | registered-but-absent | unknown | REGISTERED with the producer but its definition is ABSENT from the repository (workflow file '.github/workflows/zz-rustup-cache-probe.yml' is registered ACTIVE on the forge host but is ABSENT from the repository) — roster-versus-repository drift, invisible to a run-list check and to a file-tree check alike |

## Not yet due — 1

Declared, correct, and **not yet owed a verdict** — its definition has not existed for a
full period. Its own state on purpose: calling it green claims a verdict nobody gave, and
calling it red cries wolf on every scheduled check anyone adds, which gets the alarm muted.

| check | expectation | detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chart-version-refresh` | periodic | declared to run every 7d (schedule: '7 17 \* \* 0') and its definition landed only 23h ago, less than one full period — no verdict is owed yet |

## Running (0) / skipped (2)

| check | state | detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mirror-to-fork` | skipped | run 32590487948 was skipped |
| `rerun-cancelled-gate` | skipped | run 32593542864 was skipped |

## Not applicable — 10

Declared to fire only on request, so silence on this ref is **correct**. Listed, not
hidden, and deliberately not called green — a distinction laundered is a distinction lost.

Generated by `bun src/Core.TypeScript/drift-dashboard/cli.ts`. The roster lives at
`db/drift-dashboard/roster.json` — a new check appearing and a known check vanishing are
both events you can see in a `git diff`. A vanished check keeps its slot and keeps being
counted; retirement is written by hand, with a reason, and by nothing else.
