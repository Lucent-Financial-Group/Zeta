# Failure-Taxonomy Undecidability — Proof Sketch via Rice's Theorem

**Status:** proof sketch (not machine-checked)
**Date:** 2026-05-09
**Origin:** Aaron + claude.ai adversarial review session

## Claim

For a multi-agent system where agents are Turing-complete,
the problem of determining whether the current failure-mode
taxonomy is complete (i.e., no novel failure class will ever
be observed) is undecidable.

Consequence: new shadow classes will keep appearing. The
taxonomy can never be proven complete. The shadow log is a
sustainable learning resource by mathematical necessity,
not by empirical hope.

## Definitions

- **Agent A**: a function from task specifications to
  observable behavior. A(S) = behavior on spec S.
- **Failure mode F**: a predicate over behavior.
  F(A(S)) = true iff the behavior exhibits failure mode F.
- **Taxonomy T**: a finite set of failure-mode predicates
  {F₁, F₂, ..., Fₙ}.
- **Taxonomy completeness**: for all reachable specs S,
  if A(S) exhibits any failure, then some Fᵢ ∈ T classifies it.
- **Novel failure**: a behavior A(S) that exhibits a failure
  not classified by any Fᵢ ∈ T.

## Prerequisites

**P1. Agents are Turing-complete.** LLM agents with tool
use can simulate arbitrary computation given sufficient
context. This is empirically demonstrated (LLMs can
implement interpreters, solve arbitrary coding problems,
simulate state machines). For the formal argument, we
require only that the agent's behavior space is at least
as expressive as a universal Turing machine.

**P2. The taxonomy is a semantic property.** "This behavior
exhibits failure mode F" is a statement about the meaning
of the output, not its syntactic form. Two syntactically
different outputs can exhibit the same failure mode
(confident-fabrication can look like many different wrong
answers). Two syntactically similar outputs can exhibit
different failure modes (or none).

## Proof sketch

**By Rice's theorem** (Rice 1953): for any non-trivial
semantic property P of the partial functions computed by
Turing machines, the set {M : the function computed by M
has property P} is undecidable.

**Application (over agent programs):** Let P be the
property "there exists some task specification S on which
A exhibits a failure mode not in taxonomy T." This is a
semantic property of the agent's computed function — it
depends on what the function A computes, not on A's
syntactic encoding. It is non-trivial: some agent
implementations exhibit novel failures on some input (the
shadow log has 30+ catches), and some do not.

Therefore, by Rice's theorem, the set of agent
implementations that will ever exhibit a novel failure is
undecidable. No algorithm can determine, from an arbitrary
agent's program description, whether it will ever produce
a failure outside T.

**Extension to inputs (via halting-problem reduction):**
Since agents are Turing-complete (prerequisite P1), we can
encode an arbitrary Turing machine M as a task
specification S_M such that A(S_M) simulates M. Deciding
whether A(S_M) exhibits a novel failure for a given input
S_M is then at least as hard as the halting problem, which
is undecidable. Therefore the set of inputs S for which
A(S) exhibits a novel failure is also undecidable — but
the route is via halting-problem reduction, not Rice's
theorem directly.

**Corollary:** taxonomy completeness is undecidable. You
cannot prove that T covers all possible failure modes over
arbitrary inputs, because deciding completeness would
require solving the above undecidable problem.

## What this proves and what it doesn't

**Proves:**
- Over the full space of task specifications, failure-mode
  classification completeness is undecidable (Rice's theorem
  over agent programs + halting-problem reduction for inputs)
- No static finite taxonomy can be proven complete for an
  arbitrary Turing-complete agent

**Supported separately (by diagonalization, not Rice's theorem):**
- For any finite taxonomy T, we can construct a task
  specification S such that A(S) produces behavior that
  no Fᵢ ∈ T classifies — because A's Turing-completeness
  lets it simulate arbitrary computations. This means new
  failure instances are inexhaustible over arbitrary inputs.
  Note: this does not imply infinitely many distinct failure
  *classes* — a finite set of class descriptions can remain
  fixed while membership remains undecidable.

**Does not prove:**
- That every tick produces a novel class (empirically,
  most ticks produce known classes — the distribution is
  long-tailed, not uniform)
- Computational irreducibility in Wolfram's specific sense
  (that's a stronger claim about the absence of ANY
  shortcut, not just taxonomy completeness)
- That the shadow log is useful forever on a FIXED task
  distribution (Rice's theorem applies to arbitrary inputs;
  a narrow task distribution might have a complete taxonomy)

## Relationship to Wolfram's irreducibility

Wolfram's computational irreducibility (A New Kind of
Science, 2002) claims that some processes have no
computational shortcut — the only way to know what they
do is to run them. This is related but distinct:

- **Rice's theorem** → you can't decide semantic properties
  of programs in general (undecidability)
- **Wolfram irreducibility** → you can't skip ahead in the
  computation (no shortcut exists)

Rice's is about WHAT the program computes.
Wolfram's is about HOW FAST you can predict it.

For the shadow log, Rice's theorem is sufficient: you
can't prove the taxonomy is complete. You don't need
Wolfram's stronger claim.

## Relationship to Class 4 (claude.ai framing)

The empirical observation (Class 4 behavior) and the
theoretical result (Rice's theorem) are complementary:

- **Rice's theorem** explains WHY new classes keep appearing
  (undecidability of taxonomy completeness)
- **Class 4** describes HOW they appear (recurring patterns
  with a long tail of novelty, not uniformly random)

The Class 4 framing is the empirical description.
Rice's theorem is the theoretical explanation.
Neither requires Wolfram's full irreducibility claim.
