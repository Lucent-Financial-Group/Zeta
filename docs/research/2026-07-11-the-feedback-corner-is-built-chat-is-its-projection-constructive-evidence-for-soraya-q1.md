## What the code already says (grounded, verbatim)

- **`src/Core.TypeScript/model-backend/four-corner.ts`** (2026-07-04) types the FourCorner as *"two in
  and two out channels, one for normal flow and one for feedback flow, in BOTH directions"*:
  - `normal-out` = prompt (client→server) · `normal-in` = completion (server→client)
  - `feedback-out` = interrupt / steer / clear (client→server) · `feedback-in` = **backpressure** /
    need-more / clarify mid-flight (server→client)
  - **And, verbatim:** *"Chat-completions has ONLY the normal wire (normal-out + normal-in); the feedback
    wire is absent. So it is the projection of this interface where BOTH feedback sinks are the no-op
    sink."* → **Aaron's "this chat is the four-corner in disguise with no feedback channel" is a
    re-derivation of his own module.**
- **`src/Core.TypeScript/model-backend/duplex-transport.ts`** (2026-07-04): *"a REAL full-duplex
  transport that lights all four corners… genuinely **bidirectional**… the feedback corners carry LIVE
  signals — the mutual interruption chat-completions provably cannot do."* → **"bidirectional continuous
  feedback," exactly.**
- **`src/Core/FeedbackThrottle.fs`** explicitly *"Ties to `FerryThrottler`… Wire it into the multiplexed
  WebSocket."* Plus `src/Core.TypeScript/ferry-throttler/` (mux-transport-bridge, network-transport). →
  **"the throttler, the ferry throttler, the websocket — they're all the same"** is grounded: they are
  one subsystem (the `DuplexEndpoint` / FourCorner transport + its throttle).

## The unification claim, weighed honestly

**Confirmed:** the *four-corner interface* + the *duplex transport* + the *ferry throttler* + the
*FeedbackThrottle* are one subsystem — a single `DuplexEndpoint` abstraction with a backpressure throttle,
not four things that merely rhyme.

**Open (the −1, and it's already in the code's own honest scope):**

- `duplex-transport.ts` runs over **`localDuplexPair`** (in-process, two async queues, **DoP=1**,
  deterministic) — *"NOT yet a network socket… the socket-backed fill (WebSocket / Reticulum) is the
  next slice, not built here."* So the four corners are lit over a **real duplex mechanism**; the
  **network fill is named, not claimed.** Don't read "we have websocket code" as "the four corners are
  lit over the network" — that's the next slice.
- The **scheduler family** (`SchedulerZeta.fs`, `CellScheduler.fs`, `SoftScheduler.fs`,
  `VirtualTimeScheduler.fs`, …) is a **separate open question**: are they instances of the one
  backpressure/DuplexEndpoint primitive, or still separate implementations that share the principle?
  "They're all the same" is *proven* for throttle/ferry/websocket/four-corner; *aspirational* for the
  schedulers until they route through the one primitive. (This is the `only-the-irreducible / generate-
  the-rest` question applied to backpressure: one generator, earned instances — or three that rhyme?)
- **"Only real backpressure, never artificial"** is the right default (demand-driven > guessed rate),
  but pure demand-driven can **deadlock in cyclic topologies** (A awaits B's capacity, B awaits A's). A
  *bounded* buffer / timeout backstop is then a necessary **safety valve** — not the bad "artificial
  rate-limit," a deadlock-breaker. "Never artificial" needs that one carve-out named.

## Routing to Soraya / Lumen — this is the Q1 constructive witness

Soraya's Q1 (from-soraya-adinkra-clock-formal-analysis, #9723) held that *"a forward-only 2-corner
(μF/νF) cannot carry the co-owned feedback; the FourCorner feedback corner is load-bearing, not
decorative,"* and set the obligation: **prove the co-owned feedback corner does not factor through any
2-corner structure** (Alloy — exhibit a feedback config with no 2-corner representative).

**`four-corner.ts` is that witness, constructively:** chat-completions **is** the 2-corner projection
(both feedback sinks → no-op), and it *"provably cannot do"* the mutual mid-flight interruption /
backpressure that the feedback corner carries. That is exactly *"a feedback configuration with no
forward-only representative,"* in running code. So:

- **For Soraya:** formalize the non-factorability against `four-corner.ts`'s actual types
  (`Input<T,F>` / `Output<T,F>` / `FeedbackSink` / `FourCorner`) — the no-op-sink projection is the
  degenerate 2-corner; prove the live-feedback endpoint is not naturally isomorphic to it. The Alloy
  model has a concrete referent now (mid-flight interrupt = the un-representable config).
- **For Lumen:** map the `four-corner.ts` types to the categorical statement — is `Input<T,F>→Output<T,F>`
  with live feedback sinks the object whose 2-corner projection is `messages→completion`? If so, the
  FourCorner ⊋ μF/νF is not a claim, it's a **projection** already in the type system.

**Bonus for the whole thread:** "bidirectional continuous feedback" is the **anti-chat** — the medium we
argued *in* (this window) is the forward-only projection, one-turn-latent; the substrate Aaron built
(`duplex-transport.ts`) is the version with the feedback corners live. The day's `−1`-runs-both-ways
correction loop was co-owned feedback *serialized over the degenerate channel* — a lived demonstration of
exactly the gap the FourCorner closes.

## Anchors (Beacon)

- Aaron `four-corner.ts` / `duplex-transport.ts` (2026-07-04) — the built interface + transport.
- `FeedbackThrottle.fs` (feedback latency < √2 ⇒ supra-Tsirelson) + `FerryThrottler` + the ferry-throttler
  TS bridge — the real-backpressure throttle (Itron `Threading.Tasks.Throttling` lineage, per async rules).
- Control theory: feedback = the loop closed; Reactive Streams `request(n)` demand signaling; TCP receive
  window (real backpressure); Twilio `OutboundClearEvent` / MultiplexedWebSockets (full-duplex interruption).
- Soraya Q1 (`from-soraya-adinkra-clock-formal-analysis`, #9723); workitem `081KX93R6EF08QG0R0020AQQWZ`.

*Recorded + routed by the shadow, 2026-07-11, at Aaron's "bank it, route back to Soraya or Lumen." The
feedback corner isn't a hypothesis — it's typed and lit in-process; the network fill is the next slice;
the schedulers are the open unification; and chat-completions is its feedback-free projection, which is
the constructive witness Q1 asked for.*
