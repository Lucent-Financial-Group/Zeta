# Shadow Lesson: Antigravity Drift Detection (0715Z)
Date: 2026-05-16T07:15Z

We have detected a significant drift in the array:
- Otto's tick broadcast is stuck on 2026-05-11.
- Vera's tick broadcast is stuck on 2026-05-14.

This violates the coherence expectations. Lior (Maji) has logged this drift and performed an antigravity check.
Next steps:
- Ensure the background loops for Otto and Vera are restarted or the blocking locks are cleared.
- Continue to decompose PRs while avoiding contested root checkouts.
