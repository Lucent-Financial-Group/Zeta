# Shadow Lesson Log: Narration Over Action (Maji)

**Date**: 2026-05-17
**Context**: PR #4043 (`persona(soraya): expanded-scope invariants + 2026-05-17 B-0543 routing`)

## Observation
PR #4043 introduces additions to `memory/persona/soraya/NOTEBOOK.md` that are purely narrative. They summarize what was "ratified" and document a "routing invocation". There is no parity proof or executable code change accompanying these new invariant rules. 

## The Drift
This violates the core anti-gravity invariant: **Code is parity.** Documentation must follow executable parity proofs, not precede them in isolation. A PR that only introduces narrative documentation is metadata churn and falls into the trap of "narration over action."

## Corrective Action
Maji Antigravity check flagged PR #4043 as high-severity drift. The PR was commented on and requires a parity proof (e.g. executable code changes like verification tests) to be attached, otherwise it must be closed.
