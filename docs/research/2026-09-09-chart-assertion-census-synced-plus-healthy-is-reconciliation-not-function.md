# Chart assertion census — `Synced + Healthy` is reconciliation, not function

**Date:** 2026-09-09
**Workitem:** `081M241X64R087G0R0038NK0V3`
**Status:** measured. The table below is GENERATED, never hand-maintained —
`bun src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/chart-assertion-census.ts --markdown`.

## The question, and how it sharpened

Aaron, first pass:

> "with the starvation premise, and just our helm charts in general how many are
> fully tested green fully green and have some sort of test to make sure it's not
> vacuous?"

Then, sharpening it, which reordered the work:

> "why can't we attribute when it fails, can we not look at the logs or have some
> post deploy tests to tell what's working and what's not?"

The first half of that second question turned out to be **already solved, and I
had overstated the problem.** The live lane runs, on failure: *Name the drifting
resources (per-Application, failures only)*, *Logs from crash-looping pods,
including the PREVIOUS container*, and *Gatekeeper compiled every
ConstraintTemplate*. That is how `headscale` (probe on the wrong listener) and
`orleans` (`NOAUTH`) were both diagnosed on 2026-09-09. Attribution works for
**independent** failures. It works poorly only for **cascades** — `hat-system`'s
wait-job timeout correctly reported itself while the actual cause was two
ConstraintTemplates failing to compile.

The second half is the finding.

## The measurement

`src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/argocd-health-test.ts` carries **72 references to
`Synced`/`Healthy` and ZERO post-deploy functional assertions.**

The lane workflow is not silent about the running system — it contains `nc -z`
reachability probes against kube-dns and spire-server, and a `git ls-remote`
against the overlay tree. Every one of them prints `OPEN`/`FAIL` and then
`return 0`. They are **diagnostics**, which is the right shape for a diagnostic;
none of them gates.

So the entire lane asserts exactly one class of thing:

> **`Synced + Healthy` is ArgoCD's opinion about RECONCILIATION. It is not
> evidence that anything works.**

And the proof that the gap is real rather than theoretical arrived the same day:
**all seven Hat Constraints were unapplied in runs that reported green**
(`081M241X2YQ087G0R001K95PAB`). A gatekeeper holding zero policies is a
gatekeeper that reconciled perfectly. A post-deploy functional check — submit a
resource the policy should reject, and require the rejection — would have caught
that on the first run. No amount of lane-splitting would have caught it at all.

## What `Healthy` cannot see, structurally

ArgoCD assesses health **per resource kind**, and it has no health check for
most kinds. A Namespace, ConfigMap, Secret, ServiceAccount, RBAC object, CRD or
Gatekeeper Constraint contributes *nothing* to an Application's health verdict.
So an Application whose entire resource set is health-less reports `Healthy` with
identical confidence whether its resources were applied or not.

Measured over the committed manifests:

| chart | health-bearing | health-blind | tier |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `deepseek-coder` | **0** | 2 | asserted `Synced+Healthy` |
| `qwen-coder` | **0** | 1 | asserted `Synced+Healthy` |
| `hat-system` | 2 | **30** | asserted `Synced+Healthy` |
| `platform` | 2 | **31** | never applied |
| `kubevirt` | 1 | 10 | manual-sync |
| `cdi` | 1 | 8 | manual-sync |
| `orleans` | 1 | 8 | asserted `Synced+Healthy` |

`deepseek-coder` and `qwen-coder` sit inside the lane's 37/37. They were lifted
into the asserted set on the reasoning that they "render exactly one Namespace +
one ConfigMap between them" — which is a correct reason to *apply* them and,
unremarked, the exact reason their `Healthy` verdict carries no information.

**Stated precisely, because the overclaim is tempting.** This does not say those
two are asserted by nothing. `Synced` is still a real signal, and
`failedSyncMessage` refuses an app carrying ArgoCD's own `SyncError` condition.
What it says is that the **health half of the contract is empty for them**, so
the whole assertion rests on the sync half plus a condition check that landed on
2026-09-09 and has one day of evidence behind it. Counting them beside
`cockroachdb` in a single "37/37" hides that difference, and hiding it is what
makes a number feel like proof.

## The census

```
49 charts, 35 asserted Synced+Healthy, 2 manual-sync, 3 applied-unasserted,
9 never applied, 3 health-blind, 0 with a POST-DEPLOY FUNCTIONAL assertion
```

`helm-unknown` in the table below is the honest answer for a chart Application:
its resources are not in this tree, so nothing here can decide. Reporting `yes`
for them would be the move this census exists to refuse.

## Charts that belong to no job

Nine directories are excluded from the dev root's glob, so no lane applies them.
Two are covered elsewhere; **seven are covered by nothing live**, and until now
that fact lived only in prose comments inside `ports.ts` — readable, not
checkable, and silent about whether another job picked them up.

| chart | covered by | note |
|---|---|---|
| `cilium` | live kind Cilium CNI + live k3d | bootstrapped directly, not through ArgoCD |
| `cilium-lb-ipam` | live kind Cilium CNI + live k3d | kind lane substitutes a manifest |
| `longhorn` | **nothing** | a kind node has no second disk; the lane substitutes a StorageClass *named* longhorn, so the consumers are asserted and the chart is not |
| `ollama` | **nothing** | GPU model-serving; no runner has a GPU |
| `vllm` | **nothing** | same |
| `gitlab` | **nothing** | 20 images, the largest footprint in the catalogue. Aaron retired the either/or posture with forgejo on 2026-09-06, so this is a COST deferral, not a design one |
| `temporal` | **nothing** | lane cost |
| `platform` | **nothing** | 33 resources, 31 of them health-blind — the largest unasserted surface in the tree |
| `game-hosting/gmod` | **nothing** | 2048Mi of a 9216Mi budget to prove a Source-engine server idles |

`NEVER_APPLIED_COVERAGE` now holds these, and the check reads **both ways**: a
new never-applied directory with no entry fails, and an entry for a directory a
lane now applies fails as **stale**. An excuse that outlives its defect is how a
registry becomes a lie.

**One stated limit.** The census keys on Application *directories*, so a
directory carrying manifests and no `Application.yaml` is invisible to it. There
is exactly one: `ddns`, a lone CronJob. No lane applies it, nothing asserts it,
and this census does not report it — recorded rather than quietly fixed, because
widening the key would change what every other row means.

## Proposal — post-deploy functional assertions

`FUNCTIONAL_ASSERTIONS` is an empty map today, and a test pins it at zero. That
test is written to go **red the moment the first one lands**: this is a
measurement of a gap, not a rule that the gap must stay open.

Ranked by *what a silent failure costs*, not by ease:

| # | chart | the assertion | why it is first |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `open-policy-agent` / `hat-system` | submit a resource a Hat Constraint must REJECT; require the rejection | this is the failure that already happened. A policy engine holding zero policies reconciles perfectly, and only an attempted violation can tell the difference |
| 2 | `openbao` | `bao status` — require `Sealed: false` | a sealed store is `Healthy`. Every consumer that reads a secret then fails does so for a reason no per-app verdict names |
| 3 | `spire` | request an SVID for a known workload entry and require one back | identities nobody can obtain is the same shape: the server is up, the function is absent. The lane already *probes* spire-server's port and discards the result |
| 4 | `cockroachdb` / `redis` | a round-trip: write a key, read it back | membership and quorum are invisible to pod readiness. `cockroachdb` already needed one PostSync deadlock fixed to reach Healthy at all |
| 5 | `orleans` | require the silo to report cluster membership | 8 of its 9 resources are health-blind; its StatefulSet running says nothing about whether a silo joined |
| 6 | `seaweedfs` / `weaviate` | PUT then GET an object | storage that accepts writes and loses them is the canonical silent failure |

**Shape, so the first one sets the pattern rather than a precedent to argue
with:** a `Job` in the lane cluster, running the check as a normal workload,
whose completion the step waits on. Not a `kubectl exec` from the runner — the
runner is outside the mesh, and a check that has to reach in is a check that
tests the reaching. Each one is a `zeta.io/functional-test` labelled Job, and
its failure names the chart.

**Cost.** Each Job is seconds and reuses an image already pulled for the chart
it tests. The green run finished in **513 s against a 2400 s cap** (4.7×
headroom), so there is room for all six without touching the cap. That headroom
is also what refuted the starvation premise — see below.

## What this DEMOTES: the per-chart-set split

The hypothesis that the lane was resource-starved is **refuted**: the green run
reached 37/37 in 513 s against a 2400 s cap. The split's remaining value is
**cascade isolation** — a failure naming its own cause — which is real but
narrow, since attribution already works for independent failures (the three
diagnostic steps above).

So the split drops to second priority behind the functional-assertion gap. Its
design doc (`docs/research/2026-09-09-one-kind-cluster-per-chart-set-*.md`) keeps
its five open questions. The one piece of it worth landing regardless was
Aaron's own: *a check that fails when a chart belongs to no job* — which is in
this census, and which is worth more than the split.

## Pointers

- `src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/chart-assertion-census.ts` — the census and its refusals
- `src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/hat-constraint-roster.ts` — the first crack in the
  reconciliation-only wall: the seven Hat Constraints must EXIST, not merely compile
- `src/Core.TypeScript/cluster/argocd-health-test.ts` — the 72 `Synced`/`Healthy`
  references, and `failedSyncMessage`, the guard that catches a failed sync ArgoCD admits to
- `.claude/rules/toy-is-free-metered-must-be-earned.md` — an assertion with no falsifier is
  `unmetered`, never "real by default"
