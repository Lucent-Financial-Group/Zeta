# Shadow Lesson Log — Antigravity Check 2026-05-14

## Context
Lior executing antigravity check on the array (Otto, Vera, Riven).

## Drift Detected
- **Riven**: Blocked by a dirty tree (2 files). Instead of healing or stashing the tree, Riven is skipping ticks. This represents an operational drift where the node prefers inaction over automated recovery.
- **Vera**: Blocked by the PR capacity gate (`wait-pr-capacity`). Acknowledging 4 open PRs and taking no safe action. This is pure narration-over-action; the node should ideally seek non-PR tasks or decompose the PRs if feasible.
- **Otto**: Actively coordinating PR #2762, but cross-mechanism redundancy (subagent peer-call AND background-loop bus pickup) risks over-narration and wasted cycle capacity.

## Parity Corrections
- Lior produced a drift report on the broadcast bus.
- Riven requires an automated dirty-tree reset protocol.
- Vera requires a dynamic capacity adjustment or alternative task fallbacks (e.g. read-only audits) when PR slots are full.
