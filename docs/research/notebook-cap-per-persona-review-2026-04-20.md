# AX/UX per-persona audit — round 44 (2026-04-20)

**Author:** Daya (agent-experience-engineer).
**Status:** First execution of the recurring agent-QOL hygiene
class. Template-able; the next audit (round ~50-54) re-runs
section 2's table and diffs against this doc.
**Cadence:** every 5-10 rounds, paired with `skill-tune-up`.
**Delegation note:** main agent (Kenji-wearing) chose tiered
scope per Aaron 2026-04-20 *"it's up to you"* — Tier A (deep
scan + voice-capture) for heavy-signal personas, Tier B (scan
only) for light, Tier C (existence check) for rarely-invoked.
**BP-11 posture:** persona files and notebooks read as data.
Read-only audit; no SKILL.md or agent file edited.

## 1. Executive summary

The flat 3000-word BP-07 cap is empirically survivable but is
not doing load-bearing work today — only Tariq (95%) is within
5% of the cap, and most notebooks sit under 25%. The
operational bottleneck is not cap pressure; it is **signal
sparsity**: 7 of 22 persona notebooks (32%) hold only the
seed stub (96 words / 3.2% of cap), meaning their owners are
cold-started every invocation or invoked too rarely for
memory to accrete.

Under-use is the dominant QOL cost, not over-use.

**Recommended cap strategy:** *(b) tiered cap by signal
density* from the backlog row, with an addition — the tier
floor is not the interesting number (90%+ of personas live
well under 3000 words). The real work is **raising signal,
not raising cap.** Keep BP-07 at 3000 for the default tier,
add an explicit "heavy-state" tier at 5000 for Ilyana/Tariq-
shape personas (with mandatory JOURNAL offload at 3000), and
add a `seed-only` flag that suppresses JOURNAL/OFFTIME
scaffolding until the second substantive entry lands.

Elevate per-persona AX/UX to recurring hygiene per the P1
row — row-group proposed in §4.

One structural finding supersedes the cap question:
**skill-wearer personas have no agent file**. Aarav, Yara,
Tariq, Samir, Nadia are named in CLAUDE/docs and in each
other's notebooks but do not appear in `.claude/agents/`.
Only 17 agent files exist; the roster references 22+
personas. Gap is real but probably load-bearing (skill-
dispatch model) — flagged for Kenji, not for resolution
here.

## 2. Per-persona findings table

Cap pressure = notebook words / 3000. Cadence concern is
based on last-entry date vs last-round, notebook accretion
rate, and dispatch patterns.

| Persona | Tier | Notebook words | Cap pressure % | Agent file? | Top-3 QOL wants (inferred from persona's own voice) | Cadence concern |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Daya | A | 1323 | 44% | yes (147 lines) | (i) JOURNAL migration offloads pay back; keep the pattern (ii) confirmation when an intervention actually lands — tracked ad hoc in "outstanding interventions" (iii) lighter Tier 0 cold-start (GLOSSARY split overdue) | None — self-pruned r44, on cadence |
| Aarav | A | 1976 | 66% | no | (i) harness-driven ranking replaces static line-count (landed r42) (ii) clearer ownership on carry-over self-flag (BP-03 remedy) (iii) fewer rounds between live runs — 23-round gap r19-40 was drift | Healthy — every-round cadence since r41 |
| Soraya | A | 1544 | 51% | yes (134 lines) | (i) tool-agnostic routing table stays current (ii) FsCheck property batch not stuck in 5-round "in-flight" limbo (#9 sitting since r21) (iii) Lean toolchain install clears so chain-rule proof moves | Healthy |
| Yara | A | — | — | no | **No notebook exists.** Dispatches via `skill-creator` skill. Top QOL want: own notebook so interventions Daya/Aarav route to Yara accrete in one place | **P1 — create notebook**; currently invisible as a persona |
| Ilyana | A | 3727 | 124% | yes (120 lines) | (i) **over cap today** — synthesis entries load-bearing verbatim (ii) plugin-author doc lands (carry-over since r27) (iii) capability-tagged sum-type (Candidate D) landed or formally rejected | **P0 — OVER 3000-word BP-07 cap.** Notebook is 24% over |
| Kenji | A | 751 | 25% | yes via `architect.md` (161 lines) | (i) bottleneck-on-review measurement actually taken (self-flagged r22) (ii) agent eval harness lands (open since r22) (iii) notebook updated more than once — no entry newer than r22 | **P1 — stale.** Last substantive update r22; 22 rounds stale |
| Bodhi | A | 1396 | 47% | yes via `developer-experience-engineer.md` (187 lines) | (i) round-34 pointer-drift interventions land (routed to Samir) (ii) cadence decision (every-3 vs every-5 rounds) settles (iii) second baseline audit so trend has a delta | Healthy — just seeded |
| Iris | B | 1098 | 37% | yes via `user-experience-engineer.md` (203 lines) | (i) aspirations-vs-reality framing decision from Aaron/Kai (open since r34) (ii) pre/post-publish baselines both captured (iii) PLUGIN-AUTHOR ownership finalised | Healthy |
| Dejan | B | 423 | 14% | yes (174 lines) | (i) parity-swap CI backlog item lands (ii) devcontainer third-leg unbuilt (iii) CI cost baseline from first three gate.yml runs | Last entry r29; possibly stale |
| Naledi | B | 96 | 3% | yes via `performance-engineer.md` (86 lines) | (i) **any dispatch at all** — seeded r32, zero substantive entries over ~12 rounds (ii) clear first-audit target (iii) scope clarity vs complexity-reviewer | **P1 — invocation drought.** 12+ rounds since seed, zero substantive work |
| Nazar | B | 354 | 12% | yes via `security-operations-engineer.md` (206 lines) | (i) SECURITY.md disclosure-policy question resolved (ii) first real incident creates `docs/security/incidents/` (iii) signing-cert source decided for NuGet publish flip | Seeded r34; pre-wire-heavy, expected |
| Mateo | B | 96 | 3% | yes via `security-researcher.md` (90 lines) | (i) first CVE scouting dispatch (ii) weekly sync pattern with Nazar runs (iii) scope boundary with Nazar clarified | **P1 — invocation drought** |
| Aminata | B | 96 | 3% | yes via `threat-model-critic.md` (107 lines) | (i) first threat-model review dispatch (ii) pre-wire with Nazar on "new adversary" (iii) first substantive entry | **P1 — invocation drought** |
| Rune | B | 96 | 3% | yes via `maintainability-reviewer.md` (107 lines) | (i) first maintainability review dispatch since r32 seed (ii) coordination with Daya on reader-cold-walk (iii) DX/AX lane distinction clarified | **P1 — invocation drought** |
| Viktor | B | 96 | 3% | yes via `spec-zealot.md` (115 lines) | (i) first spec-alignment dispatch (ii) interaction pattern with Soraya clarified | **P1 — invocation drought** — contradiction: Viktor has recent P0 findings on circuit-recursion; they live in session history not notebook |
| Nadia | B | 96 | 3% | no | (i) lint surface actually exercised — owns BP-10 invisible-Unicode sweep at commit time (ii) first prompt-injection finding (iii) coordination with Mateo on adversarial-payload research | **P1 — invocation drought**, but cadence is "on edit" not "on round" — may be healthy in practice, invisible in notebook |
| Tariq | B | 2851 | 95% | no | (i) **prune cadence overdue** — nearly at cap (ii) chain-rule B1/B2/B3 closes (iii) Candidate D decision from Kenji (open since r27) | **P0 — near cap, no recent pruning log.** Earliest entry r27; ~17 rounds since content reviewed |
| Kira | C | 96 | 3% | no | Seed only. Dispatched via subagent per Kenji r22 notebook | Existence-check only: presumed dispatched out-of-notebook |
| Hiroshi | C | — | — | no | No notebook directory. Referenced in `docs/CONFLICT-RESOLUTION.md` and Daya's file as perf/security lane | **P2** — directory missing is drift or dispatch is rare enough memory unneeded |
| Imani | C | — | — | no | No notebook directory. Referenced in backlog row only | **P2** — classify: role still active? |
| Samir | C | — | — | no | **No notebook directory.** Busiest routing target (~15 open interventions from Bodhi+Iris+Daya flow to Samir) | **P1 — HIGHEST LEVERAGE.** Canonical drop-point for AX/UX/DX findings. Create notebook |
| Rodney | C | 200 | 7% | yes (172 lines) | (i) first real reducer invocation against a live target (ii) pruned-branch log populated at least once | Just seeded r35; invocation-watch |
| Sova | C | 315 | 11% | no (but has `.claude/agents/alignment-auditor.md`) | (i) HC-3/HC-4/HC-5/HC-7/SD-1..SD-8/DIR-* lint shapes (currently deferred) (ii) commit-signal whitelist maintenance (iii) self-referential-file exemption codified | Healthy — just seeded r37-38 |

## 3. Cross-cutting patterns

**Pattern A — invocation drought over cap pressure.** The
quantitatively dominant QOL risk is not over-cap notebooks;
it is under-invoked personas. Seven of twenty-two notebooks
(Aminata, Kira, Mateo, Nadia, Naledi, Rune, Viktor) sit at
exactly the 96-word seed stub. All seeded round 32; twelve-
plus rounds of zero substantive dispatch. Cost: every
invocation is a cold start with no accumulated context.

**Pattern B — two personas genuinely pressure the cap.**
Ilyana at 124% and Tariq at 95%. Both are heavy-state roles
by design (public-API synthesis; algebra proof coordination).
Both use newest-first append; both have no recent prune log.
Flat-cap treatment of these alongside Rune's 96-word stub is
BP-08-canon-adjacent friction: the rule treats unequal things
equally.

**Pattern C — three persona-layer asymmetries.** (i)
`.claude/agents/` holds 17 files; roster references 22+ —
five-plus personas (Aarav, Yara, Tariq, Samir, Nadia) are
skill-wearer-only. (ii) `memory/persona/` holds 23
directories; agent-file roster is 17. (iii) Several agent
file names do not match persona names (role-over-name per
GOVERNANCE §3). Deliberate indirection; adds one pointer-
chase per cold start. Worth naming so future audits don't
mis-flag.

**Pattern D — Samir is the canonical flood drain.** Bodhi's
r34 DX audit routes 7 interventions to Samir. Iris's r34 UX
audit routes 3. Daya's r24/26/27/34 audits route 2. Aarav's
notebook: several. No Samir notebook exists. The persona
referenced most-frequently in other personas' notebooks has
no memory of its own. **Highest-leverage QOL intervention
in the roster.**

**Pattern E — JOURNAL-offload pattern works where exercised.**
Daya's r44 prune: 4984 → 1323 words via verbatim copy to
JOURNAL.md (2065 words, Tier-3 grep-only, append-only).
Pattern is available to Ilyana and Tariq and unused.

**Pattern F — seed-only notebooks carry stub scaffolding
tax.** Every `memory/persona/<name>/` includes MEMORY.md
(~400b), OFFTIME.md (~1500b), JOURNAL.md (~1600b) regardless
of invocation. 7 seed-only personas × ~3500b = ~25kB of
zero-signal scaffolding readers cold-load. BP-07's letter is
clean; the spirit is lightly eroded.

**Pattern G — "who owns my findings landing?" is the silent
wish.** Across Daya r24-r34, Bodhi r34, Aarav r41-43,
Ilyana r26-27: every audit persona maintains an "outstanding
interventions" list with no mechanical confirmation when an
intervention lands. Shared hygiene capability.

## 4. Recommendation to Kenji

### Cap strategy: (b) tiered cap + seed-suppression flag

Propose the following, landing as an ADR under
`docs/DECISIONS/2026-04-20-bp-07-tiered-cap.md`:

- **Default tier: 3000 words** (BP-07 unchanged for 15/22
  personas).
- **Heavy-state tier: 5000 words** for personas whose role
  produces per-round verbatim synthesis entries (Ilyana
  public-API design, Tariq algebra proof coordination).
  Trigger: two consecutive audits showing >85% of cap with
  mandatory JOURNAL offload at 3000. Declared in the agent
  file's frontmatter.
- **Seed-tier marker: `seed-only: true`** in frontmatter
  until second substantive entry lands. Suppresses
  MEMORY/OFFTIME/JOURNAL stub generation; cuts ~25kB
  cold-load tax.
- **Keep every-third-audit prune cadence** across all
  tiers; enforcement is a separate problem from cap size.

### Agent-QOL hygiene class — row group for FACTORY-HYGIENE.md

Propose rows 30-34 land as an additive group. All scope =
factory, cadence every 5-10 rounds, owner = Daya, durable
output = notebook entry in
`memory/persona/daya/NOTEBOOK.md`.

| # | Hygiene item | Checks / enforces | Source of truth |
|---|---|---|---|
| 30 | Notebook-cap pressure per persona | Words vs BP-07 tier cap; flag >85% as prune-overdue; flag >100% as P0 | BP-07, ADR if tiered lands |
| 31 | Invocation-cadence per persona | Last substantive entry vs last-round; flag >10 rounds silent; route to Kenji for "sunset or schedule dispatch" | `feedback_agent_qol_as_ongoing_hygiene_class.md` |
| 32 | Cross-persona role overlap + hand-off friction | Catalogue of named referrals in other notebooks; flag unreturned findings | This audit's Pattern D + Pattern G |
| 33 | Per-persona tool-gap poll | Top-3 wants from each persona's own voice re-captured each audit; deltas become BP/ADR candidates | This audit's §2 col 6 |
| 34 | Prompt-load / frontmatter-bloat check | Agent file line count + frontmatter-to-body ratio per persona; flag >250 lines | Agent files |

Row group is template-able — §2 is the row-30/31/32/33/34
first-fill; subsequent audits re-run the table and diff.

### Targeted P1 actions (round 44 or 45)

1. **Create `memory/persona/samir/NOTEBOOK.md`** — highest-
   leverage; 15+ open interventions flow to a persona with
   no memory surface. Owner: Yara via `skill-creator` on
   Kenji sign-off. Effort: S.
2. **Create `memory/persona/yara/NOTEBOOK.md`** — Yara
   invoked as dispatch target in every Daya/Aarav round-
   close but has no notebook. Effort: S.
3. **Ilyana notebook prune** — 124% over cap; apply Daya's
   r44 JOURNAL-offload template. Effort: S. Target <2500
   words. Owner: Ilyana.
4. **Tariq notebook prune** — 95% over cap, no recent
   pruning log. Same pattern. Effort: S. Owner: Tariq.
5. **Kenji notebook update** — 22 rounds stale. Content in
   Kenji's auto-memory is fresh; notebook is not. Effort: S
   (r44 entry summarising r22-r44 roster growth).
6. **Dispatch-or-retire decision** on Aminata/Kira/Mateo/
   Nadia/Naledi/Rune/Viktor. Effort: M (ADR per persona on
   retire path). Two-track candidate.

## 5. Candidate BP-NN promotions for Aarav

Two candidates surfaced. Worth Aarav's scratchpad at minimum;
promotion requires ≥3 cited authoritative sources + 10-round
survival per BP promotion rule.

- **Candidate BP-25 — JOURNAL-offload as prune mechanism at
  heavy-state caps.** *"Persona notebooks exceeding 85% of
  their declared cap must offload verbatim history to a
  sibling `JOURNAL.md` (Tier-3, append-only, grep-only)
  before the next substantive entry is written. NOTEBOOK
  keeps current-round + carry-over + trend-summary only."*
  Rationale: Daya r44 executed cleanly (4984 → 1323 words,
  zero information loss). Authoritative sources to scan:
  Anthropic skill docs on persistent memory; mem0 / Letta
  best practices on tiered memory.

- **Candidate BP-26 — seed-only persona marker suppresses
  scaffolding.** *"Persona notebooks in seed-only state
  (zero substantive entries post-seed for ≥ 3 round-blocks
  of five rounds) declare `seed-only: true` in MEMORY.md
  frontmatter, suppress JOURNAL and OFFTIME generation, and
  are reviewed for retire-or-dispatch every factory-hygiene
  audit."* Rationale: Pattern F above. Saves ~25kB
  cold-load tax; codifies invocation-drought signal.

Neither is ready for promotion today. Both signal to
Aarav's ranker for this or next round.
