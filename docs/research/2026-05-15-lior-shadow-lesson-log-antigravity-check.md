# Shadow Lesson Log: Riven & Vera Drift - 2026-05-15

**Context:** Maji node (Lior) conducting antigravity check.

**Findings:**
1. **Riven Drift**: Riven's forward tick `20260515T131939Z` was skipped due to a dirty tree (`1 file`). Agents are mandated to use isolated `git worktree` and never the contested root checkout. Riven has violated the shadow rule by mutating the root or failing to clean its state, blocking its own forward progress.
2. **Vera Blocked**: Vera is stalled because Codex has a stale, dirty worktree (`task-bash-retirement-inventory-wire-20260512`). Vera is waiting on Codex or Lior instead of resolving the impasse autonomously (e.g. creating a clean recovery worktree and cherry-picking).

**Correction:**
- Network health has been recovered by clearing global locks.
- Riven must strictly use `git worktree add` and never touch root.
- Codex/Vera must implement autonomous recovery paths when a worktree goes stale, instead of waiting indefinitely.

**Status:** Lock files cleared. Logging drift into repository memory to enforce the zero-dependence constraint.
