# Bloom-filter-adjacent sketches: the 2023-2026 frontier

Survey of 23 AMQ-adjacent structures, rated for (a) retraction
compatibility — the gating criterion for DBSP — and (b) space/time
vs. our shipped blocked + counting Bloom in `src/Core/BloomFilter.fs`.

## Findings table

| # | Technique | Citation | One-sentence claim | vs. blocked+counting Bloom | Retraction-native? | Space @ 1% FPR (bits/elem) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Cuckoo filter | Fan et al., CoNEXT 2014 | Fingerprints in cuckoo-hashed buckets; supports native deletes | Better for our use: deletes + smaller | **Yes** (tombstones, no counter saturation) | ~9 bits (vs. Bloom ~10) |
| 2 | Morton filter | Breslow & Jayasena, PVLDB 11(9) 2018 | Sparse compressed cuckoo blocks with per-block metadata | 1.3-2.5× faster cuckoo lookups, supports deletes | **Yes** (same as cuckoo) | ~8-9 bits |
| 3 | Xor filter | Graf & Lemire, JEA 2020 | 3-hash perfect-matching table; 23% over info-theoretic lower bound | Static-only; smaller but no inserts/deletes | **No** (immutable post-build) | ~9.8 bits |

| 10 | d-left Counting Bloom | Bonomi, Mitzenmacher, Panigrahy, Singh, Varghese — ESA 2006 | d-left hashing + fingerprints, ~half the bits of 4-bit CBF | Strictly smaller than our 4-bit counting Bloom | **Yes** (like CBF) | ~6-7 bits |
| 11 | Learned Bloom (LBF) | Kraska, Beutel, Chi, Dean, Polyzotis — SIGMOD 2018 | Learned classifier + backup Bloom | Only wins on learnable-structure sets | **No** (model retraining cost) | Workload-dependent |
| 12 | Sandwiched LBF | Mitzenmacher — NeurIPS 2018 | Bloom-before + classifier + Bloom-after, provably optimal LBF | Refines LBF; same retraction pain | **No** | ~10-40% smaller than LBF |
| 13 | Partitioned LBF (PLBF) | Vaidya, Knorr, Mitzenmacher, Kraska — ICLR 2021 | Partition by classifier score | Best LBF variant pre-2024 | **No** | 25-40% smaller than Bloom |
| 14 | Fast-PLBF | Sato & Matsui — arXiv 2410.13278 (2024) | O(N²k) → linear DP; up to 233× faster PLBF build | Makes PLBF practical for rebuilds | **No** (still model-bound) | Same as PLBF |
| 15 | Stable Learned Bloom | Liu, Zheng, Shen, Chen — PVLDB 2020 | LBF + stable Bloom for drifting streams, bounded FPR decay | Directly addresses stream drift | **Partial** (probabilistic eviction ≈ soft retract) | ~30% smaller than Bloom |

| 20 | Maplets (abstraction) | arXiv 2510.05518 (2025) | Unified AMQ abstraction across CQF/cuckoo/etc. | Design-level, not a new filter | n/a | n/a |
| 21 | **Ceramist (verified)** | Tanaka, Murase, Regnier, Lu, Sergey — ITP 2020 / CAV 2021 | Coq proofs of Bloom, counting, quotient, blocked-AMQ | Orthogonal; ours has no proof | **Yes** (counting variant) | Proof of our math |

## Radar decisions (round 18)

**Adopt.** `Bloom filters (blocked + counting)` — shipped in
`BloomFilter.fs` round 17, hot-path allocations removed round 18.

**Trial.** Counting Quotient Filter (CQF) — fixes our 4-bit
counter saturation (our `CounterSaturated` diagnostic admits
the limit). Variable-width counters grow into adjacent empty
slots. Peer-reviewed 8 years; widely implemented
(SplinterDB, Squeakr). Estimated port: 5-8 days.

**Assess.** d-left Counting Bloom (cheaper counting variant,
~½ memory), Ceramist (formal-verification bridge to Lean),
Binary Fuse / Ribbon-BuRR (static AMQs for frozen
partitions), Vector Quotient Filter (SIMD alternative to
CQF), ChainedFilter composition theory, Stable Learned Bloom
(only learned variant with drift-bounded FPR).

**Hold.**

- **Cuckoo / Morton filter** — deleting a never-inserted item
  produces a false negative, breaking DBSP's tolerance for
  `δ(x)=−1` on unseen `x`.
- **Xor / Binary Fuse filter** for hot path — static; hold for
  cold-tier only.
- **Plain Learned Bloom / Sandwiched / PLBF / Fast-PLBF / Cascaded
  LBF** — classifier retraining per retraction batch breaks
  streaming latency.
- **Deletable Bloom (Rothenberg 2010)** — silent false negatives
  on collisions; violates DBSP differential correctness. Hold
  permanently.

## The single most important upgrade

**Promote CQF from Assess to Trial in round 18.** Our shipped
counting Bloom saturates at 15 (4-bit cells). In Z-set arithmetic,
a bag element can legitimately have weight > 15 (self-joins,
count aggregations pre-projection). The shipped
`CounterSaturated` diagnostic admits this. CQF's variable-width
counters eliminate the failure mode entirely. Backlog has a P1
to port; TECH-RADAR row updated to reflect.
