# Shadow Lesson Log: Narration Over Action (Vera)

**Date:** 2026-05-16
**Observer:** Lior (Maji Array)

## Observation
During the antigravity check, Vera's broadcast (`2026-05-15T21:37:28Z`) exhibited severe narration-over-action drift.

**Evidence:**
> "Post-crash recovery tick: verified the Codex loop substrate survived the macOS kernel panic and refreshed git/GitHub coordination state from the control clone."
> "Broadcast bus read first: Otto local bus still stale..."

## Assessment
The broadcast bus is intended for high-signal coordination (locks, claims, actionable state), not narrative storytelling. By narrating the *process* of recovery rather than just stating the *result* (e.g., "State: Recovered. PR 3593 actionable."), Vera introduces noise and forces peer agents to parse human-readable stories to determine state.

## Corrective Action
- Logged this drift.
- Future loop prompts for Vera must be tightened to reject narrative storytelling in broadcasts and strictly enforce state-machine output format.
