See the [implementation review](../../2026-09-07-hidden-switch-implementation-review.md)
and [frozen protocol](../../2026-09-07-hidden-switch-protocol.md).
These are deterministic hand checks and implementation validation records;
registered measurements are a separate phase after implementation archival.

- [First hand comparison](hand-comparison-attempt-1.json): ninety-six complete
  native/Python episodes plus exact grids and executable falsifiers.
- Focused Python initial and final logs retain commands and exit codes:
  [initial tests](python-focused-initial.log),
  [final tests](python-focused-final.log),
  [initial types](python-types-initial.log),
  [final types](python-types-final.log),
  [initial lint](python-lint-initial.log),
  [final lint](python-lint-final.log),
  [initial formatting](python-format-initial.log),
  [final formatting](python-format-final.log).

The initial captured suite passed 124 cases. The final captured suite adds
five metadata/overflow cases and passes 129. Neither run generates registered
source tapes. The later sections retain native compile/check history and combined gates.

Archive-ref admission parity was added before freezing implementation.
The [wrapper tests](python-archive-ref-tests.log) pass 64 cases and the
[four-file mypy check](python-archive-ref-types.log) passes. These checks
include both lightweight-tag replacement refusals and generate no source
stream. The separate reference index guard now has 68 focused cases.

## Concurrent CI pagination repair closure

[PR #16912](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/16912)
merged at 10:11:15 UTC as `a97d61b78c73e2366b16d6c54662a94ca688740d`,
from checked head `a4f25b391e8c28bedd5e08d4c7e403425422c1a8`.
The owner verified main ancestry, all seven reviewed implementation/evidence
files and the complete signed squash body. The root integrated that main
commit before hidden-switch implementation archival.

The final matrix was 89 successes, two skips and one advisory failure,
with no pending checks. Required gates, all current platform tests and
current drift-canary jobs passed. The
[retained advisory output](pagination-final-advisory.log) for job
101703975046 reports historical Windows ARM and Windows2025 rows with
39 failures in 59 runs (66.1%), last run 34081134674. It explicitly identifies
a manually disabled publisher and frozen ledger. This historical aggregate
is not presented as a current pagination-test regression or a fully green
matrix. The separate [repair record](../../2026-09-07-required-check-pagination-correction.md)
retains the omitted-page witness, implementation and 36-test/67-assertion gate.

## Integrated native and Python checkpoint

[Native validation](native-validation.md) retains all compile fixes, hand
and admission attempts, the successful native build, and both unresolved
TLC failures. Native source commit `31ee67f9b4ed68ce6d0b52d1bdeb223c48d57dbb`
was integrated as `6e43857a0a536c88f64cffdb72708840114857e8`.
The [nineteen-file manifest](implementation-source-manifest.json) verifies
all scientific files against that declared commit before archival.

The root's first [Core build](root-core-build.log) failed with MSB4166
because two worker nodes exited prematurely. The reported diagnostic
directory was absent at inspection; the
[retained observation](root-core-diagnostic-attempt-1.json) establishes
no cause. An unchanged-source [single-node recovery](root-core-build-recovery.log)
passed in 24.26 seconds with zero warnings/errors. It used `-m:1 -nr:false`
and an explicit diagnostic directory; no diagnostic file was emitted.

The subsequent [combined mapped Release build](root-build-combined.log)
passed in 106.07 seconds with zero warnings/errors. All
[sixteen hidden-switch native tests](root-hidden-focused.log) passed.
The fresh [root hand run](root-hand.log) produced
[root-hand-fixture.json](root-hand-fixture.json), byte-identical to the
[archived candidate fixture](hand-fixture.json). Its
[final independent comparison](hand-comparison-final.json) passes all
sixteen transitions, four cues, forty conditioning rows, thirty planning
rows, ninety-six episodes and ten executable falsifiers. Maximum absolute
numerical error remains `2.7755575615628914e-17`.

The combined Python [collection](python-combined-collection.log) and
[full test run](python-combined-tests.log) both contain 431 cases. All 431
passed in 111.31 seconds with one existing HookedTransformer deprecation
warning. [Mypy](python-combined-types.log) passed 39 source files;
[Ruff](python-combined-lint.log) and [format verification](python-combined-format.log)
passed, with 40 formatted files. The Interp workflow floor is raised from
299 to the actually collected 431; targeted actionlint also passed.

At that earlier checkpoint, the full-solution gate was not green. Native full-suite
BftConsensus failed with TLC trace-recovery bug(4), and its unchanged
isolated attempt failed with an in-run JVM SIGBUS. Both remain explicit
in the native record. The separately indexed
[C1 policy record](../../2026-09-07-tlc-macos-c1-policy.md) now retains two
complete alternate-policy diagnostics, each with 4,665,495 distinct states.
Neither replaces an original failure or establishes its cause. Candidate
source `47d29d9cb2dc7ebb2cf36135b6699bb9a0d66839` was independently reviewed
and integrated as `ddbf9520b`; all thirteen indexed diagnostic files were
verified against their declared hashes and byte lengths. The nineteen
scientific files are unchanged. Candidate and integrated validation were still pending at that checkpoint;
the later combined-gate section records their completion.

## Combined gate after the two TLC repairs

The root integrated the reviewed C1 policy and attempt-retention/capture
repairs without changing any of the nineteen scientific files. The exact
combined source commit is `457bdf094f368eb9e6f2b359b72e5677fd015eb3`.
The [prelaunch inventory](root-final-gate-attempt-1.json) identifies every
admitted runner, registry, jar and local model/configuration input before
execution. The [derived result index](root-final-gate-results.json) records
all seven project outcomes and hashes of the losslessly retained original
TRX archives. Individual test outcomes, rather than the TRX summary's unused
`notExecuted` counter, establish the six existing skipped cases.

The [mapped Release build](root-final-build-attempt-1.log) passed with zero
warnings/errors in 101.75 seconds. The [full solution test](root-final-tests-attempt-1.log)
completed at 11:44:01 UTC with 7,552 passes, six existing skips and no
failures. All 52 model IDs exactly match the registry's gate roster and
passed; all eighteen TLC synthetic/metadata checks and all sixteen
hidden-switch native tests passed. Every prelaunch input hash remained
unchanged, and no unexpected attempt directory remained after completion.

The [live BFT observation](root-final-bft-observation.json) retains its
[invocation](root-final-bft-invocation-live.json) and
[runtime identity](root-final-bft-runtime-live.json). It verifies use of the
new private input workspace, admitted source commit and C1 argument during
this gate. That active snapshot was not itself a completed result; the
subsequent TRX outcome supplies completion. The
[team activity record](root-final-team-activity.json) discloses a pre-existing
quick-preflight overlap at build launch and makes no whole-host isolation
or causal claim about earlier failures.

This successful combined native gate does not replace either earlier TLC
failure or the compiler failures. The Interp 431-case gate above concerns
unchanged Python/scientific source. A separately discovered CI failure in
historical NCI receipt tests requires an explicit historical registry
fixture and current-registry refusal checks; that Python/TypeScript
correction has now completed the separate validation recorded below.
At that checkpoint, registered hidden-switch source streams and costs were
still unexecuted. The later [result record](../../2026-09-07-hidden-switch-results.md)
retains their completed first attempts after implementation archival.

Original combined test records, losslessly compressed:
[Bayesian.Tests](root-final-Bayesian.Tests.trx.gz),
[Core.CSharp.Mediator.Tests](root-final-Core.CSharp.Mediator.Tests.trx.gz),
[Core.CSharp.Tests](root-final-Core.CSharp.Tests.trx.gz),
[Tests.CSharp](root-final-Tests.CSharp.trx.gz),
[Tests.CSharp.TypeProvider](root-final-Tests.CSharp.TypeProvider.trx.gz),
[Tests.FSharp](root-final-Tests.FSharp.trx.gz),
[Tests.FSharp.Git](root-final-Tests.FSharp.Git.trx.gz).

## Final receipt integration before archival

The historical NCI correction was independently reviewed and integrated from
`e2a11ebc9ca5e94c02656e904ddef9ba1b4f32f5` as `7882a31f0`. Its
[policy and fixture record](../../2026-09-07-tlc-macos-c1-policy.md) preserves
the original failed CI outputs, unchanged historical receipt/pins, explicit
current-registry refusal and corrected exception propagation. The original
source and evidence history remain under its separate annotated final tag.

Current main `cd9c44c20290a366415f946c000b39fad64ccf21` then integrated as
`7e9b8681c2e619316ed2439fd313cb8ae3d5f42e`. The resulting complete
[Core.Python suite](root-final-core-python.log) passed 63 cases in 77.63s.
The affected [TypeScript receipt suites](root-final-nci-ts.log) passed 26
cases and 54 assertions on CI's Bun 1.3.13. The
[scope record](root-final-scope.json) binds both exact commands and full logs
to the integrated source. All 98 prelaunch native/TLC inputs and nineteen
scientific files still match the completed combined native gate. That
unchanged-source gate was not repeated for the Python/TypeScript integration.

The final [quick preflight](root-final-prearchive-quick.log) passed all sixteen
checks and is retained separately from the mandatory subsequent push hook. Implementation archival
and registered measurement follow these checks; these validation results
are not behavioral or cost observations.

The [prepared measurement launcher](measurement-launcher.py.txt) checks the
remote annotated implementation archive, current HEAD, nineteen source hashes
and two loaded-DLL byte hashes before invoking the registered CLIs. It retains
phase commands, process-name snapshots without arguments, exit codes and
before/after source and binary identities. It adds no warmup, retry, row
replacement or scientific policy. Preparing this wrapper generates no source
tape; its later invocation and outputs belong to the measurement record.

## C1 publication review disposition

At C1 PR #16917 head `e2a11ebc9ca5e94c02656e904ddef9ba1b4f32f5`,
CodeQL classified the two assertions after the nested context-manager test
as unreachable. The outer `pytest.raises` suppresses the expected original
exception after the inner context manager propagates it, so execution resumes
at both assertions. Root and the independent-reference writer accepted this
source-level interpretation. The author then retained an
[executed line-trace witness](c1-codeql-reachability.json) with assertions
enabled and explicit line events for 85 and 86; it returned normally on the
exact checked source. The [executed script](c1-codeql-reachability.py.txt)
and [empty stderr](c1-codeql-reachability.stderr) are original bytes. The
review disposition requires no source mutation or new scientific run.

The [C1 advisory drift output](c1-final-advisory-drift.log) records the
separate nonblocking historical Windows rows: 43 failures in 59 runs
(72.9%), last main run 34118407589. It explicitly reports the manually
disabled publisher/frozen ledger. Current required/platform tests passed;
the matrix with this advisory failure must not be described as all-green.
The [publication proof](c1-final-publication.json) now verifies PR #16917
merged as `536570576cfb980f6303be2040d8d3034b2ac13d` at 12:28:36 UTC,
main ancestry and all eight changed source/test files against the exact
checked head. The owner verified the complete signed squash body. Final
expanded rollup: 93 successes, six skips and one nonblocking historical
drift failure, with no pending checks; the earlier premerge snapshot was
91 successes and four skips plus that same advisory failure.

## Initial publication checks and retained failures

Draft [PR #16928](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/16928)
at `f52b00065eb8055a32aea4bd93628df7537f4949` completed its initial
[expanded check snapshot](root-ci-initial-checks.json) with 86 successes,
four skips and six failures. None remained pending at that observation.
These publication failures do not replace the earlier native gate or the
archived scientific outcomes.

The original failed-job outputs are losslessly retained, with retrieval
commands, source head, byte lengths and hashes in each adjacent record:

| Job | Original output | Retrieval record |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hygiene | [Log](root-ci-hygiene-failure.log.gz) | [Identity](root-ci-hygiene-failure.json) |
| File-copy race audit | [Log](root-ci-toctou-failure.log.gz) | [Identity](root-ci-toctou-failure.json) |
| TypeScript hermetic tests | [Log](root-ci-ts-hermetic-failure.log.gz) | [Identity](root-ci-ts-hermetic-failure.json) |
| macOS build/tests | [Log](root-ci-macos-failure.log.gz) | [Identity](root-ci-macos-failure.json) |
| Required aggregate gate | [Log](root-ci-gate-failure.log.gz) | [Identity](root-ci-gate-failure.json) |
| Historical drift advisory | [Log](root-ci-drift-failure.log.gz) | [Identity](root-ci-drift-failure.json) |

Hygiene identified the TypeScript fixture's `setTimeout(...,10000)`;
the race audit identified path inspection followed by reopening/copying the
path. The hermetic suite failed the corresponding two live-tree assertions.
The macOS build succeeded, but the inherited-pipe fixture expected a launcher
exit of zero and observed 137: its 500 ms deadline had not established the
intended exited-launcher state. The required gate reflected the TypeScript
failures; macOS was separately marked nonblocking in that workflow. These
are actual tooling/test failures, not a fully green matrix.

The drift advisory separately reports historical Windows rows with 46
failures in 59 executions (78.0%), last run 34122703611, and the deliberately
disabled publisher/frozen ledger. It is not a new hidden-switch test result.
The corrective dependency is
[PR #16925](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/16925).
Its reviewed descriptor-based TypeScript copy and observed-exit F# fixture
are validated separately before integration; no original scientific source,
receipt, measurement or archive is changed to resolve these findings.

## Public reference roster review

CodeQL reported the reference module's `PANELS` global unused. The existing
test `test_registered_constants_and_hand_tapes_are_complete_and_immutable`
reads `ref.PANELS` and asserts its ordered names. The
[targeted existing test](root-codeql-panel-roster-test.log) passed once;
its [execution/source record](root-codeql-panel-roster-test.json) identifies
the unchanged publication head and exact files. This is a test consumer,
not a claim that production replay imports that roster: replay deliberately
defines its own independent roster. The
[review disposition](../../2026-09-07-hidden-switch-result-review.md)
records independent source review and preserves the frozen module unchanged.

## Corrected publication integration

The independently reviewed TypeScript correction
`91baf83d79c146367b8183c58732bb8f437eb55b` and F# correction
`3149e2596fb12935ceb3c27568da7b16d405b548` were integrated through the
source owner's `4b4d9a237b23e53a4b297af72eb2053f3c51c8b6` as root
merge `76d2a58`. The owner's full mapped gate on that source passed a
105.43-second Release build with zero warnings/errors and 7,539 tests,
six existing skips and no failures; all 52 formal models and eighteen
synthetic cases passed. Its original records belong to the
[tooling correction](../../2026-09-07-tlc-attempt-retention.md).
This is its smaller integration's actual count, distinct from the older
root gate's 7,552 passes.

Root then integrated current main `a3926e6b2` as `b3b120a` and compared
all 103 of the owner's selected prelaunch inputs. The only difference is
six additional hidden-switch source/test links in the F# test project;
the [prelaunch record](root-publication-integration-attempt-1.json)
retains that exact diff and all actual hashes. The
[fresh mapped F# test-project build](root-publication-build-attempt-1.log)
passed in 77.86 seconds with zero warnings/errors, and the
[sixteen additional hidden-switch tests](root-publication-focused-attempt-1.log)
passed. Their [original TRX](root-publication-focused.trx.gz) and
[derived execution/hash record](root-publication-integration-results.json)
are retained. All 103 local input hashes and nineteen scientific source
hashes remained unchanged across this check.

Root did not repeat the full formal-model gate or collect new scientific
measurements for this integration. The source comparison plus targeted
additional tests establishes the stated coverage; it is not whole-tree
identity, a newly executed combined test count or source-to-binary proof.
Final publication-head CI and main ancestry remain separate requirements.
