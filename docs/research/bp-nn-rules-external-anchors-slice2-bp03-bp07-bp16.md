# BP-NN Rules External Anchor Backfill — Slice 2 (BP-03, BP-07, BP-16)

Scope: External prior-art anchors for three multiply-referenced BP-NN rules in
`docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md`. This is slice 2 of the B-0314 backfill; slice 1
covered BP-10 and BP-11 (CI-enforced rules). These three rules were selected by
reference-frequency audit: BP-16 (18 skill references), BP-07 (13), BP-03 (11) —
the highest-referenced rules without anchors after the CI-enforced set.

Rules covered: BP-03 (skill body ≤ ~300 lines; one purpose per skill), BP-07
(notebook hard cap 3000 words; prune every 3rd invocation), BP-16 (P0-critical
invariants verified with ≥ 2 independent formal tools).

## BP-03 — Skill body ≤ ~300 lines; one purpose per skill

**Rule text (from AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md):**
*"Skill body ≤ ~300 lines; one purpose per skill. Rationale: bloat dilutes
triggering and reviewability. Split at the cap; merge only via `skill-creator`."*

**Core claim:** A modular, single-purpose skill design — with bounded size — outperforms
monolithic or bloated designs on both triggering accuracy and reviewability. This is
the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) applied to LLM skill/prompt modules.

- Authors: Yue Shang, Keyu Hua, Shuofei Qiao, et al.
- Venue: International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025
- Relevance: Formalises LLM agent design as decomposing into four independent
  single-purpose modules (Planning, Reasoning, Tool Use, Memory) each with a
  "uniform I/O interface." Demonstrates empirically that modular recombination
  of single-purpose units achieves ≥17% average performance gain over monolithic
  hand-crafted agents on standard benchmarks. Directly validates the one-purpose-
  per-skill and bounded-size design constraints in BP-03.

  practice modular design so you can evolve your agent's capabilities without
  needing to radically redesign your infrastructure," and recommending specialised
  single-purpose sub-agents (e.g., one LLM call per guardrail evaluation) over
  consolidating multiple concerns into a single prompt. Directly maps to BP-03's
  one-purpose-per-skill requirement.
- Key quote: "Each individual component … is relatively simple, using only a
  few tools and a narrow task description."

Acquisition, Security, and the Path Forward" (arXiv 2602.12430, 2026)**

- URL: <https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12430>
- Relevance: Defines the industry-emerging skill-as-module contract: a skill is
  "a composable package of instructions, code, and resources that agents load on
  demand." Notes that progressive context loading "enables LLMs to focus on
  salient information, substantially optimizing both the length and quality of
  context windows" — a direct justification for size caps (unbounded skills
  undermine the optimisation).

### SRP lineage note

The one-purpose-per-skill constraint in BP-03 is an application of Robert C.
Martin's Single Responsibility Principle (Agile Software Development, 2003):
"A class should have one and only one reason to change." Applied to LLM skills:
a skill that mixes triggering concerns, execution logic, and state management has
multiple reasons to change — and multiple failure modes per change.

## BP-07 — Notebook hard cap is 3000 words; prune every 3rd invocation

**Rule text (from AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md):**
*"Notebook hard cap is 3000 words; prune every 3rd invocation. Rationale: the
notebook becomes part of the next invocation's effective prompt. A growing notebook
silently rewrites the skill. Cap + prune keep it auditable."*

**Core claim:** Growing context/memory degrades LLM instruction-following in
empirically measurable ways; bounded memory with periodic pruning is the
practical prevention mechanism. The 3000-word cap maps to the empirically
observed degradation threshold.

- Authors: Nelson F. Liu, Kevin Lin, John Hewitt, et al. (Stanford NLP)
- Venue: ACL Transactions on Computational Linguistics (TACL), 2024
- Relevance: Foundational empirical paper. Across multi-document QA and key-value
  retrieval tasks: "performance is often highest when relevant information occurs
  at the beginning or end of the input context, and significantly degrades when
  models must access relevant information in the middle of long contexts, even for
  explicitly long-context models." This primacy/recency failure mode is the direct
  mechanistic justification for hard caps: unbounded notebooks bury critical
  material in the degraded middle band, silently reducing the skill's effective
  behaviour.

  performance degrades significantly when models must access information in the
  middle of long input contexts."

Performance" (2024)**

- URL: <https://research.trychroma.com/context-rot>
- Authors: Chroma Research
- Date: 2024
- Relevance: Names and quantifies "context rot" — the phenomenon where "model
  performance [degrades] as input length increases, often in surprising and
  non-uniform ways." Finds that lower semantic similarity between target content
  and query accelerates degradation as context grows, and that distractor
  non-uniformity becomes more pronounced at larger input sizes. Directly justifies
  periodic pruning (every 3rd invocation) as a context-rot mitigation: stale
  notebook entries act as distractors that compound degradation.
- Key quote: "Context rot: How increasing input tokens impacts LLM performance."

**3. MLOps Community — "The Impact of Prompt Bloat on LLM Output Quality" (2024)**

- URL: <https://mlops.community/blog/the-impact-of-prompt-bloat-on-llm-output-quality>
- Relevance: Practitioner research identifying "degradation in reasoning
  performance of LLMs at around 3000 tokens, well below the context windows of
  LLMs," and that "instruction following rate degrades as the number of
  instructions increases." Note: the source reports degradation in *tokens*;
  BP-07's cap is expressed in *words* (different units; ~1 word ≈ 1.3 tokens
  on average for English prose, so 3000 words ≈ 3900 tokens). The 3000-word
  cap is calibrated to the same order of magnitude as this threshold, erring
  slightly above the token count — this is a conservative approximation
  grounded in the source's finding of below-context-window onset.

### Mechanism note

The three anchors together explain different layers of the same failure mode:
Liu et al. (2024) identifies *where* in context information is most attended to
(edges not middle); Chroma Research (2024) identifies *what* triggers rot
(length + distractor density); MLOps Community (2024) identifies the *threshold*
(~3000 tokens, approximately 2000–2300 words) at which degradation becomes
measurable. BP-07's 3000-word cap is calibrated to this token-scale threshold
(with an explicit word/token unit difference acknowledged); the prune cadence
addresses all three failure layers.

## BP-16 — Verify P0-critical invariants with ≥ 2 independent formal tools

**Rule text (from AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md):**
*"For P0-critical invariants, verify with ≥ 2 independent formal tools (e.g.
TLA+/TLC + FsCheck + Z3); single-tool P0 evidence is insufficient. Rationale:
each formal tool has a distinct blind spot (TLA+ ignores bit arithmetic; Z3
ignores interleavings; FsCheck samples a finite cone). Agreement across tools
shrinks the residual failure surface to their three-way intersection."*

**Core claim:** No single formal verification tool can exhaustively cover all
failure modes; each has distinct blind spots. Multi-tool agreement is the
standard for P0-critical systems and is required to shrink the residual failure
surface to the intersection of tool coverage gaps.

- Authors: Tomas Kulik, Brijesh Dongol, Peter Gorm Larsen, et al.
- Venue: Formal Aspects of Computing (ACM), 2022
- Relevance: Broad survey splitting formal methods into theorem proving, model
  checking, and lightweight FM; documents that each class has distinct coverage
  properties and blind spots. Model checkers exhaustively enumerate finite state
  spaces but cannot handle infinite state; theorem provers handle richer
  properties but require manual guidance; lightweight FM trades completeness for
  tractability. The conclusion: "complementary tool classes are necessary for
  high-assurance coverage" — directly grounding BP-16's requirement that ≥ 2
  independent tools be used.

### Zeta anchor case

The round-22 `InfoTheoreticSharder` cross-check referenced in BP-16's rationale
is the canonical in-repo worked example: the same P0 property was verified by
both TLA+/TLC (covering concurrent interleaving) and FsCheck (sampling the cone
of finite executions), and the two tools agreed — providing stronger evidence
than either alone. This is BP-16's empirical grounding within the project.
