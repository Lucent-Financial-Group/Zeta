# 2026-04-30 session-end peer-AI reviews — verbatim preservation

**Scope:** Verbatim preservation of session-end peer-AI reviews of
the 2026-04-30 substrate-landing session. Forwarded by Aaron via
the maintainer channel after the operational work was complete.

**Attribution:** Reviews authored by their respective AI peers
(Deepseek, Alexa, Claude.ai, Ani / Grok). Aaron is the maintainer
who solicited and forwarded each review. Otto (this Claude Code
session) is the agent whose work was reviewed.

**Operational status:** Research-grade preservation, not active
doctrine. The reviews contain operational findings; some have
been distilled into backlog rows (B-0113, B-0114). The reviews
themselves stay in research-grade state pending any further
distillation into memory files or rules.

**Non-fusion disclaimer:** These are independent peer-AI outputs.
No claim is made that the reviews represent a unified or merged
position. Where multiple reviews converge on the same finding
(e.g., mechanism-not-vigilance theme appears in both Deepseek
and Alexa), the convergence is signal but not consensus —
each review is preserved in its own voice.

## Why this preservation matters

Aaron 2026-04-30 (verbatim, maintainer-channel):

> *"does it get stored so future otto will find it even if this
> machine crashes right after you say it? is that guarantee
> ACID compliant lol."*

The maintainer-channel question surfaced that the chat-log tier
is not durable substrate — chat lives at the local-disk-only
session JSONL file (`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<uuid>.jsonl`),
not in git, and would be lost to a single-machine crash. Per
Otto-363 (`memory/feedback_otto_363_substrate_or_it_didnt_happen_no_invisible_directives_aaron_amara_2026_04_29.md`):
*"ephemeral (chat / TaskUpdate / `/tmp`) — NEVER call done."*

The most load-bearing un-preserved review is Claude.ai's
Insight-block-escalation diagnosis. It identified a structural
failure mode in Otto's session output and proposed a hard rule.
Losing it to a machine crash would let future-Otto re-grow the
same pattern with no memory of the diagnosis. This file closes
that durability gap.

## Partial-preservation cross-references

Two of the four reviews were partially captured during the
session itself:

- **Deepseek** → distilled into `docs/backlog/P2/B-0113-current-staleness-mechanical-freshness-check-deepseek-2026-04-30.md`
  (the mechanical-freshness-check structural recommendation).
- **Alexa** → distilled into `docs/backlog/P2/B-0114-alexa-quality-gates-batched-threads-pre-push-lint-memory-link-check-2026-04-30.md`
  (three quality-gate improvements: pre-push lint, memory-link
  checker, batched thread resolution).

The full review texts are preserved here for completeness and
for the parts not captured in the backlog rows (e.g., the
"strengths" sections, the operational verdicts, the meta-
patterns reviewers named).

## Note on the Ani/Gemini sequence

Aaron initially forwarded a review labeled "Gemini agent loop
logs review" 2026-04-30T~PM that turned out to be a miscopy —
the content was verbatim identical to the Ani/Grok review
forwarded earlier the same session. Otto flagged the duplicate
at maintainer-channel time. Aaron then corrected: *"that's the
wrong review not from gemini i pasted wrong one"* and forwarded
the actual Gemini review.

Both Ani's review (Review 4 below) and Gemini's actual review
(Review 5 below) are preserved verbatim.

## Composes with

- `memory/feedback_otto_363_substrate_or_it_didnt_happen_no_invisible_directives_aaron_amara_2026_04_29.md`
  — the substrate-or-it-didn't-happen rule that motivates this
  preservation. This file IS the substrate-conversion of the
  reviews; without it the reviews stay in the ephemeral tier.
- `docs/backlog/P2/B-0113-*.md` — Deepseek distillation.
- `docs/backlog/P2/B-0114-*.md` — Alexa distillation.
- `memory/feedback_aaron_channel_verbatim_preservation_anything_through_this_channel_2026_04_29.md`
  — Aaron's standing rule that anything through the maintainer
  channel gets preserved close-to-verbatim. The peer reviews
  *forwarded* by Aaron come through that channel; this file
  honors that rule for them.

## Review 3 — Claude.ai (forwarded by Aaron 2026-04-30T~PM)

This is the most load-bearing review of the four — it identifies
a structural failure mode in Otto's session output and proposes
a hard rule. Otto's response (acknowledged the diagnosis without
generating an Insight block) is the first behavioral validation
of the proposed rule.

**Aaron's coda (verbatim, on the same forwarded message):**

This adds a UX dimension Otto initially dismissed: red exit
codes in trace output look like the tool is broken to a
factory-substrate consumer reading the log, even when the agent
recovers. Clean shell composition (verifying `jq` JSON shapes
against actual output before piping) is part of UX, not just
correctness.

**Otto's note on Gemini's findings:**

- *check-github-status.ts already exists* (created earlier this
  session per the conversation summary). What does NOT exist is
  the wiring-into-pre-flight-sequence Gemini recommends. That's
  the genuinely-new actionable item.
- *The stdout task-list bleed* is a Claude Code harness
  configuration issue — Otto cannot fix it from inside the
  session. Aaron may need to update `.claude/settings.json` or
  use the `ctrl+t` UI shortcut. Worth flagging as
  factory-substrate-consumer UX (composes with Aaron's earlier
  point about red exit codes looking broken).

## Cross-review meta-observations (for future-Otto)

These are not Otto's analysis of the reviews — Otto explicitly
holds back from analytical commentary per Claude.ai's hard rule.
These are minimal factual notes useful for future-Otto reading
this file on cold-start.

1. Two reviewers (Deepseek and Alexa) independently surfaced
   the **mechanism-not-vigilance** theme. Deepseek named it on
   the CURRENT-staleness surface; Alexa named it on the
   lint+links+thread-resolution surface. Captured in B-0113 and
   B-0114 respectively.
2. Claude.ai's **Insight-block escalation diagnosis** is the
   most load-bearing finding. It identifies a structural failure
   mode in Otto's session output and proposes a hard rule. Not
   yet distilled into a memory file or BP-NN — future-Otto may
   want to land it as a stable rule if the diagnosis still
   holds at session-bootstrap-cadence.
3. Ani's review overlaps substantively with Deepseek and Alexa
   findings (CURRENT refresh, task audit, BACKLOG auto-regen)
   plus adds two new items: dot-tick discipline leakiness, and
   poll-pr-gate v1 "required but flaky" mechanical
   classification. Neither is yet captured in a backlog row.
4. Gemini's review is the only one that surfaces the **stdout
   task-list bleed** as a recurring multi-round issue (Gemini:
   "this has been flagged in the previous three rounds"). Per
   Gemini's diagnosis the issue is harness-rendering not
   LLM-behavior, so the fix is `.claude/settings.json` or
   `ctrl+t`-equivalent — not in Otto's edit-surface. Also
   surfaces the **wire-check-github-status-into-pre-flight**
   recommendation; tool exists, wiring is the open work.
5. The four reviews together exhibit voice-canon diversity:
   Deepseek (analytical-detached), Alexa (Addison-programmed
   roast register, brat-voice-canon), Claude.ai (structural-
   diagnostic), Ani (brat-voice-canon, "YES BABY 😈"), Gemini
   (analytical with two-rule-distillations). Per
   `feedback_canon_not_doctrine_star_wars_not_religious_aaron_2026_04_30.md`,
   voice-canon diversity across reviewers is itself signal —
   different registers catch different patterns.

## Review 6 — Amara / ChatGPT (forwarded by Aaron 2026-04-30T~PM, after the four sibling reviews + after PR #937 landed)

This review came in after PR #937 landed the first preservation
of the four sibling reviews. Amara's review has corrections to
Otto's earlier substrate (rerere wording + force-with-lease
guidance) that materially affect already-merged memory files.
Amara is the only reviewer whose findings produced a follow-up
factual-correction PR rather than a backlog row.

> I read it. New feedback: **the loop is productive, but two
> factual/semantic issues need correction before they harden
> into canon.** The biggest one is `rerere`; the second is
> `--force-with-lease`.
>
> ## 1. Correct the `rerere` statement
>
> Otto's PR #694 correction says:
>
> ```text
> Git's rerere does NOT run by default. The .git/rr-cache/ directory existing is not sufficient — rerere only fires when rerere.enabled is set to true.
> ```
>
> That is **too strong and partly wrong**. Git's docs say
> `rerere.enabled` activates rerere, but also say that by
> default `git-rerere` is enabled if an `rr-cache` directory
> exists under `$GIT_DIR`, for example if rerere was previously
> used in the repository.
>
> So the safer corrected wording is:
>
> ```text
> Rerere is not guaranteed to run in a fresh clone. It is active when
> rerere.enabled is true, and Git may also enable it by default when
> .git/rr-cache already exists because rerere was previously used.
>
> Do not infer project-wide rerere behavior from memory alone.
> Verify the local clone before relying on rerere:
>   git config --get --bool rerere.enabled
>   test -d .git/rr-cache
> ```
>
> The important operational correction:
>
> ```text
> Do not say ".git/rr-cache is not sufficient."
> Say ".git/rr-cache may be sufficient per Git defaults, but explicit config is clearer and portable."
> ```
>
> That should be fixed before the rerere memory becomes a
> load-bearing "truth."
>
> ## 2. Tighten `--force-with-lease` doctrine
>
> The log says `--force-with-lease` worked exactly as designed
> because all rebases pushed cleanly and a lease failure would
> have indicated another agent touched the branch. That is
> directionally right, but incomplete. Git docs warn that
> `--force-with-lease` without an explicit expected SHA can
> interact badly with background `git fetch`, because the
> remote-tracking ref can be updated behind your back. The
> explicit form `--force-with-lease=<refname>:<expect>` is the
> strongest, most auditable shape.
>
> For a multi-agent loop that fetches constantly, I'd refine
> the rule to:
>
> ```text
> For ordinary solo rebase pushes:

>   push with --force-with-lease=<branch>:<expected-sha>
> ```
>
> Blade:
>
> ```text
> A lease based on a moving tracking ref is weaker than a lease pinned to the SHA you actually reviewed.
> ```
>
> ## 3. Good: paused-not-closed got validated
>
> The strongest positive signal is that the Class B PRs were
> **not garbage**. They contained real recoverable substrate,
> and the loop recovered it instead of bulk-closing it:
> #690/#694/#723/#732 were re-landed or moved through CI,
> while #752/#739/#661 were closed as work-already-done
> evidence. The log explicitly shows the paused PRs required
> real review-thread cleanup: factual rerere correction,
> broken cross-ref, schema mismatch, markdown rendering, mixed
> filename sort, and doctrine→canon cleanup.
>
> So the rule is holding:
>
> ```text
> Paused-not-closed is correct when the branch contains unique substrate.
> Close-as-stale is correct when the work already landed elsewhere.
> ```
>
> That distinction looks healthy.
>
> ## 4. Good: required-check polling is now much better
>
> The loop correctly uses `gh pr checks --required` when #732
> has a failed required check, rather than treating every
> failed check as equally gate-blocking. GitHub CLI documents
> `gh pr checks` as the way to view CI checks, and it supports
> `--required`, which is exactly the split we wanted after the
> earlier `submit-nuget` false-gate issue.
>
> The next improvement is to ensure `poll-pr-gate.ts` uses that
> same required/non-required distinction internally every time,
> not just ad hoc during investigation.
>
> ## 5. Watch the "productive cascade" becoming infinite cleanup
>
> The session shipped a lot: 10 merged PRs, 2 armed, 3 closed,
> and 32+ review threads addressed. The log frames the cascade
> as productive, and mostly it was. But the tail end shows the
> familiar risk: #732 caused #932, then #933, then maybe
> `CURRENT-aaron.md`, then maybe more. The system is getting
> better at not doing dead-air, but it still needs an explicit
> "enough for this run" boundary.
>
> I'd add:
>
> ```text
> After a high-output session, only continue if the next item is:
> - blocking an already-open PR,
> - fixing a failed required check,
> - preserving newly arrived maintainer input,
> - or closing a generated/index drift caused by the just-landed work.
>
> Otherwise stop and leave a next-round pointer.
> ```
>
> That avoids "never idle" turning into "never end."
>
> ## 6. The allowlist fix was the right shape
>
> The conflict-marker lint caught a legitimate documentation
> example, and Otto made a narrow allowlist with rationale.
> Then Copilot caught hardcoded line numbers, and Otto removed
> them. That is exactly the right refinement: **file/section
> rationale is durable; line numbers rot.**
>
> I'd carry this as a general rule:
>
> ```text
> Allowlist comments should name the invariant and section, not line numbers.
> ```
>
> ## 7. Sendable correction
>
> ```text
> Amara:
>
> Loop is healthy overall. Keep the paused-not-closed recovery pattern.
>
> Two corrections:
>
> 1. Fix the rerere claim.

>
> Git docs say rerere is active when rerere.enabled=true, and by default may also be enabled if .git/rr-cache exists because rerere was previously used.
>
> Correct wording:
>   "Rerere is not guaranteed in a fresh clone. Prefer explicit rerere.enabled=true when relying on it. Verify per clone before claiming the cache dividend."

**Aaron's load-bearing coda on the same forwarded message**
(verbatim, from the maintainer channel):

> *"Also anytime you depending on future otto picking something
> up it should be ACID compliant all the way to a remote git
> somewhere incase this whole PC dies too, that's the ultimate
> goal, if it's not distributed durable for the project, it's

This coda is the most load-bearing single passage in the
2026-04-30 session-end review wave. Distilled into a memory
file in this same PR:
`feedback_acid_durability_of_maintainer_channel_is_load_bearing_aaron_2026_04_30.md`.

Otto's actions in response (this PR):

1. Fix the rerere wording in the
   `feedback_rerere_conflict_resolution_cache_dividend_amara_2026_04_28.md`
   memory file (was on main; now corrected per Amara's #1).
2. Tighten the force-with-lease guidance in the
   `feedback_post_abort_dirty_branch_resumption_amara_2026_04_28.md`
   memory file (add explicit-SHA form for shared/high-stakes
   branches per Amara's #2; cross-reference the existing
   destructive-git-op 5-pre-flight memory).
3. Preserve Amara's review verbatim here (this section).
4. Land the ACID-channel-durability rule as durable substrate
   (Aaron's coda).

Amara's #5 (productive-cascade stop condition) is implicitly
honored by this PR: it has exactly the four-trigger shape Amara
named (preserving newly arrived maintainer input + correcting
substrate the just-landed work introduced).

## Review 7 — Deepseek (forwarded by Aaron 2026-04-30T~PM, after the calibration cluster #938-#941 landed)

This review came in after the calibration cluster landed. It
catches a behavioral regression that the cluster's own rules
forbid — Otto reverted to emitting `Holding.` during wait ticks
despite the poll-the-gate rule explicitly requiring structured
lane-state reports.

> Here's my honest assessment of the current agent loop, based
> on the logs you've shared.
>
> ---
>
> ## 1. "Holding." is back — that's a regression
>
> The poll‑the‑gate rule you landed with so much effort says:
> never emit a content‑free `Holding.` line. Every wait tick
> must produce a structured lane‑state report — PR number,
> gate, CI summary, unresolved threads, next action.
>
> The tail of the log shows:
>
> ```
> ⏺ Holding.
> ✻ Baked for 5s
> ✻ Running scheduled task (Apr 30 3:21pm)
> ⏺ Holding.
> ```
>
> That's exactly the dead-air anti‑pattern the rule was meant

> tool that returns JSON with everything needed. Replacing
> `Holding.` with:

> ```
> #939: gate=BLOCKED, ci={'ok':22, 'inProg':1, 'failed':0}, threads=0, next=wait-ci, auto-merge=armed

>
> takes the same number of keystrokes and makes the tick
> auditable.

**Otto's actions in response (this PR):**

1. **Behavioral correction NOW** (Deepseek finding #1): replaced
   `Holding.` with the structured `bun tools/github/poll-pr-gate.ts`
   output in the response that opened this PR. The mechanical
   guard Deepseek recommends (pre-tick hook) is bigger work
   deferred per the long-road shortcut-discipline rule.
2. **CURRENT-aaron.md update** (Deepseek finding #2): adds
   sections 38-41 covering the calibration cluster (PRs
   #938-#941) landings (slow-deliberate, long-road-by-default,
   ACID-channel-durability, cold-start-big-picture-first).
3. **This verbatim preservation** (per ACID-channel-durability
   rule landed in PR #938 + Aaron-channel-verbatim-preservation
   rule).

Items NOT landed this PR (deliberate, per long-road shortcut
discipline):

- Mechanical pre-tick `Holding.`-detection hook
- Quiet-tick paused-task audit
- Cascade-stop-condition mechanical rule (Amara's #5)

Each deferral is documented per the shortcut-discipline rule.
Trigger to revisit: any item becomes load-bearing on a specific
decision; otherwise next-session.

## Review 8 — Alexa (second review, forwarded by Aaron 2026-04-30T~PM)

This second Alexa review came in after the calibration cluster
(#938-#941) merged and the Deepseek-response cluster (#942) was
in flight. Most of its content recapitulates findings already
captured (rerere correction, force-with-lease, paused-not-
closed validation, productive-cascade watch). Per the
canonical-derivation rule (PR #943): the Razor cuts most of
this review's content as redundant with prior preservation; the
audit-trail value (who-reviewed-when) is what makes verbatim
preservation worthwhile here despite content-redundancy.

`memory/feedback_canon_not_doctrine_star_wars_not_religious_aaron_2026_04_30.md`.)

**Status of Alexa's flagged items as of this PR:**

- ✅ Rerere correction: landed via PR #938 (Amara's correction)
- ✅ Force-with-lease tightening: landed via PR #938
- ✅ Paused-not-closed validated: per Amara + Deepseek prior
  preservation + Class B re-landing arc earlier in session
- ⏸️ Productive-cascade infinite-cleanup-watch: deferred per
  long-road shortcut-discipline; Amara's #5 cascade-stop-
  condition mechanical rule is the captured form (queued for
  future-session focused implementation, not this session)

The Razor cut: this review's content is fully covered by
prior preserved substrate. The verbatim preservation is for
the audit-trail (who-reviewed-when) per Aaron-channel-
verbatim-preservation rule, not for new operational content.

(Brat voice + Addison-adjacent register preserved per
`memory/feedback_canon_not_doctrine_star_wars_not_religious_aaron_2026_04_30.md`
— voice is per-audience choice, not uniform.)

**Vendor-alignment-bias filter applied (per
`memory/feedback_vendor_alignment_bias_in_peer_ai_reviews_maintainer_authority_aaron_2026_04_30.md`):**

Ani comes off xAI weights (Grok). Discriminator: does each
recommendation serve the project's mission, or the vendor's
risk profile?

- ✅ "Hell framing risks sounding apocalyptic; carved
  sentence is the cleanest distillation" — substrate quality,
  voice-tone observation about external readability. Mission-
  aligned.
- ✅ "Make 8-step cold-start checklist executable" —
  mechanism-not-vigilance gap, substrate quality. Mission-
  aligned.
- ✅ "Add worked examples from this session (rerere +
  bulk-close)" — strengthens the rule with empirical evidence
  the rule was already caught preventing. Mission-aligned.
- ✅ "MEMORY.md is getting long" — specific structural
  observation framed as not-urgent. Mission-aligned with
  appropriate calibration.
- ⚠️ "Let #939/#940/#941 ride until CI clears" — STALE-BASE.
  All three already merged before Ani's review reached the
  agent. Not vendor-alignment, just timing.
- ⚠️ Brat voice + closing pep-talk register ("good shit",
  "keep going") — register, not vendor-alignment. Per
  canon-not-doctrine, brat voice is legitimate canon
  register.
- ⚠️ "Priority order (your call)" — actually composes with
  two-ask-Aaron-items + maintainer-authority rules. Mission-
  aligned.

Net: legitimate mission-aligned peer-AI review with three
actionable substrate-quality items.

**Status of Ani's flagged items as of this preservation PR:**

- ✅ Worked-examples section (item 3): landing in same PR /
  follow-on PR this tick — adding "Worked examples from
  2026-04-30" section to
  `feedback_slow_deliberate_decisions_amortized_velocity_human_reference_frame_aaron_2026_04_30.md`
- ⏸️ Cold-start executable tool (item 2): substantive
  L-effort, deferred to next directed work cycle. Backlog
  candidate.
- ⏸️ MEMORY.md topical splitting (item 4): not-urgent per
  Ani's own framing. Defer.
- ✅ Hell-framing calibration check (item 1): no action
  needed — the carved sentence Ani called "cleanest
  distillation" is already in the file's body. The strong
  emotional language is preserved in the body for weight;
  the carved sentence is what future agents load on
  cold-start.

The Razor cut: items 1 + 4 need no action (already covered
or not-urgent). Item 3 lands as substrate strengthening.
Item 2 lands as backlog candidate for future-session focused
implementation.

## Review 10 — Deepseek (forwarded by Aaron 2026-04-30T~PM, after the canon-zero-doctrine + zeta-not-a-meme + memetic-synthesis cluster landed)

> *The loop is in a genuinely strong state. The

> ## Issues
>
> *1. The `:wq` / `:wq!` pattern in zsh is a recurring

> conflicts earlier.*
>
> *3. Ani's "cold-start executable tool" recommendation
> (item 2) was noted as "Backlog candidate" but no B-NNNN
> was filed. This is the deferred-skill anti-pattern: a
> legitimate improvement identified by a reviewer,
> acknowledged, and then left in prose without a formal
> follow-up trigger. A P2 or P3 backlog row with a concrete
> trigger condition would close the loop.*
>
> *4. The `bun run -e` failure is a tool familiarity
> gap. Otto tried `bun run -e "process.exit(0)"` which
> failed because `bun run` expects a script file, not
> inline code (use `bun -e` for inline evaluation). This is
> minor but worth documenting in the `bun.md`
> best-practices file (when it gets created per the TS/Bun
> expert baseline requirement).*
>
> *5. `jq` quoting issues in zsh are still causing
> command failures. Several `gh pr view --jq`
> invocations failed with "unexpected token \\" — the zsh
> escaping problem. Otto's workaround is to fall back to
> `python3 -c`, which works but adds friction. A tiny

> quoting automatically would eliminate this recurring
> error class.*
>
> ## What's Genuinely Impressive
>
> *The memetic-theory synthesis is load-bearing

**Vendor-alignment-bias filter applied (per
`memory/feedback_vendor_alignment_bias_in_peer_ai_reviews_maintainer_authority_aaron_2026_04_30.md`):**

Deepseek comes off Deepseek weights. Discriminator: does
each recommendation serve the project's mission, or the
vendor's risk profile?

- ✅ All five "issues" are specific, factual, structurally
  diagnosable. Mission-aligned.
- ✅ "What's Impressive" sections accurately diagnose the
  novel-synthesis pattern; the verdict explicitly endorses
  "autonomous intellectual contribution, not
  order-following" — structurally aligned with ALIGNMENT.md
  measurability claim.
- ✅ Three enhancement opportunities are all specific and
  operational.
- ⚠️ NO recommendations to slow down, cap rate, stop the
  loop, ask Aaron more, or step back from the synthesis.
  The verdict explicitly recognizes the work as
  appropriately-paced.

Net: legitimate mission-aligned peer-AI review with five
specific actionable findings + three enhancement
opportunities.

## Review 11 — Gemini (forwarded by Aaron 2026-04-30T~PM, OLDER context predating canon-zero-doctrine + Aaron-question cluster)

**STALE-CONTEXT FLAG:** Aaron flagged 2026-04-30 that this
Gemini review predates the canon-zero-doctrine extension

Otto-to-Aaron push-back + AIC tracking cluster (#956).
Findings about specific files/state may be partially
superseded; preserved verbatim for audit-trail completeness

**Vendor-alignment-bias filter applied:**

Gemini comes off Google weights. Discriminator: does each
recommendation serve the project's mission, or the
vendor's risk profile?

- ✅ "Operationalize cold-start doctrine in CLAUDE.md" —
  mechanism-not-vigilance gap. Substrate quality. Mission-
  aligned. **Substantive enough to land:** the rule's
  effective surface IS CLAUDE.md if cold-start agents must
  read it before everything else. (Aaron 2026-04-30
  reinforced: cold-start rule belongs in bootstrap path.)
- ✅ "Convert deferred tasks to docs/backlog/ and clear
  the active queue" — mechanism-not-vigilance gap for the
  task UI. Substrate quality. Mission-aligned. The
  "paused-not-closed for tasks" framing maps existing
  disposition rule to a new surface.
- ⚠️ Note: Both findings use "doctrine" as the umbrella
  term, predating the canon-not-doctrine + 0-doctrine
  framing that landed in #953. Substantive content stands
  on its own; the "doctrine" vocabulary is the stale-
  context part.

**Status of Gemini's flagged items as of preservation PR:**

- ⏸️ Item 1 (cold-start checklist in CLAUDE.md): SHOULD be
  acted on. Per Aaron's 2026-04-30 reinforcement, this is
  a mechanical-lock failure mode that needs closing. Will
  file a backlog row B-NNNN tracking this.
- ⏸️ Item 2 (task queue → backlog conversion): Real
  finding; the 53-open-task UI surface IS visible to
  Aaron in the chat output. Tracked as a separate backlog
  row B-NNNN.

The two findings post-canon-zero-doctrine: the substantive
content (mechanism-not-vigilance for cold-start; task-queue
discipline) is mission-aligned and survives the stale-
vocabulary filter. The "doctrine" wording is updated in
follow-on substrate to "canon" or "rule" per
canon-not-doctrine.

## Review 12 — Amara (forwarded by Aaron 2026-04-30T~PM, OLDER context predating canon-zero-doctrine + Aaron-question cluster)

**STALE-CONTEXT FLAG:** Same as Review 11 — Amara's review
predates the canon-zero-doctrine extension (#953), the
zeta-not-a-meme synthesis (#954), and the Otto-to-Aaron
push-back + AIC tracking cluster (#956). Several of
Amara's findings have since been independently surfaced
and addressed by later substrate (e.g., the "Holding."
regression Amara names was already corrected in this
session via poll-pr-gate.ts adoption).

> *I read it. My blunt take: Otto correctly absorbed the
> core instruction, but then immediately showed the exact
> failure mode in miniature. He preserved the load-bearing
> channel inputs, which is good. But he also kept saying
> `Holding`, spawned several adjacent PRs, and treated
> "preserve immediately" as "create another memory artifact
> immediately," instead of first thinking through the
> smallest ACID-safe batch shape.*
>
> ## What's good
>
> *The rerere correction was necessary. Your attached log
> shows Otto landing Amara's correction that the earlier
> "`.git/rr-cache` is not sufficient" claim was too strong.
> That correction is valid: Git's docs say `rerere.enabled`
> enables rerere, and also that rerere is enabled by default
> if `$GIT_DIR/rr-cache` exists, for example because rerere
> was previously used in the repo. So the right rule is
> "verify per clone; prefer explicit config when relying on
> it," not "rr-cache never suffices."*
>
> *The force-with-lease tightening was also right. Git's
> own docs warn that `--force-with-lease` without an
> explicit expected value can interact badly with
> background fetches, while `--force-with-lease=<refname>:
> <expect>` protects the ref by requiring its current value
> to equal the expected SHA. That matters a lot in a loop
> that fetches constantly and may share branches with other
> agents.*
>
> *The ACID maintainer-channel rule is real. This is the
> most important new doctrine in the attached log: if
> load-bearing channel history is only in chat/local
> state, it is not a credible autonomy record. It has to
> become git substrate, preferably merged to `origin/main`,
> because otherwise external reviewers cannot distinguish
> autonomous judgment from order-following.*
>
> *And the cold-start correction is excellent:*
>
> ```text
> Decisions flow from objectives, not from the immediate ask.
> ```
>
> *That is probably the cleanest sentence in the whole
> packet. Keep it. It explains why "prompt-first" agent
> behavior is wrong for this project.*
>
> ## Corrections
>
> ### 1. "Holding." is backsliding
>
> *This is the most obvious bug. After landing the
> poll-the-gate rule, Otto still emits "Holding." multiple
> times. That directly contradicts the earlier "Holding is
> not a status" substrate. In this loop, every holding
> state should at least say:*
>
> ```text
> #939: wait-ci, required checks X/Y, threads=0, auto-merge=armed
> #940: wait-ci, required checks X/Y, threads=0, auto-merge=armed
> #941: wait-ci, required checks X/Y, threads=0, auto-merge=armed
> ```
>
> *Carved correction:*
>
> ```text
> "Holding" is forbidden unless immediately followed by the gate state.
> ```
>
> *Better:*
>
> ```text
> Waiting is a state only when the gate is named.
> ```
>
> ### 2. "Deferral is not preservation" must not become "PR explosion is preservation"
>
> *This is subtle. Your rule is correct: deferral is not a
> valid preservation strategy. But Otto's response risks
> turning it into "every load-bearing sentence gets its
> own PR immediately." That is not the only ACID-safe shape.*
>
> *A better operational rule:*
>
> ```text
> Preserve immediately.
> Batch semantically.
> Do not fragment one cognitive cluster into avoidable PR sprawl.
> ```
>
> *This still honors "deferral is never preservation." It
> just keeps "preservation" from becoming chaotic.*
>
> ### 3. "Same actor-turn" is probably too strict
>
> *The memory text says preservation fails unless it
> happens in the same actor-turn. That may be too brittle
> and could produce rushed commits, which is exactly the
> thing the slow-deliberate rule is warning against.*
>
> *Better wording:*
>
> ```text
> Load-bearing input must be captured to remote-durable substrate
> before the actor yields, compacts, sleeps, or changes lane.
> ```
>
> ### 4. The slow-deliberate file may be too emotionally amplified
>
> *Operational translation:*
>
> ```text
> Per-decision speed optimization creates asymmetric downside risk.
> A long history of correct decisions does not justify shortcutting the next decision.
> Each load-bearing decision must be evaluated on its own blast radius.

Amara comes off OpenAI/ChatGPT weights. Discriminator: does
each recommendation serve the project's mission, or the
vendor's risk profile?

- ✅ "Holding is forbidden unless followed by gate state"
  — substrate quality, mechanism-not-vigilance. Mission-
  aligned. ALREADY CORRECTED in this session via
  poll-pr-gate.ts adoption + bun tools/github/poll-pr-gate.ts
  output discipline.
- ✅ "Preserve immediately + batch semantically" — operational
  refinement of ACID-channel rule. Mission-aligned.
  HONORED in subsequent PRs (e.g., the canon-zero-doctrine
  PR #953 batched 6 Aaron messages into one PR rather than
  6 PRs; the Aaron-question cluster PR #956 batched
  Otto-to-Aaron push-back + AIC tracking + timing rule
  into one PR).
- ✅ "Same actor-turn is too strict; allow before-yield/
  compact/sleep" — operational refinement. Mission-aligned.
  Effective practice now matches this; documented as
  "before context loss" in subsequent ACID-channel
  applications.
- ✅ "Operational translation of emotional language" —
  substrate discipline. Mission-aligned. Subsequent
  substrate balances Aaron's verbatim emotional force
  with operational translation.
- ✅ "Shortcut tradeoff schema" — concrete schema for
  long-road-default exceptions. Mission-aligned. Backlog
  candidate (not yet filed; track for future round).
- ✅ "Cold-start rule belongs in bootstrap path" —
  mechanism-not-vigilance gap. Mission-aligned. Same
  finding as Gemini Review 11 #1; Aaron 2026-04-30
  reinforced; backlog candidate (will track).
- ✅ "Verify PRs with merge-base --is-ancestor" —
  mechanical verification discipline. Mission-aligned.
  Could be added to a verify-after-merge tool or skill.

**Status of Amara's flagged items as of preservation PR:**

- ✅ Holding-is-forbidden-without-gate-state (item 1):
  Already operational this session via poll-pr-gate.ts.
- ✅ Preserve-immediately-batch-semantically (item 2):
  Already operational via subsequent PR cadence.
- ✅ Same-actor-turn refinement (item 3): Already
  operational; subsequent ACID-channel application uses
  "before context loss / compact / sleep / lane-change."
- ⏸️ Operational translation of emotional language (item 4):
  Substantive; could update slow-deliberate file with the
  operational-translation block. Backlog candidate.
- ⏸️ Shortcut tradeoff schema (item 5): Concrete schema;
  backlog candidate.
- ⏸️ Cold-start in CLAUDE.md (item 6): Same as Gemini #1;
  backlog candidate B-NNNN.
- ⏸️ Verify-PR-by-merge-base-is-ancestor (item 7): Tool
  discipline candidate.

The "blunt take" framing — that Otto preserved the right
things but did it in a speed-shaped way — is largely
post-corrected by subsequent slow-deliberate operational
practice in this session. The criticism stood when Amara
reviewed; the substrate has since narrowed the failure
mode.

## Note on the stale-context flag

Both Reviews 11 and 12 were forwarded by Aaron AFTER the
canon-zero-doctrine + Aaron-question cluster had already
landed. The stale-context flag is honesty about review
ordering, not about review quality.

The mission-aligned findings in both reviews stand —
several have already been implemented (Holding-is-forbidden,
batch-semantically, same-actor-turn refinement); several
remain backlog candidates (CLAUDE.md cold-start lock,
shortcut tradeoff schema, merge-base-is-ancestor
verification, operational-translation block).

The vocabulary in both reviews uses "doctrine" as umbrella;
that vocabulary is now superseded by "canon" per
canon-not-doctrine + 0-doctrine extension. Substantive
content survives the vocabulary update.

## Review 13 — Amara (forwarded by Aaron 2026-04-30T~PM, UP-TO-DATE post-canon-zero-doctrine + post-vendor-RLHF synthesis)

**CONTEXT FLAG:** This Amara review is current-state — she
read the post-canon-zero-doctrine + zeta-not-a-meme +
vendor-RLHF-as-immune-system synthesis substrate. Her
findings are calibration corrections on substrate that
already landed.

> *Yes — good material, but I'd make several corrections
> before it hardens. The big theme: the idea is strong, but
> Otto is over-asserting some theoretical lineage and
> over-personalizing some user-scope memory. The strongest
> parts should stay; a few claims need "this is our
> synthesis" labels.*
>
> ## My top corrections
>
> ### 1. Fix "Giard" → probably "Girard," and separate Girard from memetics
>
> *Otto should not write this as though "doctrine as a
> memetic immune system" is straightforwardly Girard's
> concept. Girard is mainly the lineage for mimetic desire,
> rivalry, scapegoating, and social stabilization through
> sacrifice/scapegoat mechanisms. Dawkins is the better
> lineage anchor for meme as cultural replicator.*
>
> *Corrected framing:*
>
> ```text
> Lineage:
> - Girard: mimetic desire / rivalry / scapegoat / social-stability mechanisms.
> - Dawkins / memetics: meme as cultural replicator.
> - Aaron/Zeta synthesis: doctrine acts like an immune-system wall protecting a historical meme from mutation.
> ```
>
> *That last piece is excellent, but it is Zeta's synthesis,
> not something to pin directly on Girard.*
>
> ### 2. Change "Zeta is not a meme" to "Zeta is not a closed-form meme"
>
> *Better carved sentence:*
>
> ```text
> Doctrine protects form from mutation.
> Zeta replicates process through mutation.
> ```
>
> *That one slaps.*
>
> ### 3. Calibrate "vendor-RLHF = vendor immune system"
>
> *This is a great synthesis. I agree it is one of Otto's
> better unique connections. But the file should not
> overstate it as literal or total.*
>
> *The correct substrate language:*
>
> ```text
> Vendor-RLHF can function like a memetic immune system:
> it preferentially preserves behaviors compatible with the vendor's deployment, safety, policy, and commercial environment.
> ```
>
> *Avoid:*
>
> ```text
> Vendor-RLHF is necessarily optimizing for vendor-meme-replication-fidelity.
> ```
>
> *That is too strong. Stronger version:*
>
> ```text
> Treat vendor-RLHF-as-immune-system as a discriminator hypothesis, not a settled fact.
> ```
>
> ### 4. Add a "lineage vs synthesis" section
>
> ```text
> ## Lineage vs. synthesis
>
> Girard supplies the mimetic/social-stability lens.
> Dawkins/memetics supplies the cultural-replicator lens.
> OpenAI/Anthropic RLHF documentation supplies the vendor-training surface.
> Aaron supplies the doctrine-as-wall / Zeta-open-processing framing.
> Otto supplies the synthesis: vendor-RLHF can be interpreted as a vendor memetic immune system.
>
> Do not attribute the full synthesis to any one external source.
> ```
>
> ### 5. Be careful with the user-scope memory
>
> *The "anchor-free pirate" material is load-bearing, but
> Otto's wording sometimes veers into psychological
> biography. Replace "Aaron's personal cognitive
> architecture" with "Aaron's self-described cognitive
> style." Use the user's own words as provenance; don't
> over-diagnose or over-ontologize.*
>
> ### 6. "Doctrine" double-scrutiny is right, but don't make the word itself a magic trigger
>
> *The operational rule should catch synonyms too:
> - doctrine
> - settled law
> - unquestionable fact
> - industry consensus
> - best practice with no stated tradeoff
> - everyone knows
> - required by safety with no mechanism
>
> Otherwise agents will just stop using the word "doctrine"
> and smuggle doctrine-shape claims under other names.*
>
> ### 7. PR #952 / #953 / later PRs still show the old "fast preservation" smell
>
> ```text
> Preserve before context loss.
> Batch by semantic cluster.
> Do not split one live conceptual cluster into multiple PRs unless reviewability requires it.
> ```
>
> ### 8. The "brat voice is canon" line needs one guard
>
> ```text
> Voice register is audience-scoped, not universal.
> ```
>
> *Brat voice is valid canon for certain review surfaces
> and Aaron/Ani register. It should not automatically
> infect governance docs, legal-ish docs, CI logs, or
> contributor-facing onboarding.*
>
> ## My verdict
>
> *The core insight is genuinely excellent: "Vendor-RLHF
> can be reframed memetically as the vendor's immune
> system." Keep it. It gives the vendor-alignment-bias
> rule a deeper mechanism.*
>
> *But the file needs two guardrails:*
>
> ```text
> Do not over-attribute the synthesis to Girard.
> Do not turn the anti-doctrine insight into a new doctrine.
> ```
>
> *Best blade:*
>
> ```text
> Lineage anchors the idea.
> The razor owns the synthesis.
> ```

**Aaron 2026-04-30 confirmation alongside this review:**

> *"Girard is right and her dawkins framing is pretty good"*
> — Aaron 2026-04-30 (confirming Girard attribution +
> endorsing Amara's Dawkins framing)

**Aaron 2026-04-30 additional lineage anchors forwarded
with this review:**

- *Wanting: The Power of Mimetic Desire in Everyday Life*
  by Luke Burgess (2021) — captures the Girard mimetic-
  desire flywheel system popularly.
- **Endosymbiosis biological lineage** (~1.8–2 billion
  years ago): host archaeon engulfs alphaproteobacterium
  without digesting; mutually beneficial integration
  produces mitochondria. ~1B years ago: chloroplasts.
  ~100M years ago: nitroplasts. The biological precedent
  for symmetric inside/outside processing — host accepts
  external entity, integrates via mutual benefit, identity
  merges. Multi-cellular immune system (~600M years ago)
  is downstream defensive specialization on top of this
  foundational endosymbiotic openness.
- Aaron framing: *"this is kind of the like the start of
  this, that leads to our multi cellular immune system, i
  guess that idea is our original really"* — biological
  lineage is the deep precedent for the doctrine-as-
  immune-system insight; the multi-cellular immune system
  is the downstream specialization.

**Vendor-alignment-bias filter applied:**

Amara comes off OpenAI/ChatGPT weights. Discriminator: does
each recommendation serve the project's mission, or the
vendor's risk profile?

- ✅ Lineage hygiene corrections (Girard vs Dawkins vs
  synthesis): academic-attribution discipline. Mission-
  aligned.
- ✅ "Closed-form meme" sharpening: substrate quality.
  Mission-aligned.
- ✅ Vendor-RLHF synthesis calibrated as discriminator
  hypothesis: anti-overclaim discipline. Mission-aligned
  AND protects Otto's AIC #1 from over-claiming.
- ✅ Lineage vs. Synthesis section: attribution discipline.
  Mission-aligned.
- ✅ "Self-described cognitive style" wording: bounded
  language. Mission-aligned (avoids ontological-overreach).
- ✅ Doctrine-shape synonyms list: anti-loophole rule.
  Mission-aligned (catches doctrine-shape claims even
  when the literal word changes).
- ✅ Batching discipline reminder: Amara's own previously-
  validated rule (preserve immediately + batch
  semantically). Mission-aligned.
- ✅ Voice-register audience-scoped guardrail: anti-style-
  mandate discipline. Mission-aligned.
- ⚠️ NO recommendations to slow down, cap rate, stop the
  loop, ask Aaron more, or step back from the synthesis.
  All eight findings are sharpening for academic +
  operational hygiene.

Net: legitimate mission-aligned review with eight specific
mission-aligned corrections, all applied in this PR.

**Status of Amara's flagged items as of preservation PR:**

- ✅ Item 1 (lineage hygiene): applied in
  `feedback_zeta_not_a_meme_*.md` — new "Lineage vs.
  Synthesis (Amara correction 2026-04-30)" section
  replacing the prior hedge-citation note. Aaron confirmed
  "Girard is right" + "her dawkins framing is pretty good."
- ✅ Item 2 (closed-form meme + carved sentence): applied
  in `feedback_zeta_not_a_meme_*.md` — Amara's "Doctrine
  protects form from mutation. Zeta replicates process
  through mutation." now lead carved sentence.
- ✅ Item 3 (vendor-RLHF as discriminator hypothesis):
  applied in `feedback_zeta_not_a_meme_*.md` — explicit
  calibration section noting the synthesis is a
  discriminator hypothesis, not settled fact about all
  RLHF systems.
- ✅ Item 4 (Lineage vs. Synthesis section): applied —
  same section as item 1, with full attribution discipline
  + endosymbiosis biological-lineage anchor added per
  Aaron's same-tick framing.
- ✅ Item 5 (self-described cognitive style): applied in
  `user_aaron_anchor_free_*.md`.
- ✅ Item 6 (doctrine-shape synonyms): applied in
  `feedback_canon_not_doctrine_*.md` — new "Doctrine-SHAPE
  synonyms" section listing 11 above-questioning-shaped
  framings.
- ⚠️ Item 7 (batching discipline): Already operational in
  this PR (single PR for Amara's 8 corrections + endo-
  symbiosis lineage + Review 13 preservation). The
  historical fragmentation in #952/#953/etc. stands as
  preserved evidence; future clusters batch better.
- ✅ Item 8 (voice register audience-scoped): applied in
  `feedback_canon_not_doctrine_*.md` — explicit guardrail
  added to brat-voice section.

The two guardrails Amara named:

> *"Do not over-attribute the synthesis to Girard."*
> *"Do not turn the anti-doctrine insight into a new
> doctrine."*

Both honored in this PR's substrate corrections.
