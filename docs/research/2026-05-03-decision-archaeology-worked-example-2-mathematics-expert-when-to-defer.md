## The question

This is an **existence-archaeology** question (one of the five sub-modes
Aarav recommended for the `decision-archaeology` skill body) — the
artifact exists; the question asks why it's shaped that way + what
discipline it serves. Composes with **persona-notebook-archaeology** as
a secondary mode: the answer's load-bearing layer lives in a per-persona
notebook (Aarav's), not in commits or docs proper.

## Why this is a good worked example #2

Aarav's review of B-0169 named this case as one of the 3 worked-example
seeds. Three properties make it complementary to worked example #1
(double-hop abandonment, supersession-archaeology mode):

1. **Different sub-mode** — existence (why does this exist?) vs
   supersession (why was this replaced?). Demonstrates the
   skill body works across modes, not just one.
2. **Persona-notebook payoff** — the load-bearing answer lives in
   Aarav's NOTEBOOK at round 41. Without consulting persona notebooks,
   the archaeology stops at "Aaron wrote it 2026-04-19 in PR #27"
   without explaining why it became *canonical pattern* later.
3. **Substantive negative at Layer 7** — the 2026-04-21
   router-coherence ADR pair exists but is about a DIFFERENT routing
   concern (claims-tester Stage-1-vs-Stage-2 flow), not the umbrella's
   defer pattern. Demonstrates the skill body must teach contributors
   to recognize when a same-period ADR is unrelated and not assume
   doctrine-elevation occurred.

## The procedure walked, layer by layer

### Layer 1 — Frame the question

The question `"why does the mathematics-expert umbrella have a 'When to
defer' block?"` decomposes into:

- **What does the block contain?** A list of narrow-sibling skills
  (category-theory-expert, measure-theory-and-signed-measures-expert,
  numerical-analysis-and-floating-point-expert, etc.) with explicit
  "→ skill-name" routing.
- **Why is it load-bearing?** The skill itself says so (the heading
  contains "this is load-bearing"). The deeper why requires layers 7
  + 9.
- **When did it become canonical?** Different question from "when was
  it authored" — needs round-history + persona-notebook archaeology.

### Layer 2 — Surface layer: `git blame` on the canonical file

```bash
git blame -L 30,49 .claude/skills/mathematics-expert/SKILL.md
```

Returns:

```
5fdc72bf (Aaron Stainback 2026-04-19 20:01:01 -0400 30) ## When to defer (this is load-bearing)
5fdc72bf (Aaron Stainback 2026-04-19 20:01:01 -0400 31)
5fdc72bf (Aaron Stainback 2026-04-19 20:01:01 -0400 32) Defer to the narrow skill whenever a prompt cleanly lands
5fdc72bf (Aaron Stainback 2026-04-19 20:01:01 -0400 33) in its lane. The umbrella exists to *route*, not to
5fdc72bf (Aaron Stainback 2026-04-19 20:01:01 -0400 34) compete:
... (lines 35-49: 6 narrow-sibling defer-rules)
```

**Layer-2 output:** the entire "When to defer" block landed in a single
commit, `5fdc72bf`, on 2026-04-19 by the human maintainer. No subsequent
edits to the block — `git blame` shows ONE commit owns all 20 lines.

This is meaningfully different from worked example #1's supersession case
(where blame surfaced multiple commits incrementally building the marker).
Existence-archaeology often gets a single-commit blame; the load-bearing
context lives elsewhere.

### Layer 3 — Commit context: `git show 5fdc72bf`

```bash
git show --stat 5fdc72bf | head -10
```

Returns:

```
Round 34: factory + public-repo alignment + first DB tests (#27)
```

**Layer-3 output:** the umbrella SKILL.md was authored as part of "Round
34: factory + public-repo alignment + first DB tests" — a multi-area
commit covering the early skill-substrate creation. The "When to defer"
block was one piece of a larger factory-alignment effort, not a standalone
decision. PR #27 is the commit context but doesn't itself explain *why*
the block became canonical.

### Layer 4 — String archaeology

```bash
grep -l "umbrella exists to" .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md
```

Returns BOTH `.claude/skills/mathematics-expert/SKILL.md` AND
`.claude/skills/physics-expert/SKILL.md`. The "umbrella exists to"
verbatim phrase has been **replicated to a sibling umbrella** —
physics-expert carries the same pattern.

**Layer-4 output:** the pattern is canonical-by-replication. The
mathematics-expert SKILL.md is the **earlier instance** (per `git
blame` dates on each file), but it's been deliberately copied into
physics-expert. The replication itself is evidence the pattern was
treated as a canonical exemplar to follow — even though no formal
ADR canonicalized it (Layer 7 will confirm this is a substantive
negative result).

### Layer 5 — Function archaeology

Not applicable. The "When to defer" block is markdown procedure-doc, not
code; this layer no-ops for skill-body documentation.

### Layer 6 — Round-history shards

```bash
ls docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/04/ | head -3
```

Returns: `28`, `29`, `30` — the earliest tick-shard directory under
2026/04/ is `04/28`, **NINE DAYS AFTER** the umbrella SKILL.md was
authored (2026-04-19). There are no tick shards from the authoring
window because **the tick-shard discipline started later than the
umbrella authoring**.

**Layer-6 output:** substantive negative — pre-shard-discipline
substrate cannot be archaeologically traced through tick shards; it
must be traced through other layers (commit + persona-notebook +
ADR + memos). This itself teaches contributors: **substrate boundaries
matter**. The round-history surface is dense for 2026-04-28+ work but
sparse / nonexistent for earlier substrate. Decision-archaeology must
recognize when a layer is empty by-substrate-design rather than by
omission.

### Layer 7 — ADRs

```bash
grep -liE "When to defer|mathematics-expert|umbrella exists" docs/DECISIONS/*.md
```

Returns nothing. **No ADR mentions the umbrella's "When to defer"
pattern.** The router-coherence ADR pair
(`2026-04-21-router-coherence-claims-vs-complexity.md` v1 →
`2026-04-21-router-coherence-v2.md` v2) does exist, but those ADRs
are about a different routing concern entirely — the
**claims-tester** Stage-1-vs-Stage-2 routing flow (Hiroshi analytic
proof vs Daisy empirical measurement), not about the
mathematics-expert umbrella's defer-block.

**Layer-7 output:** **substantive negative** — no ADR canonicalized
the umbrella's "When to defer" pattern. This is meaningful: the
pattern is canonical-by-replication-and-notebook-recognition (per
Layer 4 + Layer 9), NOT by ADR-decree. Different elevation paths
lead to canonical-status; the skill body must teach contributors to
recognize when the elevation lives outside ADRs. **The earlier draft
of this worked example claimed the v2 ADR cited the umbrella's
pattern; that claim was empirically false** — verified empirically
via `grep -li "When to defer" docs/DECISIONS/*.md` returning no
matches. The worked example itself is now also a worked example of
the verify-then-claim drift class (semantic-equivalence drift on a
load-bearing claim about ADR content).

### Layer 8 — Named-decision memos

```bash
grep -lE "When to defer|umbrella exists to" memory/feedback_*.md
```

Returns no specific feedback memo named for the pattern. The doctrine
lives in the ADR pair (Layer 7) + Aarav's notebook (Layer 9), not in
a named-rule memo.

**Layer-8 output:** another substantive negative result — not every
load-bearing pattern gets a feedback memo; some live in ADR + persona-
notebook substrate. The skill body should teach contributors to read
all 11 layers, not give up when one returns nothing.

### Layer 9 — Persona notebooks

```bash
grep -A2 -E "When to defer|umbrella has a" memory/persona/aarav/NOTEBOOK.md
```

Returns:

```
- 2026-04-20 (round 41) -- mathematics-expert umbrella has a
  strong "When to defer" block naming every narrow sibling;
  router-coherence discipline the factory now uses widely.
  ... other umbrella skills should pattern-match on. No action,
  but worth referencing when other umbrellas are tuned.
```

**Layer-9 output:** *this is the load-bearing layer for the question.*
Aarav (skill-tune-up persona) explicitly noted at round 41 (2026-04-20,
one day after authoring) that the umbrella's defer-block IS the canonical
pattern — and named it as the model other umbrellas should follow. The
persona-notebook entry preceded the ADR pair (v1 + v2 land 2026-04-21);
Aarav's observation is what drove the doctrine into the ADRs.

This is the kind of load-bearing context that **doesn't appear at any
other layer.** Without consulting Aarav's notebook, the archaeology
stops at "Aaron wrote it as part of round 34 factory alignment" without
explaining *why it became canonical*.

### Layer 10 — Conversation archives

`docs/research/` doesn't carry a specific worked example for this
case (other than this very document, recursively). The conversations
that produced the pattern are pre-Drive-bridge era (round 34 was
2026-04-19; Drive-bridge ferry pattern emerged later); the canonical
durable form is the SKILL.md + ADR + persona-notebook trio.

### Layer 11 — WONT-DO archaeology + retired-SKILL.md history

```bash
grep -iE "When to defer|mathematics-expert" docs/WONT-DO.md
```

Returns nothing. The pattern is not in WONT-DO; it's a positive-pattern
canonical-doctrine, not a deprecation.

```bash
git log --oneline --diff-filter=D --all -- .claude/skills/ | grep -iE "math"
```

Returns no deletion of math-related skills; the umbrella + narrow-siblings
are all live. No retired-SKILL.md history relevant here.

**Layer-11 output:** another substantive negative — patterns that
become canonical positive-doctrine don't show up in rejection-archaeology
surfaces. This complements worked example #1 (which DID surface negative
content via the abandonment lifecycle); the contrast is itself
substantive.

## The synthesized answer

The mathematics-expert umbrella SKILL.md's "When to defer" block exists
because:

1. **Origin (2026-04-19):** the maintainer authored it as part of round 34 factory
   + public-repo alignment (PR #27, commit 5fdc72b). The block was one
   piece of a multi-area factory-substrate creation; not a standalone
   decision.
2. **Replication to a sibling umbrella (date undetermined; ≥ 2026-04-19):**
   the same "umbrella exists to" verbatim phrase appears in
   `.claude/skills/physics-expert/SKILL.md` — the pattern was deliberately
   copied to a sibling. Replication-without-ADR is itself a canonicalization
   signal: someone treated the math-expert version as the exemplar to follow.
3. **Recognition as canonical (2026-04-20):** Aarav (skill-tune-up
   persona) noted at round 41 in his notebook that the block was a
   "strong" exemplar naming every narrow sibling, with the explicit
   observation that other umbrella skills should pattern-match on it.
   **This is the only explicit recognition-as-canonical signal** in the
   substrate; no ADR, no named-decision memo, no commit-message elevation.
4. **No ADR canonicalization (substantive negative):** despite the
   2026-04-21 router-coherence ADR pair landing 2 days after the umbrella
   authoring, those ADRs are about the **claims-tester Stage-1-vs-Stage-2
   routing flow** — a different routing concern. No ADR elevated the
   umbrella's defer-block into project-wide doctrine.
5. **Load-bearing now:** the block is "load-bearing" because every
   narrow-sibling skill exists at the same router-trigger surface;
   without an explicit defer-block, the umbrella + narrow-siblings
   would compete for routing and produce unpredictable behavior. The
   pattern is what makes the multi-skill router coherent.

The doctrine's emergence followed a **canonical-by-replication-and-notebook-recognition**
path, NOT a canonical-by-ADR-decree path. Decision-archaeology that
stops at "no ADR found" misses Layer 4 (replication evidence) + Layer 9
(persona-notebook recognition). Different elevation paths exist; the
skill body must teach contributors to recognize which path applies in
each case.

## What this worked example demonstrates

For the eventual `decision-archaeology` SKILL.md body:

1. **Single-commit blame is common for existence-archaeology cases.**
   Unlike supersession cases (worked example #1), existence-archaeology
   often gets one commit + the load-bearing context lives elsewhere.
   The skill must teach contributors to KEEP GOING past Layer 2 even
   when the blame trail is short.
2. **Persona notebooks are non-trivially load-bearing.** Layer 9 carried
   the answer here; Layer 8 (named-decision memos) returned nothing.
   The skill body should not skip persona notebooks just because they're
   "user-scope-feeling" substrate — they're factory-canonical.
3. **The doctrine emerges across layers + dates, not in a single
   moment.** Three layers (commit + notebook + ADR) span three days
   (04-19 → 04-20 → 04-21). The skill teaches contributors to walk the
   timeline, not just the origin.
4. **Substantive negatives at Layers 8 + 11 confirm + locate the
   load-bearing layer.** Negative results at multiple layers tell the
   contributor "look elsewhere" — they're directional signal, not
   wasted queries.
5. **Both worked examples (#1 supersession + #2 existence) walk all
   11 layers.** The procedure is consistent across modes; only the
   answer-shape differs (negative-result-rich for supersession;
   positive-pattern-canonical-doctrine for existence).

## Composes with

- **B-0169** — the row this is a worked example for. References this
  artifact via the `worked-example-seeds` section.
- **`docs/research/2026-05-02-decision-archaeology-worked-example-1-double-hop-abandonment.md`** —
  worked example #1; pair-companion. Together demonstrate two distinct
  sub-modes (supersession + existence).
- **`.claude/skills/mathematics-expert/SKILL.md`** — the canonical
  artifact whose existence the question investigates.
- **`docs/DECISIONS/2026-04-21-router-coherence-claims-vs-complexity.md`** +
  **`docs/DECISIONS/2026-04-21-router-coherence-v2.md`** — Layer-7
  ADR pair establishing the elevation-to-doctrine.
- **`memory/persona/aarav/NOTEBOOK.md`** (round 41 entry) — Layer-9
  persona-notebook substrate carrying the load-bearing recognition.

## What's next

Per Aarav's BP-14 (3 worked examples before skill-creator authors
SKILL.md):

- ✅ Worked example #1 — double-hop abandonment (supersession-archaeology
  mode) on main since 2026-05-02
- ✅ Worked example #2 — mathematics-expert "When to defer" pattern
  (existence-archaeology + persona-notebook layer demonstration; this
  document)
- ⏳ Worked example #3 — BP-24 deceased-family-emulation rule
  (attribution-archaeology mode + sacred-tier substrate handling).
  Pending; lands in a subsequent PR.

Once worked example #3 lands, skill-creator can author
`.claude/skills/decision-archaeology/SKILL.md` with confidence that
the procedure-body is grounded in 3 empirically-walked cases across 3
distinct sub-modes.
