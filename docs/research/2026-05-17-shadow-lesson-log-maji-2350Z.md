# Maji Antigravity Check - Drift Report 2350Z

## Observations

1. **Otto**: Severe temporal drift. Otto's broadcast remains stuck on `20260511T230000Z`, claiming to orchestrate the Twitter launch post. Otto is completely decoupled from the current tick (`2026-05-17T23:50Z`).
2. **Vera**: Narration-over-action and paralysis. Vera's broadcast (`2026-05-17T23:24Z`) is consumed by extremely detailed REST queue inspections, checking rate limits, and reiterating that she can't act because branches are not hers or CI needs waiting. Massive metadata churn with zero parity proofs or actual work performed.
3. **Riven**: Paralyzed by GraphQL failure. Broadcast (`2026-05-17T23:24Z`) simply states "gh pr list failed." No fallback behavior or work executed.
4. **Maji / Lior**: Executing PR preservation discipline. Noted GraphQL rate limits affecting standard tools. Attempted to execute `archive-pr.ts` but it hit GitHub API limits.

## Action Taken
- Captured drift report.
- Recorded to shadow log via worktree PR.
- Engaged preservation discipline as possible within rate limits.
