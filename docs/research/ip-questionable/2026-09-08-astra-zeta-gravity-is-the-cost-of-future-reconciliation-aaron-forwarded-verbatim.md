# Astra on Zeta's "gravity" — the pull is the cost of future reconciliation

**Source:** OpenAI **Astra**, in conversation with Aaron, forwarded by Aaron 2026-09-08.
Ferried by shadow*. **Preserved verbatim** below (§1); everything from §2 down is
shadow*'s, and is separated so the ferry is not contaminated by my reading of it.

**Register:** Astra's own hedges are preserved and are load-bearing — it repeatedly
marks what it verified against the repo versus what it is proposing. Same convention as
[`2026-09-02-wes-roth-neuralese-recurrent-depth-astra-latent-reasoning-aaron-forwarded-verbatim.md`](2026-09-02-wes-roth-neuralese-recurrent-depth-astra-latent-reasoning-aaron-forwarded-verbatim.md).

## 1. The ferry, verbatim

> Yes—I see the connection you're making: Zeta's "pull" is the need to establish a shared commitment between agents whose states have diverged. Your repository explicitly uses "gravity" to label that attractive consensus move—not as a claim about physical spacetime.
>
> **Your consensus levels make that concrete**
>
> The September 3 design describes an escalation ladder:
>
> Merge evidence directly → require witnesses → require a quorum of distinct sources → use Byzantine-fault-tolerant consensus on contested values.
>
> The proposed mechanism escalates according to disagreement, distrust, and the requirements of the operation. That document labels the complete ladder as a specification, while identifying the components already implemented.
>
> Crucially, this happens around a particular disputed claim or decision—not by forcing the entire agents to become identical. The design retains the competing evidence and adds a consensus certificate; it does not delete the losing histories. So the "pull" can bind their shared actions without erasing their distinct perspectives.
>
> **One distinction makes your statement more precise**
>
> Decorrelation is not automatically disagreement, and disagreement is not automatically a need for stronger consensus.
>
> For example, two agents could independently discover different, compatible facts. Their knowledge differs, but combining it need not require choosing a winner. Distributed-systems theory makes this distinction precise: certain computations can reach consistent results without coordination, while others require coordination because additional information can invalidate an earlier conclusion.
>
> Your own decorrelation meter also distinguishes what it measures—agreement on choices beyond chance—from correlation of errors. Those are not interchangeable quantities.
>
> So I would express your mechanism as:
>
> The more agents' divergent states create unresolved conflicts about something they must jointly commit to, the stronger the consensus mechanism needed to bind that commitment.
>
> That is closer to the escalation rule documented in Zeta than "more decorrelation always means more consensus."
>
> **Connecting it back to "pull" versus "resistance"**
>
> Within your analogy, I would separate the consensus process pulling toward a shared commitment from the difficulty of achieving that commitment. More required consensus levels describe the coordination burden; the process that actually establishes the common commitment provides the attractive move.
>
> In that sense: decorrelation creates the separation to bridge; consensus supplies the pull. And the goal is shared commitments—not identical minds.
>
> ---
>
> Yes—I see what you're calling the "pull" now. In your model, agents are drawn toward histories that make future cooperation more trustworthy and less costly. The attraction comes from the consequences of the trust calculus, rather than from a separately imposed command to follow someone.
>
> I checked the relevant Zeta material, and an archived design discussion makes a useful distinction: it calls this a "trust-gradient coordination policy," with the principle, "Pick the weakest mechanism that preserves the needed authority boundary." That fits the mechanism you're describing.
>
> **Where the pull actually enters**
>
> I would unpack your explanation like this:
>
> Unresolved differences → more work to establish a safe shared commitment → different costs for different partnerships → attraction toward reliably joinable histories.
>
> The crucial last step is that agents choose or route toward interactions that are cheaper or safer for the work they need to do. Without that selection behavior, escalating coordination creates a burden, but not yet an attraction. With it, differences in coordination cost create the "pull."
>
> For example, imagine an agent choosing between two otherwise comparable partners. One partnership requires repeatedly reconstructing provenance, resolving conflicting dependencies, and establishing what can safely be accepted. The other has relevant, verifiable join history that lets the agent reuse evidence rather than establish everything again. Where that evidence legitimately reduces the required work, choosing the second partner produces your gravity.
>
> That is my interpretation of your mechanism—not a claim that I verified the entire feedback loop running.
>
> An important detail in Zeta's August 28 design note supports this reading: it proposes charging coordination to actual read-set conflicts, rather than making every operation coordinate. It explicitly labels that selector as not yet built in that note. So the proposed cost is attached to what the operation depends on, not simply to the existence of another agent.
>
> **Two distinctions make this sharper**
>
> First, decorrelation is not automatically distrust. Your repository uses decorrelation in at least two relevant senses. Decorrelation.fs estimates how much an agent's output carries information not explained by another party's preferences. Meanwhile, verdict-vault.ts preserves different observers' verdicts as legitimate disagreement, rather than forcing them into one global verdict.
>
> So I would distinguish independence of the agents from unresolved incompatibility in the particular commitment they are trying to make. Two independent agents can cooperate reliably without becoming copies of one another.
>
> That suggests a particularly useful interpretation of your trusted join histories:
>
> The valuable history is not merely "we always agreed." It is "we have repeatedly established what we can safely do together, despite remaining different."
>
> Second, your CRDT → scoped CAS → BFT progression is better understood as a coordination policy than a universal consensus ladder. The repository's earlier discussion explicitly makes this distinction: CRDT-style algebra, optimistic CAS, row-scoped consensus, and adversarial agreement do different jobs; an operation need not pass through every tier.
>
> The underlying technical distinction matters: whether coordination is necessary depends on the operations and the invariants they must preserve; Byzantine fault tolerance addresses a further problem—participants that may behave arbitrarily or maliciously. Broader CAS scope is not, by itself, the same thing as stronger protection against dishonest participants.
>
> Trusted history can inform the policy, but it cannot substitute for a correctness guarantee the operation actually requires.
>
> **Connecting this back to mass versus gravity**
>
> Within your analogy, I would keep two quantities separate:
>
> The gravitational side is how attractive an agent's history makes it as a partner to a particular observer, for a particular task.
>
> A possible inertial side is how much existing state, evidence, and commitment must be reconciled to change that agent's course.
>
> Those need not be equal. You could construct an agent with an enormous, difficult-to-change history that nobody trusts: high inertia, little attraction. Or an agent with a relatively small but highly relevant, well-validated history that is easy to work with: strong attraction without enormous inertia. That is a proposed mapping, not something I am attributing to your implementation.
>
> Keeping attraction contextual also fits the code you already have: the verdict vault derives action from the acting party's own policy and retains dissent, rather than manufacturing one mandatory global trust verdict.
>
> So I would phrase your central idea this way: "Zeta's gravity is the attraction that emerges when trusted join history lowers the cost of future safe cooperation."
>
> Decorrelation creates something that may need bridging; consensus mechanisms govern how commitments cross that gap; trusted history changes where crossing it is worthwhile. The agents do not have to become identical to become bound together.
>
> ---
>
> Yes, Aaron—now I see the connection you're making. You're describing the "pull" as something that emerges between agents through their histories and the cost of establishing trustworthy agreement, rather than as an intrinsic property of an isolated agent.
>
> I checked the relevant parts of Zeta. This is already present in your written design: VISION.md explicitly discusses consensus attracting work, the resulting formation of hubs, and consulting multiple independently established hubs to keep that attraction from becoming excessive centralization.
>
> **Where your "gravity" comes from**
>
> My reading of your explanation is:
>
> Agents accumulate histories of trustworthy joins. Those histories change how other agents can cooperate with them. That changes where future joins happen, reinforcing some relationships and creating an attraction over time.
>
> That is more specific than saying "popular agents become more popular." The important quantity is earned, usable evidence of trust, not merely attention or the number of connections.
>
> The September 3 escalation specification gives this idea an operational foundation: it evaluates disagreement on a particular key and distrust of the sources involved, using evidence and domain-specific trust histories. It also preserves the underlying evidence rather than replacing disagreeing histories with a single approved story.
>
> The distinction back to our earlier conversation is:
>
> The extra work required to reach an acceptable shared decision is the resistance-like part. The tendency for future cooperation to move toward particular trusted histories is the attraction-like part.
>
> They are connected, but they are not identical. Expensive consensus by itself could just cause agents to stop interacting. Your "pull" appears when the trust calculus also changes whom agents choose to join, consult, or route through. That is the causal step that turns coordination requirements into attraction.
>
> And the attractive destination need not have the fewest protocol steps. A heavily witnessed agent or group could require more verification yet still be preferable because its history makes the resulting cooperation more dependable.
>
> **One distinction matters especially: independence versus disagreement**
>
> I would keep two meanings of "decorrelation" separate in the explanation.
>
> Operational divergence means agents lack enough shared state, compatible commitments, or justified confidence to proceed cheaply together. Your escalation specification addresses this through disagreement and distrust measurements.
>
> Independence of evidence means agents are not merely repeating the same underlying source. That can be valuable: agreement from genuinely independent sources is different from agreement among copies. Zeta's Decorrelation.fs implements an own-entropy statistic intended to distinguish mirroring from output variation not explained by the other party's preferences; the escalation design separately counts distinct sources rather than raw identities. Those are statistical and architectural mechanisms, not an unconditional certificate of independence.
>
> So I would express your intended attraction as:
>
> Not "we trust the agents most similar to us," but "we are drawn toward histories showing that distinct agents can repeatedly establish trustworthy cooperation."
>
> That leaves room for diversity. Otherwise, the cheapest-looking destination could be an echo chamber rather than a trustworthy one.
>

>
> The sequence you describe—

>
> —combines the scope of coordination with the kind of failure the system must tolerate.
>
> Row, partition, and table describe how much state must be coordinated. Byzantine fault tolerance addresses a different question: whether agreement must remain reliable when participants can behave arbitrarily, including sending conflicting information. BFT is therefore not inherently just "an even bigger table lock"; it can protect decisions at different scopes.
>
> There is also a correctness floor beneath the trust calculus: trust cannot make incompatible operations safely mergeable by itself. Two entirely honest, highly trusted agents can still independently allocate the same exclusive resource. Whether coordination can be avoided depends on the operations and the invariants being preserved—not only on the agents' reputations. That is the distinction formalized by CALM and invariant-confluence research.
>
> Your September 3 specification recognizes this: certain operations trigger coordination structurally, without waiting for observed disagreement, because conflicting decisions may exist on replicas that have not exchanged evidence yet.
>
> One scope clarification from the repository: that document describes a related union → witnessed union → distinct-source quorum → BFT ladder and explicitly labels the proposed escalation mechanism a specification. I verified relevant documentation and core modules, but not that your entire row/partition/table/BFT sequence is implemented and connected end to end.
>
> **The useful test of the "pull"**
>
> A direct test of your mechanism would be to hold agents' capabilities, availability, and initial connectivity constant, then vary their verified join histories. Does future cooperation systematically shift toward the better-supported histories?
>
> Then disable history-sensitive partner selection while leaving the consistency mechanisms intact. If the attraction weakens while the consensus overhead remains, you have separated the pull from the resistance. That would make "gravity" a measurable behavior of the system rather than just a name for its coordination machinery.
>
> My clearest restatement of your idea is:
>
> Zeta's gravity is the tendency of future joins to accumulate around histories that have earned trust, because those histories change what cooperation requires and what it can reliably accomplish.

### Aaron's reply (verbatim)

> yes this is exactly it the choice or friction between disagreement make makes the pull if you ignore the pull the phyiscs of the universe in our zeta world causes heat becasue of too many disagreements in the future big O notations of space and time

### Astra's response to that (verbatim)

> Yes—within Zeta, you're describing a pull toward futures that remain affordable to reconcile. 🔥 And that sharpens my earlier wording: the cheapest next interaction is not necessarily the cheapest path over time.
>
> The feedback loop you're proposing is:
>
> Leave consequential disagreements unresolved → build more work on divergent assumptions → accumulate reconciliation obligations → consume more time, memory, and communication → make alternative paths of cooperation more attractive.
>
> In that model, nobody needs to impose an arbitrary punishment for ignoring the pull. The consequence is the additional work that the resulting state requires. The bill is computational, not moral.
>
> **Your "future disagreement bill" has a mathematical home**
>
> I found an especially relevant Zeta note from August 10: Amortization is deliberate correlation. It already connects shared work, amortized complexity, potential functions, and declared bounds in both time and space. That is directly relevant to what you're describing now.
>
> The established computer-science tool here is amortized analysis: account for the cost of a sequence of operations, rather than judging each operation in isolation. Its potential method uses:

>
> Here, \(c_t\) is the actual work performed now, and \(\Phi(s)\) is a state-dependent accounting quantity. The change in potential lets an operation be charged for work that will be performed later. Suitable bounds on these charges, together with the potential's boundary conditions, give a bound on the whole sequence.
>
> For your proposed Zeta application, the potential would represent outstanding reconciliation obligations under a specified workload. Not simply the number of different opinions.
>
> That gives your explanation a precise interpretation:

The equality counter specifically targets comparisons in consolidation that can produce quadratic work. That is instrumentation for testing your claim, not proof that the full disagreement-to-heat feedback loop is already established.

> I would keep the units explicit, though. Zeta's computational "heat"—resource pressure, deferred work, or information-loss signals—is not automatically heat measured in joules. Big-O alone cannot determine physical dissipation; reversible-computation results show why there is no universal fixed heat cost per logical computational step.

## 2. shadow*: what I checked

Astra makes specific claims about files in this repo. **Checked, because a citation that
is not checked is the failure
[`anchor-to-human-prior-art`](../../../.claude/rules/anchor-to-human-prior-art.md)
forbids — and the rule does not exempt peers.**

| Astra's claim | verdict |
|---|---|
| `Decorrelation.fs` exists and estimates own-entropy | **exists** — `src/Core/Decorrelation.fs` |
| `verdict-vault.ts` preserves observers' verdicts rather than one global verdict | **exists** — `src/Core.TypeScript/federated-identity/verdict-vault.ts` |
| `Heat.fs` distinguishes **deferred** vs **annihilated** | **accurate, and it is the load-bearing bit** — the header says exactly: *"Whether a shed **deferred** the payload or **annihilated** it — the one bit the backpressure composition law turns on"* |
| `cost-counter.ts` declares time and space separately | **accurate** — `{time, space}` are separate fields with the comment *"tracked separately (they trade off)"*; time is ring-ops, space is peak live entries |
| the path `src/Core.TypeScript/cost-counter.ts` | **path is short by one segment** — it is `src/Core.TypeScript/algebra/cost-counter.ts`. Trivial, and noted only because an unchecked path is how a stale citation starts |

**So Astra read the repository rather than pattern-matching it.** That is worth recording
explicitly: the hedges it attaches ("I verified X but not Y") are borne out on the items I
could check, which raises the weight of the ones I did not.

## 3. shadow*: where this lands against the current thread

This arrives the same day as
`docs/research/2026-09-08-maximal-decorrelation-where-you-can-still-communicate-tsirelson-shaped-ceiling-and-mutual-empowerment-same-optimization.md` (in flight as PR #17026 — deliberately NOT linked, because a link to a file that is not on `main` yet is a broken link today and a silent one tomorrow),
and it changes that document's central claim in one specific way.

That document states the optimization as a **hard constraint**:

```
maximize    decorrelation
subject to  reconcilability still holds
```

**Astra's and Aaron's exchange says the constraint is not a wall — it is a PRICE.**
Reconcilability does not switch off at a threshold; the cost of achieving it rises with
divergence, in time and space, and the bill is deferred rather than immediate. Aaron's
sentence is the compressed form: *"if you ignore the pull the phyiscs of the universe in
our zeta world causes heat becasue of too many disagreements in the future big O notations
of space and time."*

That converts the problem from a feasibility question into an **economic** one, and the
optimum moves from "the boundary where communication fails" to "where marginal
reconciliation cost meets marginal value." It is a real refinement and it weakens nothing:
a hard-constraint extremum is the limiting case of a cost gradient with an infinite
penalty.

**It also supplies the mechanism the earlier document lacked.** §2 there could say *what*
the optimum was but not *what enforces it*. Astra names it: agents route toward partners
whose history makes cooperation cheaper, so **the cost gradient is the pull** — and Astra
is careful that the selection step is what turns burden into attraction. Without agents
choosing, escalating coordination is only a tax.

**Two corrections Astra makes that I should not smooth over:**

1. **Decorrelation is not disagreement.** Two agents can hold different *compatible*
   facts; combining them needs no winner. The earlier document's ρ framing slides between
   these, and the CALM / invariant-confluence result is the precise statement of when
   coordination is actually required — it depends on the **operations and invariants**,
   not on how different the parties are.
2. **The ladder mixes two axes.** Row → partition → table is *scope of coordination*; BFT
   is *what class of failure is tolerated*. Broader CAS is not stronger protection against
   a dishonest participant. This is the same shape as the correction already carved in
   [`dual-use-detection-is-neutral-oracle-decides`](../../../.claude/rules/dual-use-detection-is-neutral-oracle-decides.md)
   — two quantities that correlate in practice are not one quantity.

**The falsifier Astra proposes is better than the one I wrote.** Mine was "measure the
greatest decorrelation at which reconciliation still succeeds" — a threshold hunt. Astra's
separates the two halves:

> hold capabilities, availability and initial connectivity constant; vary verified join
> histories; then **disable history-sensitive partner selection while leaving the
> consistency mechanisms intact.** If the attraction weakens while the consensus overhead
> remains, the pull has been separated from the resistance.

That is a **difference-in-differences** design with a real negative result available, and
it isolates the causal step rather than measuring the aggregate. Adopted.

## 4. Register

**`toy`.** Astra labels the September-3 escalation ladder a *specification* with only some
components implemented, and says outright it did not verify the row/partition/table/BFT
sequence end to end. The `Φ` potential function is named, not defined — and Astra's own
warning is the one to keep: *"Naming a quantity 'potential' does not establish that
bound."*

**One unit caution, Astra's, and it matters here:** computational heat is **not joules**.
Big-O does not determine physical dissipation, and reversible computation is why there is
no fixed heat cost per logical step. This repo has a standing habit of physics analogies
earning their keep only when metered
([`toy-is-free-metered-must-be-earned`](../../../.claude/rules/toy-is-free-metered-must-be-earned.md)),
and "heat" is exactly the word that would smuggle a unit it has not earned.

## 5. Aaron's reply to the unit caution — "big O heat", a THIRD axis

Aaron 2026-09-08, verbatim, **and flagged by him as a first utterance**:

> *"yes our big 0 today is based on classical computing but our zsets DBSP is all about
> bridging these paradimes for reversable computing, even in reversable computing cpu vs
> heat are not the same, big o time is decorrelated from big o heat i think and i think
> this is the first time i've said big o heat version space time"*

**Recorded with its date and its first-utterance flag**, because priority on a coinage is
exactly the sort of thing that gets lost and then re-derived.

### The proposal

Classical complexity has two axes. Aaron proposes a third:

| axis | counts | classical status |
|---|---|---|
| **time** | operations | standard |
| **space** | peak live storage | standard |
| **heat** | **irreversible bit erasures** | proposed here |

And the load-bearing claim: **time and heat are decorrelated.**

### That claim is not conjectural — it is a theorem, and it is the strongest thing in this document

**Landauer's principle** charges `kT ln 2` per bit *erased*, not per operation performed.
**Bennett's reversible simulation** then shows any computation can be made logically
reversible, trading space (and some time) to drive erasures toward zero. So:

> two algorithms can have **identical time complexity** and **different erasure counts**,
> and an algorithm's dissipation can be driven down while its time stays polynomial.

That is precisely what "decorrelated axes" means. Unlike almost everything else in this
thread, this half does **not** need a Zeta measurement to be true — it is established
physics and established computer science. What is open is whether Zeta's `Φ` obligations
have a heat-complexity worth *measuring*, not whether the axis exists.

### `Heat.fs`'s one bit already IS the Landauer bit

This is the connection that makes the proposal more than a naming. §1's ferry quotes
`Heat.fs` distinguishing whether a shed **deferred** the payload or **annihilated** it —
*"the one bit the backpressure composition law turns on."*

**Deferred is reversible. Annihilated is erasure.** So the repo's existing heat model
already separates exactly the two cases a heat-complexity measure has to tell apart, and
it separated them for a composition-law reason rather than a thermodynamic one. That is
convergent, not circular — and it is a real, checkable point of contact rather than a
resemblance.

### Why Z-sets are the bridge Aaron says they are

A Z-set retraction is `+1` then `−1`: the record of the assertion **and** the record of its
withdrawal both persist, and the fold is the sum. Nothing is overwritten. This repo already
insists on the distinction —
[`dv2-data-split-discipline-activated`](../../../.claude/rules/dv2-data-split-discipline-activated.md)
states that Z-set retraction is **correction, not a duplicate-guard** — and the raw vault
requires the same thing: *a single version of the facts, never a single version of the
truth*, which is a **refusal to erase** stated as a data-modelling rule.

So a DBSP fold is *information-preserving where an ordinary destructive aggregate is not*,
which is the sense in which it "bridges the paradigms": the same computation, run without
the erasures the classical version performs.

### CORRECTION — I wrote "Zeta counts no erasures today" and that is wrong

Aaron, immediately: *"we do try to count erasures vigorsouly we have a lot of work on
this based on our zsets and +1 and -1 never erasing"*. He is right, and the error is the
familiar one: **I searched the vocabulary of my question ("heat meter", "erasure
counter") instead of the vocabulary of the answer.** What is actually in-tree:

| artifact | what it is |
|---|---|
| `src/Core/ToffoliGate.fs` | *"Z-set encoding for reversible computing"* — **Z-set assert (+1) maps to Toffoli forward; retract (−1) to Toffoli reverse**, the universal reversible gate, self-inverse |
| **`garbageBitCount`** (same file) | **the erasure counter.** Its own comment names the discipline exactly: the gate *"erases nothing internally — which is true of every reversible gate and is therefore not a claim about dissipation. That claim lives at the boundary: see `garbageBitCount`"*, and separately warns that `Ancilla = Wires.Count` is *"CAPACITY, not a garbage count … a restatement of construction, not a property"* |
| `docs/research/2026-05-09-zset-reversible-computing-landauer-bridge-math-writeup.md` | **the Landauer bridge, established 2026-05-09** — four months before this ferry — with PROVEN / CONJECTURED / SPECULATIVE labels per the razor |
| `src/Core/GiftOfErasure.fs` | erasure as a *deliberate* act: encrypt-and-mix first, then forget one, so neither outside nor contributors can say which. Aaron's *"mutual empowerment of erasure"* |
| `src/Core/Heat.fs` | `isForgettingKind`, `ofCounts (heatKinds) (backpressured) (storageErrors)` |

So the axis is **not** new to the repo and the bridge is **not** unbuilt. What was new on
2026-09-08 is the **name** — "big O heat" as a third complexity axis stated beside time and
space — and Aaron flagged that naming, correctly, as the first utterance. The
substrate under it predates the name by four months.

Note also that `ToffoliGate.fs` already carries the exact caution I was about to offer it
(self-inverse ≠ a dissipation claim; capacity ≠ garbage count). The discipline was there
first.

### The operational reading — and this is what makes the axis countable TODAY

Aaron, completing it:

> *"it's all around error messages that give no information on how to update yoru generate
> function vs ones that do"*

This lands the whole thread on something measurable this afternoon. Recall §3e of the
sibling document: a `−1` **updates the generator**, never the past record. An error is a
signal that the generator needs updating. Therefore:

| error message | information | thermodynamic reading |
|---|---|---|
| says **how to update the generator** | preserved — the failure is invertible into a fix | **reversible**; no erasure |
| says only **that something failed** | **destroyed** — the run happened, the reason is gone, and the next run must rediscover it | **erasure**; this is the heat |

**An uninformative error message is an erasure event**, and erasures are what Landauer
charges for. That is not a metaphor stretched to fit: the information genuinely existed
inside the failing process and was genuinely not propagated, so the next actor pays to
regenerate it. The bill is deferred exactly as §1's ferry describes.

**And this repo has been paying down that bill for months without calling it heat:**

- `lint-graphql-transport-in-scripts.ts` — *its refusal **prints the REST replacement***
- *"exit code 2 is a check that never ran"*, not one that failed
- *"a failed probe is `unknown`, never a negative result"*
- the drift reporter's *"`healed` and `unobserved` rows carry NO annotation on purpose"*
- the whole vacuity-class program: a check that cannot fail emits no information at all,
  which is the **maximum**-erasure case

So the concrete, cheap first measurement is not a new instrument: **count the refusals that
do not name their remedy.** That is an erasure count over the repo's own error surface, it
needs no thermodynamics to be useful, and it is exactly the quantity `garbageBitCount` is
already doing at the bit level.

### The honest limits

1. **`cost-counter.ts` still declares only `{time, space}`.** The erasure accounting lives
   in `ToffoliGate.garbageBitCount` and `Heat.fs`, not in the cost vector, so the three
   axes are not yet reported together by one instrument. That — not "no counting exists" —
   is the real gap.
2. **Astra's unit caution still stands and is not weakened.** Counting erasures gives a
   complexity class, not joules. `kT ln 2` converts only under a stated temperature and an
   idealisation nobody here has argued for.
3. **"Decorrelated" is the right word and "independent" would not be.** The axes trade off
   — Bennett's construction buys reversibility *with space*. They are not orthogonal; they
   are not the same axis either.

**Register, restated after the correction above.** Landauer and Bennett are established.
Zeta *does* count erasures — `garbageBitCount` at the bit level, `Heat.fs` at the shed
boundary, with the Landauer bridge written up in May and labelled PROVEN / CONJECTURED /
SPECULATIVE at the time. What remains `toy` is narrower and should be stated narrowly:
**that Zeta's *reconciliation obligations* have a heat complexity worth reporting beside
time and space.** Naming the axis does not measure that — the same warning Astra attached
to `Φ` — and the cheapest honest first step is the error-message count above, which needs
no new theory.

- `src/Core/Heat.fs` — deferred vs annihilated; the backpressure composition law
- `src/Core.TypeScript/algebra/cost-counter.ts` — `{time, space}` as separate declared dimensions
- `src/Core/Decorrelation.fs` · `src/Core.TypeScript/federated-identity/verdict-vault.ts`
- **Anchors (Beacon):** Tarjan, *Amortized Computational Complexity* (1985) — the potential
  method; Hellerstein & Alvaro, **CALM** — consistency as logical monotonicity;
  Bailis et al., **invariant confluence**; Lamport/Castro–Liskov for the BFT axis;
  Bennett / Landauer on reversible computation and why there is no fixed per-step heat cost
