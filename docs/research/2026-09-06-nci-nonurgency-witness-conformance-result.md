# NciNonUrgency Finite Witness-Conformance Result

**Status:** Measured finite conformance result.  
**Date:** 2026-09-06.  
**Result:** The pinned `NciNonUrgency` TLC experiment completed with its expected
valid verdict, exit code `0`, and `512` exhaustive distinct states. The
TypeScript and independently authored Python wrappers emitted the same canonical
920-byte witness receipt.

> This result concerns exactly one bounded, fairness-conditioned TLA+ model. It
> is **not** an NCI floor, production safety theorem, policy score, consent
> record, consensus result, or authority grant.

The model uses exactly the configuration `Travelers = {ta, tb, tc}`,
`EventBudget = 1`, `AllowForce = FALSE`, and `TrustUrgency = FALSE`. Its
fairness assumptions remain a condition of the result. The observed scope is
therefore accurately described by the receipt label
`bounded-three-traveler-event-budget-one-fairness-conditioned`.

## 2. Cross-surface replay

The TypeScript wrapper admits the raw model, configuration, registry, and jar
bytes; invokes the existing registry-owned TLC command; and emits a canonical
receipt only after that command succeeds. The Python wrapper separately parses
the pinned registry, independently builds the direct Java invocation, checks the
banner, exit code, completion marker, and final state count, and emits the same
receipt layout. The two committed result artifacts are byte-identical.

This is a useful boundary check but **not independent checker diversity**. Both
paths rely on the same committed TLC jar, model, configuration, and registered
state-count expectation. It detects wrapper, invocation, serialization, and
admission drift; it cannot independently establish the soundness of TLC or the
model's interpretation. An alternative checker would require a new contract,
separate expected-result reconciliation, and a distinct fault model.

## 3. Observed faults

The conformance suites exercised the following named failures rather than
assuming them away.

| Mutation or fault                                                                      | Observed disposition                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| One appended model byte                                                                | `refuse-identity-mismatch` before a receipt is rendered                 |
| Changed configuration byte                                                             | `refuse-identity-mismatch` before a receipt is rendered                 |
| Changed jar byte                                                                       | `refuse-identity-mismatch` before a receipt is rendered                 |
| Changed registry worker count                                                          | `refuse-identity-mismatch` before a receipt is rendered                 |
| Reordered or incomplete valid JSON receipt                                             | `refuse-receipt-mismatch`                                               |
| Changed receipt state count from `512` to `511`                                        | `refuse-receipt-mismatch`                                               |
| Replaced `AllowForce = FALSE` with `AllowForce = TRUE` in a temporary independent copy | TLC exit `12`, `Invariant NoCoercion is violated`                       |
| JVM that does not start                                                                | `defer-checker-did-not-run`, distinct from toolchain drift or a verdict |
| Attempt to interpret receipt fields as a score or authority                            | Rejected by schema: no such fields or integration path exist            |

The final row is intentionally structural rather than moral. A field absence
does not prevent an external caller from making an unsupported claim, but the
verifier's typed receipt and contract provide no value that could be confused
with a policy ranking, authority token, or consent decision.

## 4. Current capabilities and retained limits

The repository can now attach a replayable formal-witness observation to a
caller-owned `nci-preservation` basis only when all pinned inputs and the finite
verdict agree. The current policy-admissibility module does not automatically
consume this result; a later integration would need its own narrow contract and
must preserve the `no policy selection effect` rule.

`recorded-consensus` still resolves to `defer-basis-not-implemented`. Existing
attestation checks establish only the stated bound/unbound provenance verdicts,
and existing consensus helpers are not immutable consent records. This work adds
neither a voter roster, a threshold, a decision rule, an expiry model, nor an
authority grant.

## 5. Reproduction

The committed artifacts are
`docs/research/data/2026-09-06-nci-witness-v1-typescript.json` and
`docs/research/data/2026-09-06-nci-witness-v1-python.json`. Each must be
verified as exact bytes; generic formatting is intentionally excluded for this
reason.

```text
mise exec -- bun src/Core.TypeScript/formal-verification/nci-witness-receipt.ts
PYTHONPATH=src/Core.Python/src src/Core.Python/.venv/bin/python \
  -m zeta.nci_witness_receipt_oracle
```

These are checker executions, not a policy-evaluation loop. Any enclosing
bounded tick must remain an attributed execution envelope and must not alter the
recorded TLC invocation or turn a deferred/incomplete checker run into a
success.
