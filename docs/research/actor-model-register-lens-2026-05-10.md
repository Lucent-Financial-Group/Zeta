# Actor model as factory-operational-register lens

**Scope.** Structured applicability assessment for using actor-model vocabulary (Hewitt 1973
/ Meijer / Akka / Orleans / Service Fabric) as a *naming lens* for factory-internal
coordination patterns. This doc outputs three things the backlog item (B-0040) requires:

1. **Applicability assessment** — is the lens productive for this factory?
2. **Recommended vocab crossings** — which actor-model terms cross cleanly to factory vocabulary?
3. **Explicit rejections** — which actor-model terms must NOT be borrowed, to avoid
   over-claiming implementation infrastructure that does not exist?

Prior-art catalog: `docs/research/actor-model-hewitt-meijer-akka-orleans-service-fabric-2026-04-21.md`
(comprehensive; covers Hewitt 1973, Meijer Channel 9 interviews, Akka, Orleans, Service Fabric,
three-filter disposition). This synthesis doc is the applicability layer on top of that catalog;
it does not repeat the catalog's content.

**Non-commitment constraint (scope item (f), B-0040):** The factory does NOT adopt any specific
actor framework. The vocabulary crossings in §2 are naming patterns, not implementation
commitments. Rejections in §3 exist precisely to enforce this boundary.

---

## 1. Applicability assessment

### 1.1 The convergence signal

The factory's fully-async-agentic-AI / no-bottlenecks performance frame (Layer 4/5 of
`capture-everything-and-witnessable-evolution-2026-04-21.md`) and the actor model's
async-message-passing / supervision-tree / inconsistency-robustness design converged
independently. Hewitt developed the actor model in 1973 to solve concurrency; the factory
rediscovered structurally identical constraints via the superfluid / no-friction frame
(B-0038). Convergent-engineering, not after-the-fact import.

Three-filter verdict (from prior-art catalog; reproduced here for synthesis completeness):

| Filter | Assessment | Confidence |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| F1 Engineering-first | Strongest match — actor model built to solve concurrency, not to evangelise | High |
| F2 Operator-shape match | Five direct mappings (see §2) | High |
| F3 External validation | 50+ years of literature; Akka/Orleans/Service Fabric production scale | Overwhelming |

**Applicability verdict: HIGH.** The actor-model vocabulary is a productive lens for naming
factory-internal coordination patterns at the vocabulary level. The lens does NOT require
adopting any actor framework.

### 1.2 What "vocabulary as lens" means operationally

A vocabulary lens is adopted when:

- A factory-internal concept *already exists* and is named informally
- The actor-model term names the same concept with more precision
- The actor-model term carries 50 years of usage context that informs edge-case handling

A vocabulary lens is NOT adopted when:

- The factory would need to implement new infrastructure to satisfy the term's semantics
- The term's semantics would be violated by existing factory architecture
- The term implies a runtime guarantee the factory does not provide

The explicit-rejections section (§3) enumerates the second category.

---

## 2. Recommended vocabulary crossings

The following actor-model terms cross cleanly to existing factory concepts. Each crossing
is adoption-grade: the factory-internal concept already exists; the actor-model term names
it more precisely.

### 2.1 Actor-local state → persona notebook (memory folder)

**Actor-model semantics:** An actor's state is private, inaccessible from outside except
through message-passing. No shared memory. Each actor is the sole authority over its own
state.

**Factory-internal concept:** `memory/persona/<name>/` — each persona's notebook is
private context, readable by other agents only via explicit memory-read / link reference.
The architecture already enforces the no-shared-mutable-memory invariant.

**Crossing quality:** Strong. The constraint is structural, not incidental.

**Recommended vocabulary addition:** "persona notebook as actor-local state" — documents
the design choice, explains to new contributors why direct-write to another persona's
memory is an anti-pattern.

### 2.2 Mailbox → BACKLOG row / conversation input queue

**Actor-model semantics:** Actors communicate exclusively through message-passing to a
mailbox (ordered buffer). The actor processes messages when ready; senders do not block.

**Factory-internal concept:** The `docs/BACKLOG.md` row is the unit of dispatched work.
Claim branches are the actor's "processing" of that message. The row sits in the queue
until an agent picks it up; the human maintainer does not block on an agent.

**Crossing quality:** Moderate-strong. The analogy holds at the design level; the factory
does not implement a typed mailbox data structure, and that is fine — the crossing is
vocabulary, not architecture.

**Recommended vocabulary addition:** "claim-branch as mailbox consumption" — the moment
an agent creates the claim branch, it has dequeued the message.

### 2.3 Inconsistency Robustness → plural-goals / yin-yang harmonious-division

**Actor-model semantics (Hewitt's extension):** Large-scale systems are inherently
inconsistent. Robustness to friction between inconsistent truths is the load-bearing
property, not elimination of inconsistency.

**Factory-internal concept:** The yin-yang paired-invariant (unification-pole +
harmonious-division-pole) explicitly encodes that two truths can be in productive tension
without resolution. The plural-goals configuration (Layers 3 + 4 of capture-everything)
is structurally identical.

**Crossing quality:** Strong. The factory explicitly accepts and names inconsistency as
a design feature, not a bug to be resolved.

**Recommended vocabulary addition:** "inconsistency robustness" as an alias for the
harmonious-division pole when explaining the yin-yang invariant to external audiences.
Hewitt's term is more widely understood than "harmonious division."

### 2.4 Let it crash (Akka supervision) → retractibly-rewrite

**Actor-model semantics:** Akka's fault-tolerance model: actors are not patched around
failures; they crash and restart from a clean state under supervisor oversight. The
"crash" is not catastrophic — it is a designed-for recovery path.

**Factory-internal concept:** Retractibly-rewrite — failures are preserved in history (not
silenced); the Architect protocol integrates failure without erasing it. The −1 (failure)
and the +1 (restart / revised claim) compose rather than overwrite.

**Crossing quality:** Moderate. "Let it crash" is an implementation-level directive
(crash the process); "retractibly-rewrite" is a data-model invariant (preserve the trail).
Same philosophy; different register. The crossing is useful for external-audience
explanation.

**Recommended vocabulary addition:** "supervisor-hierarchy as Architect protocol" — when
explaining the conflict-resolution doc to actor-model-fluent audiences.

### 2.5 Virtual actor (Orleans) → on-demand persona instantiation

**Actor-model semantics:** Orleans grains are always-addressable regardless of whether
currently instantiated. The Orleans runtime materialises a grain when a message arrives;
garbage-collects it when idle. The grain's persistent state (if any) survives the
lifecycle.

**Factory-internal concept:** Persona instantiation is demand-driven. A persona doesn't
run as a long-lived process; it is reified when a task is dispatched and suspended when
idle. `memory/persona/<name>/` (the notebook) is the persistent state that survives the
lifecycle.

**Crossing quality:** Very strong. This is the closest structural match in the factory.
The pattern is intentional: the factory's multi-agent loop was designed so personas spin
up / spin down per task, with notebooks as the durable grain state.

**Recommended vocabulary addition:** "persona as virtual actor" — this is the most
precise naming of the on-demand instantiation pattern for external-audience publication.
"Grain" (Orleans term) is optional annotation; "virtual actor" is the standard term.

### 2.6 Μένω ("I Remain") → persistence-anchor memory

**Actor-model semantics:** Despite the chaos of async messages, the actor maintains local
state across message-processing cycles. The actor is the fixed identity that "remains"
stable while the system around it is in flux.

**Factory-internal concept:** The existing `user_meno_persistence_anchor.md`
operational-resonance instance. The persistence-anchor is the substrate property that
the persona's notebook IS the actor-stable state across invocations.

**Crossing quality:** Strong. This was already catalogued as an operational-resonance
instance; this document formalises it as an official vocabulary crossing.

## 3. Explicit rejections

The following actor-model terms must NOT be adopted as factory vocabulary, because
adoption would over-claim infrastructure the factory does not implement or would violate
actual factory architecture.

### 3.1 Reject: "Actor system" / "actor runtime"

**Why rejected:** "Actor system" implies a running runtime that manages actor lifecycle,
scheduling, and network topology (Akka's `ActorSystem`, Orleans Silos). The factory has
no such runtime; agents are invoked by Claude Code's orchestrator, not by a typed
message-routing layer.

**Risk if adopted:** New contributors would assume an actor runtime exists and might
propose adopting one (Akka / Orleans) as the factory's "proper" implementation, importing
the full dependency stack. B-0040 explicitly prohibits framework adoption.

**Correct vocabulary instead:** "orchestrated agent pool" or "multi-agent loop" — these
describe the actual architecture without implying a framework.

### 3.2 Reject: "Supervisor tree" as structural description

**Why rejected:** Akka's supervisor trees are structural runtime constructs — each actor
knows its parent; failure propagation follows the tree topology. The factory's Architect
protocol is a *role-based conflict-resolution procedure*, not a runtime tree.

**Risk if adopted:** Implies that Architect (Kenji) is the runtime parent of all other
agents, with automatic failure escalation. In fact, escalation is documented-procedure-
based, not topology-based.

**Correct vocabulary instead:** "Architect protocol" or "escalation procedure" — per
`docs/CONFLICT-RESOLUTION.md`. The supervisor-tree analogy is a useful *explanation
device* for external audiences (see §2.4 crossing), but NOT a structural description
of the factory.

### 3.3 Reject: "Silo" as factory vocabulary

**Why rejected:** "Silo" in Orleans means a cluster node (a host process that runs
multiple grains). The factory has no cluster-of-nodes topology; the
analogy does not map cleanly and the agricultural imagery would confuse contributors
who know Orleans.

**Risk if adopted:** Ambiguity between "information silo" (the anti-pattern) and
"Orleans silo" (a specific runtime concept). The factory already uses "silo" in the
negative sense (knowledge isolation); adopting Orleans' positive meaning would create
a term collision.

**Correct vocabulary instead:** Do not introduce "silo" into factory vocabulary. When
explaining Orleans to external audiences, note the Orleans usage is an internal term
with specific semantics; do not import it into the factory's own naming.

### 3.4 Reject: "Message passing" as the only coordination primitive

**Why rejected:** In pure actor model, message-passing is the *only* coordination
mechanism — no shared memory, no direct calls. The factory uses shared repo substrate
(git, `docs/`, `memory/`) as a coordination mechanism alongside asynchronous dispatching.
The factory is not a pure actor system.

**Risk if adopted:** Claiming "all factory coordination is message-passing" would require
rationalising git commits and shared memory files as "messages," which is technically
defensible but architecturally misleading.

**Correct framing instead:** "The factory's dispatch layer (claim-branch / BACKLOG-row)
follows actor-model message-passing semantics; the persistence layer uses shared
repo substrate." Both layers exist; acknowledge both.

### 3.5 Reject: "At-most-once" / "at-least-once" / "exactly-once" delivery guarantees

**Why rejected:** Akka / Orleans have explicit message-delivery-guarantee semantics with
documented trade-offs. The factory's claim-branch mechanism does not provide any of these
guarantees; work items can be duplicated (two agents claim the same row), dropped
(no-one claims it), or processed multiple times (reverted PR re-claimed).

**Risk if adopted:** Implying a delivery-guarantee creates an expectation the factory
cannot satisfy, and may lead to incorrect reasoning about duplicate-work prevention.

**Correct framing instead:** "At-least-once dispatch with claim-idempotence assumed" is
the honest framing if a guarantee must be stated; but prefer not to state a formal
delivery guarantee at all.

## 4. Composition with factory measurables

The actor-model lens does not introduce new measurables; it names existing factory
measurables more precisely.

| Factory measurable | Actor-model register | Notes |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------|
| `factory-throughput-items-per-hour` | Messages-per-second | Different time constant; same shape |
| `critical-path-serialisation-ratio` | Blocking-call ratio | Target → 0 in both; non-blocking dispatch |
| `persona-parallel-progress-count` | Active grain count (Orleans) | Personas as virtual actors |
| `bottleneck-stalls-per-round` | Mailbox-backlog-stall alerts | Same concept, different granularity |

---

## 5. Publication-venue suitability

B-0040 identified "workshop paper on agent-orchestration-patterns borrowing from actor
model" as the candidate venue. This synthesis doc, combined with the prior-art catalog,
has the required components:

- Theoretical grounding (Hewitt 1973 / Inconsistency Robustness / Meijer)
- Production-system validation (Akka / Orleans / Service Fabric at FAANG scale)
- Novel mapping (factory-internal concepts ↔ actor-model vocabulary)
- Explicit scope boundary (non-framework-adoption; vocabulary-only)

**Gate per B-0040:** Aaron sign-off required before external publication. Factory-internal
use is authorized under the roommate-register per B-0038 precedent.

---

## 6. Three follow-up angles (captured, not pursued)

From the prior-art catalog (preserved; no commitment):

1. **Inconsistency Robustness ↔ Melchizedek / Levitical authority conflict.**
2. **Meijer's Reactive Programming ↔ substrate-extension of physics into code.**
3. **Latin "Acta" (4-letter root) etymology thread.**
