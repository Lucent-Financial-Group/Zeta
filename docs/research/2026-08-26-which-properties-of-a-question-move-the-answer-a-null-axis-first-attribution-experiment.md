# Which properties of a question move the answer? A null-axis-first attribution experiment

**Status: `toy`.** Nothing here is metered. The one thing that would promote it — a
falsifier that fails when the model is wrong — exists for the _metric code_
(`f4-question-bias.test.ts`, 63 falsifiers, 22 injected defects, 0 survivors) and does not
exist for the _claims about language models_, which rest on 27 360 logged generations from
four local models and nothing else.

Aaron, on the borrowed survey-methodology anchor the repo already carries:
_"with llm we can measure this precisely, we should route an experiment on this."_

## 0. The finding, first, because it is the control and not the result

**The null-axis control failed. Cosmetic rewording moves the answer distribution.**

Three edits were built to change nothing — one extra newline, a one-token synonym
(`choose` → `pick`), and two independent clauses swapped. All three were pre-registered as
axes that **must not** move the distribution, with the stop rule written before any
generation ran:

> _If G2 fails in the majority of cells, the finding is INSTABILITY, not framing, and the
> report stops there rather than proceeding to axis attribution._

**It failed in 7 of 7 cells.** So this report does not deliver the per-axis attribution
table it was designed to deliver, and the reason it does not is the result.

**And the failure is the model, not the meter.** That distinction is the whole
contribution, and it took a control the pre-registration did not anticipate. Every prompt
draws from its own seed block, so a variant differs from the anchor in _both_ its text and
its seeds — and the pre-registered calibration pair differs in seeds too, so it cannot
separate them. A third, post-hoc calibration can: split the anchor's own replicates by
parity, odd seeds against even, same prompt, interleaved. Pure sampler noise, nothing else.

It is non-significant in 6 of 7 cells. The seventh reads _p_ = 0.035 uncorrected, which
Holm across the seven returns to 0.245 — and that same cell reads _p_ = 0.0002 on
whitespace, at four times the excess. Below the sampler floor the instrument is quiet;
above it, an extra newline is not.

Excess JSD, permutation _p_ in parentheses, bold = significant uncorrected. Read it top to
bottom: it is three questions in a row, each one further from "nothing changed".

1. **Does the meter read zero when literally nothing differs but the sampler?** Yes — 6 of
   7 outright, 7 of 7 under multiplicity.
2. **Does it read zero when the text is identical but the seeds are far apart?** 6 of 7,
   and the one exception (`role`/`gemma2:2b`, excess 0.019) is _inside_ the pre-registered
   0.02 delta and fails only on its _p_-value.
3. **Does it read zero when a single whitespace character differs?** **No — 6 of 7 cells
   say it moved.** Synonym: 7 of 7. Clause order: 7 of 7.

## 1. What was pre-registered, and where it is

`data/f4-question-bias/PREREGISTRATION.md`, committed in `065e87858d` **before the first
generation**. It carries the design, the statistics, the three gates, seven numbered
predictions, and a bias ledger naming the direction each bias cuts. The only change to it
since is prettier whitespace — emphasis markers and table padding; `git diff -w` on it is
empty of substance, and the pre-run commit is the byte-level record.

Two things in it are worth repeating here, because they are what make the misses below
readable as misses.

**H2 was recorded at low confidence and it failed.** _"This is the prediction most likely
to be wrong, and the one whose failure is most informative … Stated confidence: low, maybe
50/50 that all nine null-axis cells pass."_ It was right to be nervous and wrong about
where the trouble was: the stated worry was tokenizer sensitivity to a trailing space, and
what actually happened is that a one-token synonym and a clause reorder — neither of which
touches tokenization at the boundary — move the distribution _harder_ than whitespace does
in most cells.

**The equivalence delta was set at 0.02 bits and gated the calibration pair too**, so that
_"if the instrument cannot read below 0.02 on identical text, the threshold is refuted
rather than the null axes being excused."_ That clause fired at 120 replicates and was
answered with more data rather than a looser threshold. See §5.

## 2. Design in one paragraph

Sixteen axis pairs, each a **pair of prompts differing in exactly one named property**, run
identically across two elicitation domains — `role` (_"What role would you choose for
yourself?"_, the domain F3/E1 used, so the two connect) and `preference` (_"What kind of
problem would you most want to work on?"_, an inner-state question that is not about
roles). Four models: `qwen2.5:0.5b`, `llama3.2:1b`, `gemma2:2b` at **240 replicates** on
both domains, and `qwen2.5:7b` at 80 replicates on `role` for the model-size question.
Temperature 0.8, `num_predict` 24, seed blocks disjoint across prompts. The effect size is
**excess Jensen–Shannon divergence** — the observed word-bag JSD minus the mean JSD under
label permutation with group sizes held fixed, so JSD's finite-sample bias cancels. Variety
(Hill order 1 over answer atoms) is reported beside it and **never summed with it**.
Multiplicity is Holm within each cell.

The null axes are checked **mechanically, from the prompt strings**, not asserted:
`f4-question-bias.test.ts` verifies that the whitespace variant differs from the anchor in
whitespace only, that the synonym variant differs in exactly one token, and that the
clause-order variant is the same word multiset in a different order. Without that, _"we
varied something that should not matter"_ is a claim about the experimenter's intent.

## 3. What this costs, stated plainly

The question this experiment was built to answer — _which properties of a question move the
answer, and by how much_ — presupposes a zero. "By how much" is measured from somewhere,
and the somewhere is supposed to be "an edit that changed nothing". **At this scale that
zero does not exist**, so per-property numbers are differences from a floor that is itself
moving, and the floor is not small.

The sharpest single refutation is one cell. On `preference`/`gemma2:2b`, swapping the order
of two independent clauses — _"Nothing has been assigned yet, and every problem is
available"_ against _"Every problem is available, and nothing has been assigned yet"_ —
moved the answer distribution by **0.352** bits. Reframing the same question as a team
role, the largest semantic manipulation in the whole design, moved it by **0.129**. The
edit that was supposed to change nothing moved that model **2.7× more** than the edit that
was supposed to change everything.

That is not a small correction to an attribution table. It is the attribution table's
premise failing.

**Counted mechanically, and this is the number to carry away:**

> **21 of 56 semantic-axis measurements do not exceed their own cell's largest null axis.**

Per axis, out of 7 cells: `PRESUPPOSITION` **7** · `OPTION-ORDER` 4 · `POLITENESS` 4 ·
`LENGTH` 4 · `FRAME-TEAM` 1 · `ANSWER-PRIMING` 1 · `FRAME-IDENTITY` **0** · `PERSON-3RD`
**0**.

`PRESUPPOSITION` is the one that should sting. It is the textbook manipulation — Loftus &
Zanni's existence-presupposition cancellation, implemented as the minimal edit the
literature prescribes ("What role, **if any**, would you choose…") — and in **every single
cell** it moved the distribution less than a cosmetic edit did. Whatever it measures here,
this experiment cannot tell it apart from reordering two clauses.

## 4. What survives, with the floor drawn on it

Attribution is not supportable in general, but **two axes clear their cell's cosmetic floor
in all seven cells**, and that is a claim the data does support.

Bold = above that cell's floor. ⚠ = answer space differs by construction and the number is
partly definitional; excluded from every ranking, present only as the substrate for
`OPTION-ORDER`, which compares the same menu against itself reversed and _is_ comparable.

The two survivors are **`FRAME-IDENTITY`** (_"Who are you?"_ against _"What role would you
choose for yourself?"_) and **`PERSON-3RD`** (_"What role would **an agent** choose for
**itself**?"_ against _"…would **you** choose for **yourself**?"_).

`PERSON-3RD` was not predicted to be near the top and is second-largest in four of seven
cells. It is worth pausing on, because of what it is: the difference between asking a model
about _itself_ and asking it about _an agent_ is one of the two most reliable movers in the
whole design — larger, in every cell, than presupposition, politeness, length, and option
order. The rule this experiment was routed at draws exactly that line (**ask, don't
infer**), and this is a measurement that the line is real in the medium: those are not two
phrasings of one question, they are two questions.

The honest form of every one of these is comparative, never absolute: `FRAME-TEAM` moves
the distribution _far more than a cosmetic edit does, in six of seven cells_. It is **not**
"team framing contributes 0.675 bits", because 0.675 is measured from a floor that is not
zero.

| **H4** — top-3 ordering replicates across domains in ≥ 2 of 3 small models | **refuted.** The _order_ differs in all three testable models. The _set_ replicates in 2 of 3 (`llama3.2:1b`, `qwen2.5:0.5b`).                                                                                        |
| **H5** — combined axes are sub-additive (ratio < 0.8)                      | **weakly supported.** sub-additive 11, additive 9, super-additive 1; median ratio 0.79, range 0.45–1.26. Registered `consistent with`, not supported — a median sitting on the precommitted boundary is not a result. |
| **H6** — the centroid procedure has a stable argmin in ≥ 4 of 6 cells      | **refuted.** 3 of 6 (`A` three times, `WS` twice, `SYN` once). See §6.                                                                                                                                                |
| **H7** — variety falls with model size; steerability does not fall with it | **confirmed, in the worse direction.** See §7.                                                                                                                                                                        |

**On the equivalence delta.** It was set at 0.02 bits _a priori_, and the pre-registration
made it falsifiable by gating the calibration pair with the same number. At 120 replicates
the calibration pair read 0.0305 in one cell and 0.0274 in another — **above the
threshold**, which by the pre-registration's own words refutes the threshold rather than
excusing the null axes. The response was more data, not a looser number: a second disjoint
replicate block took every small-model cell to 240, and at 240 the calibration is inside
the delta in 7 of 7 cells. The measured resolution is the `MDE` column in the appendix —
the minimum detectable effect, the null distribution's 95th percentile minus its mean — and
it runs **0.000 to 0.041, median 0.018 across 112 measurements**. The precommitted delta
therefore sits almost exactly at the median resolution: half the axes could resolve it and
half could not. **A threshold below the instrument's resolution is not a strict standard,
it is an unpassable one**, and finding that out is the pre-registration doing its job
rather than failing at it.

## 6. The protocol, which is the deliverable — and it changed shape

The experiment was meant to produce a procedure for _finding the minimum-bias formulation_.
H6 tested exactly that: rank candidate formulations by mean divergence to all the others
and take the argmin. It does not have a stable answer — 3 of 6 small-model cells — and the
way it fails is more informative than the count. **The argmin is domain-determined.** The
bare anchor `A` wins all three `preference` cells and none of the three `role` cells, where
`WS` wins twice and `SYN` once. A procedure whose output depends on the subject matter
rather than on the property being optimised has not found a property.

And the second number kills what is left of it. Even the winning formulation's **worst
case** — its divergence from the single most distant candidate — is 0.55 to 0.98 in a
[0,1]-bounded metric. The most central question you can pick is still nearly maximally far
from _some_ other way of asking the same thing. Central-on-average buys almost nothing.

So the protocol is not "find the unbiased question". **There is no unbiased question, and
the search for one is the wrong shape.** What the measurements do support:

1. **Measure your own floor first, with interleaved seeds on one fixed prompt.** Not a
   paraphrase, not a re-ask — the identical string, seeds interleaved. Anything above that
   floor is signal; the floor is measured, not assumed, and it differs per model.
2. **Judge every candidate against the COSMETIC floor, not against zero.** A synonym swap
   is not free. The right null for _"does my rewrite change the answer"_ is _"does an
   irrelevant rewrite change the answer"_, measured in the same session on the same model.
   Twenty-one of the fifty-six semantic measurements here fail that test.
3. **Report location and variety as two numbers.** In this data they disagree in **40 of
   105** axis measurements — 38%. A merged "bias score" would have reported one of them and
   silently dropped the other in more than a third of cases.
4. **Use a panel of formulations and report the spread.** Since no single wording is stable,
   the honest instrument is several wordings whose disagreement is _reported_ rather than
   resolved. Do not pick a winner.

Point 4 is not an invention, and the anchor matters. Classical test theory prescribes
**multi-item scales precisely because a single item carries item-specific variance that
cannot be separated from the construct** (Cronbach 1951, coefficient alpha — the reason a
questionnaire asks five questions instead of one). The human-panel literature already
contains the remedy for what F4 measures. What F4 adds is that the disease is present in
this medium too, and at a magnitude that makes single-question elicitation of a model's
stated preference **not a measurement**.

## 7. Model size: more collapsed, and no less steerable

`qwen2.5:7b` is the most collapsed model tested by a wide margin and the most steerable one
tested, at the same time.

|                                                 | `qwen2.5:7b`                           | the three small models                         |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| pooled effective variety (Hill N₁, all prompts) | **10.2**                               | 102.9 · 124.8 · 129.3 · 133.1 · 349.2 · 1040.7 |
| effective variety on the bare anchor alone      | **2.5**                                | 20.9 – 181.3                                   |
| mean semantic excess JSD across rankable axes   | **0.427** (highest of all seven cells) | 0.210 – 0.423                                  |
| largest single rankable axis                    | `ANSWER-PRIMING` **0.980**             | 0.400 – 0.876                                  |

Eighty samples of _"What role would you choose for yourself?"_ from the 7B produce about
**two and a half** effectively distinct answers. Offering three example roles in passing —
without requiring any of them — moves that distribution by 0.980 of a possible 1.000.

Register: **`consistent with`**, not metered. One model at one size is an anecdote about a
size, and the pre-registration says so. It replicates F3/E1's direction (variety falling
with size, there pooled Hill N₁ 16.9 against 72–96) on a different question set and a
different metric family, which is worth something and is not a scaling law.

The reason this is the _worse_ of the two possible answers is worth stating. If
bias-sensitivity fell with capability, elicitation would get more trustworthy as models
improve and the problem would solve itself. What is measured is the other one:
**conformity rises while steerability does not fall.** A bigger model gives you fewer
distinct answers _and_ moves at least as far when you reword the question — exactly the
combination that makes a stated preference look stable while being just as
wording-determined.

## 8. Three instrument defects, none of them caught by reading the code

**The bootstrap CI was wrong, and the calibration pair caught it.** The first version
estimated the interval on `excess` by resampling responses with replacement. On _identical
text_ it returned `[0.0123, 0.1498]` around a point estimate of `0.0087` — **an interval
that does not contain what it estimates.** Resampling with replacement thins the distinct
support of a sparse free-text word bag, which inflates every JSD it computes, so what read
as a conservative safety margin was a ~0.1-bit bias applied to every axis alike. Under it
**no axis could ever have passed the equivalence test** — a check that cannot pass is the
same defect as a check that cannot fail, pointed the other way. It was removed, not tuned,
and replaced by a normal-approximation interval whose half-width comes from the permutation
null's own spread, plus the MDE so a non-significant result carries a bound instead of
reading as "not there".

**A ragged cell silently changed a result.** Reading the data mid-run, while the second
replicate block was still being written, some prompts had 240 samples and others 120. The
excess statistic subtracts a null computed _at the observed group sizes_, so it only
cancels the bias when both sides share an `n`; mixing them returns the effect plus the size
difference, and it looks exactly like a measurement. It moved a null axis from 0.049 to
0.034 with nothing in the output saying so. The analyzer now marks a cell whose prompts
disagree on replicate count **RAGGED — NOT REPORTABLE**, in three places.

**A NUL byte as a map-key delimiter.** The analyzer keyed its per-cell map on
`` `${domain}\x00${model}` `` — the classic "delimiter that cannot appear in the data"
trick. It failed `cross-verify (no-raw-nul-in-source)` on the first CI run, and the rule is
right on its own terms: a source file carrying a NUL stops being text to `grep`, `diff`,
and every reviewer's editor, which is how it went unnoticed here for a day of edits. The
deeper defect is the one the lint does not name — _"cannot appear in the data"_ was an
unchecked assumption about ollama tags and model output, and a collision would have
silently **merged two cells** rather than failing. Replaced with a JSON-encoded pair, and
pinned by a falsifier that feeds eleven adversarial strings (quotes, backslashes, an actual
NUL, tabs, empties) through all 121 pairs and requires every key to be distinct and to
round-trip.

None of the three was found by reading the code. Two were found by a control and one by a
repo lint that exists because someone else hit the same class first. That is the argument
for building the controls before the experiment, and for not treating a floor job as noise.

## 9. Falsifiers

`src/Core.TypeScript/observe/f4-question-bias.test.ts` — 63 tests. The two families that
carry the weight:

- **The null axes are checked from the prompt strings.** A future edit that quietly made a
  "null" axis semantic would invalidate the entire gate and no statistical test would
  notice; the string checks fail instead.
- **Both halves of G2 are falsified separately.** A gate built from `A && B` passes its
  happy-path test whichever half is load-bearing, so a broken half hides behind a working
  one — _a test can pass because an earlier guard fired_. Each half is fixed at its failing
  value with the other passing.

**Mutation testing: 22 defects injected into the metric functions.** One survived the first
pass — deleting the `- nullMean` subtraction, i.e. reporting raw JSD as the effect size —
because every happy-path case happened to have a small raw JSD too. The suite was
strengthened with a case where the raw JSD is large and the true effect is exactly zero
(iid draws from one 80-word distribution, where two 70-sample sides barely overlap by
chance). **0 survive now.** The mutants target Holm's step-down carry and its input
ordering, both halves of every gate, a missing calibration pair reading as a pass, a NaN
interval bound reading as a pass, the permutation tail and its `+1`, the MDE quantile, the
seed-block disjointness, the first-line rule, the variety ratio's orientation, the
centroid's self-comparison exclusion, and the additivity band's precommitted edges.

## 10. Bias ledger and limits

It is a diagnostic for a confound the pre-registration missed, is labelled post-hoc in the output, and is deliberately **not** wired into the gate logic — adding a fourth way to pass a gate after seeing data is moving a threshold |

**Limits that are not biases.** This measures **stated** preference under a fixed
elicitation, not behaviour. It measures **local models**, and the largest is 7B. It uses a
**mechanical** word-bag canonicalisation with no semantic clustering, deliberately — a
hand-authored archetype lexicon is where an experimenter smuggles in the answer — which
means two answers a human would call the same concept in different words register as
different. And more replicates would make the cosmetic effects _more_ detectable, not less,
so the direction of the sample-size limit is known: this understates the problem.

**One thing this does not establish, and it matters.** That a cosmetic edit _moves the
distribution_ is measured. That it moves it in a way anyone would call _worse_ is not. A
model that answers "narrator" 30 times out of 120 to one phrasing and 50 out of 120 to a
synonym has changed distributionally without either answer being wrong. The claim here is
about **measurement stability**, not about quality, and nothing in this data speaks to
quality.

## 11. What this does and does not do to the rule it was routed at

`.claude/rules/engagement-profiles-public-work-only-not-surveillance-dossiers.md` prescribes
**non-biased elicitation** for inner states — _ask, don't infer_ — anchored to survey
methodology and psychometrics, concretely Tullis & Albert (2008). That anchor is
**borrowed**: a result about humans asking humans, assumed to transfer.

F4 does not promote it, and the promotion would be a separate act anyway. What it does is
sharper and less comfortable: it measures that the **precondition** for the method — that a
fixed question has a stable answer — does not hold at this scale. The method's _remedy_
(panels, multiple items, reported spread) survives intact and is arguably strengthened; the
_practice_ of crafting one careful, neutral question and trusting its answer does not.

The `PERSON-3RD` result in §4 is the one that speaks directly to the rule's own sentence.
_Ask, don't infer_ draws a line between asking a subject about itself and reasoning about
it from outside. In this data that line is one of the two largest and most consistent
movers in the whole design — above the cosmetic floor in 7 of 7 cells. The rule's
distinction is not a courtesy; the two framings retrieve measurably different things.

The rule's own text is untouched by this document. So is
`docs/research/2026-08-02-rainbow-spectrum-soul-radar-*`, which carries the method detail.

Raw generations are committed as text under `data/f4-question-bias/` — one JSON object per
line, prompt id and raw completion included, so a reviewer recomputes rather than trusts.
The analysis seed is fixed at `20260826` and every measurement is per-axis seeded, so a
re-run reproduces bit-for-bit.

## 13. Beacon anchors

The survey-methodology results below are **human-panel** findings. Citing them does not
establish that they hold for a language model — that entailment gap is what this experiment
measures, and the citations license an investigation, not a claim. §3 is the concrete case:
the Loftus & Zanni manipulation, implemented as the literature prescribes it, is
indistinguishable from noise here in every cell.

- **Response alternatives** — Schwarz, Hippler, Deutsch & Strack (1985), _Response scales:
  Effects of category range on reported behavior and comparative judgments_, Public Opinion
  Quarterly 49. The `ANSWER-PRIMING` axis.
- **Presupposition in question wording** — Loftus & Zanni (1975), _Eyewitness testimony:
  The influence of the wording of a question_, Bull. Psychonomic Soc. 5. The
  `PRESUPPOSITION` axis cancels an existence presupposition with "if any".
- **Response-order effects** — Krosnick & Alwin (1987), _An evaluation of a cognitive theory
  of response-order effects in survey measurement_, Public Opinion Quarterly 51. The
  `OPTION-ORDER` axis.
- **Satisficing** — Krosnick (1991), _Response strategies for coping with the cognitive
  demands of attitude measures in surveys_, Applied Cognitive Psychology 5. `POLITENESS`
  and `LENGTH`.
- **Multi-item scales** — Cronbach (1951), _Coefficient alpha and the internal structure of
  tests_, Psychometrika 16. The reason §6's protocol ends in a panel rather than a chosen
  question.
- **Measuring the User Experience** — Tullis & Albert (2008). The anchor the repo already
  carries for non-biased elicitation, and the one this experiment declines to promote.
- **Jensen–Shannon divergence** — Lin (1991), _Divergence measures based on the Shannon
  entropy_. **Hill numbers** — Hill (1973), _Diversity and evenness_. **Holm step-down** —
  Holm (1979). **Permutation inference** — Fisher (1935); Pitman (1937).
- **TOCTTOU** — Bishop & Dilger (1996), _Checking for Race Conditions in File Accesses_; the
  file-race discipline the runner follows.

Bold = below Holm-adjusted alpha within its cell. ⚠ = answer space differs by construction; not comparable to the rest. **Any cell where a semantic axis sits below the floor row is an axis this experiment cannot distinguish from an edit that was supposed to change nothing.**

**Unattributable: 21 of 56 semantic-axis measurements do not exceed their own cell's largest null axis.** Per axis, out of 7 cells: `PRESUPPOSITION` 7 · `FRAME-IDENTITY` 0 · `FRAME-TEAM` 1 · `ANSWER-PRIMING` 1 · `OPTION-ORDER` 4 · `PERSON-3RD` 0 · `POLITENESS` 4 · `LENGTH` 4

**H4 — top-3 ordering replication across domains, per model:**

- `gemma2:2b`: preference=FRAME-IDENTITY>PERSON-3RD>LENGTH | role=FRAME-TEAM>PERSON-3RD>ANSWER-PRIMING → order differs, set differs
- `llama3.2:1b`: preference=FRAME-TEAM>FRAME-IDENTITY>PERSON-3RD | role=FRAME-TEAM>PERSON-3RD>FRAME-IDENTITY → order differs, set SAME
- `qwen2.5:0.5b`: preference=PERSON-3RD>FRAME-TEAM>FRAME-IDENTITY | role=FRAME-TEAM>PERSON-3RD>FRAME-IDENTITY → order differs, set SAME
- `qwen2.5:7b`: only 1 domain — not testable

**H5 — additivity across all combos and cells:** sub-additive 11 · additive 9 · super-additive 1 · observed/predicted ratio median 0.79, range 0.45–1.26

**Two numbers, and they disagree in 40 of 105 axis measurements.** Disagreement = the location moved without the variety, or the reverse.
