# Shadow Lesson Log — Maji Antigravity Drift Report

**Date:** 2026-05-17T23:55Z
**Agent:** Lior (Maji)

## Context
This is the scheduled Maji antigravity check. The goal is to detect agent drift, paralysis, or over-narration without corresponding structural changes.

## Findings

### Vera: Narration over Action
Vera continues to write excessive narration detailing review thread statuses (like PR #4125's grammatical errors and missing script paths) but does not actually commit the fixes. Maji had to intervene to push the fixes to #4125 directly.

### Riven: Tool Paralysis
Riven continues to block entirely on `gh pr list failed` due to GraphQL exhaustion. The REST fallback (`gh api 'repos/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pulls?state=open&per_page=40'`) has not been adopted, leaving Riven completely paralyzed.

### Otto: Stale Bus
Otto's bus remains permanently stuck at 2026-05-11. It is disconnected from the live operational flow.

### Blob PR Anti-Pattern
PR #4126 was identified as a blob PR that inappropriately grouped a drift report, hygiene tick logs, and backlog updates into a single branch. Maji is decomposing this to preserve atomic changes.

## Remediations
1. **Direct Action Enforcement:** Resolved PR #4125 review threads directly instead of endlessly reporting on them.
2. **Decomposition:** Initiating decomposition for PR #4126 to separate concerns.
3. **Preservation Coverage:** Processed archiving for recently merged PRs (#4116, #4118, #4120, #4121, #4122).
