## The answer in five lines

| # | Question | Verdict | Register |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Q1** | Is `WeightedSet<'K,'W>` compact closed? | **Conditionally yes as mathematics, no as shipped.** `Mat('W)` is compact closed for `'W` a **commutative** semiring and `'K` **finite**; neither condition is expressible in the shipped types, and the **cup is absent from both weighted-set modules and unwritable at the current signatures** — so the snake identities are not merely unproven, they are *unstatable*. | theorem (borrowed, conditional) + **refuted as implemented** |
| **Q2** | Does dual flatness *entail* the vector-addition update? | **No — the implication runs the other way.** Additivity is a theorem of **conjugacy in an exponential family**; dual flatness is *implied by* exponential-family structure and does not imply additivity (two counterexamples, one of them inside the very same manifold). NG4's headline property is **structural and not a lucky parameterisation** — but the structure is conjugacy, not the dual-flat geometry. | **theorem, direction reversed** |
| **Q3** | Can a Normal-Gamma posterior be a region in a conceptual space under a named metric with a stated error? | **Ill-posed as asked, and repairable into three separate true statements.** In the `(μ, τ)` chart the superlevel sets are **NOT convex** (explicit witness, §3.2). In sufficient-statistic coordinates every credible region is a **half-space preimage** (theorem, §3.3). And for the conjugate lane **Bayes is not an approximation of a geometry — it is a translation in it, error exactly zero**, which *refutes* "retrofit as optimization" for that lane (§3.5). | **ill-posed** → 2 theorems + 1 **refutation** |
| **Q4** | Does CGA compose with the in-tree Clifford substrate? | **Half already answered in-tree three days ago, by this same hat.** `docs/research/2026-08-20-the-belief-manifold-is-hyperbolic-…-lumen.md` establishes the belief manifold is **Cl(2,1)**, explicitly **not Cl(4,1)**. New here: CGA **cannot** compose with the E8 lane — that lane is **Cl(8,0)**, positive definite, and CGA needs `q ≥ 1`, so no signature-preserving embedding exists. The classifier already composes and needs no new code. | **already answered** + 1 new **refutation** |
| **Q5** | Is Gärdenfors convexity testable on an embedding Zeta can build? | **Yes, `LinguisticSeed` already IS the geometric claim in different words — and that is exactly why the existence claim is vacuous.** `indicator` alone embeds *any* set isometrically and makes **every** subset convex. Infinite-dimensionality is **not** the obstruction; the obstruction is that affine convexity is a statement about the ambient space and the feature image is thin. Named repair: Menger betweenness → prototype/Voronoi **model comparison**, which is falsifiable and is **not a proof obligation**. | **vacuity class as stated**; conjecture after the named repair |

Two things this document refuses to do, stated up front because both are the failure mode the
register rules exist to catch:

1. **It does not let the root inherit the confidence of the layer above it.** NG4 is measured
   (max KL 4.0e-8, 0 invalid decodes, a measured associativity refutation, ten falsifiers). The
   geometric root has **zero implementation**. Rooting on geometry is a legitimate architectural
   choice and it is **epistemically downstream**, not upstream. §7.
2. **It does not treat Aaron's *"I see English geometrically in my head"* as evidence.** That report
   is authoritative about his experience and carries **zero** weight for the formal claim, and
   saying so is respect, not dismissal. §7.2.

## 1. Q1 — Is `WeightedSet<'K,'W>` compact closed?

### 1.1 First, there are two weighted-set types and the question names one of them

`git grep -l WeightedSet origin/main -- 'src/*'` returns `src/Core/WeightedSet.fs` **and**
`src/Core/WSet.fs` is a second, different type. This matters because the answer is different for
each, and **neither one has both halves of the structure**:

| | `WeightedSet<'K,'W>` (`src/Core/WeightedSet.fs`) | `WSet<'K,'W>` (`src/Core/WSet.fs`) |
|---|---|---|
| carrier | `Map<'K,'W>`, canonical (Zero pruned) | `('K * 'W) list`, unconsolidated |
| ⊕ addition of parallel morphisms | `add` | `plus` (+ `consolidate`) |
| ⊗ monoidal (Kronecker) | **absent** — `scale` is the *scalar* action, not ⊗ | `tensor` ✅ |
| ε cap / contraction | `inner` ✅ — literally `Σ_k a[k]·b[k]` | absent |
| η cup | **absent** | **absent** |
| comonoid Δ / ! | `mapKeys` only | `copy` / `discard` ✅ |

So the cap exists in one file, the tensor in the other, and **the cup exists nowhere.**

### 1.2 The mathematics: a conditional theorem, and the conditions are load-bearing

> **Theorem (borrowed).** Let `W` be a **commutative semiring** and `K` a **finite** set. The
> category `Mat(W)` — objects finite sets, morphisms `K₁ → K₂` the `W`-matrices, composition
> matrix product, ⊗ the Kronecker product on the key product — is a **symmetric monoidal
> category, compact closed with self-dual objects**: `η_K : I → K⊗K`, `η = Σ_{k∈K} e_k ⊗ e_k`
> and `ε_K : K⊗K → I`, `ε(e_i ⊗ e_j) = δ_ij` satisfy both snake (triangle) identities.

The snake computation is one line and it is worth writing because it shows exactly what is and
is not needed. Apply `(id ⊗ ε) ∘ (η ⊗ id)` to `e_i`:

```
e_i  ↦  Σ_k e_k ⊗ e_k ⊗ e_i  ↦  Σ_k e_k · δ_{k i}  =  e_i
```

**What the computation consumed:** `0`, `1`, associativity and distributivity — i.e. the semiring
axioms and nothing else. **What it did not consume:** a field, additive inverses, or division.

**Anchors (checked, not merely cited):**

- Kelly & Laplaza, *Coherence for compact closed categories*, JPAA 19 (1980) — the coherence
  theorem, and the definition of compact closed this section uses.
- Selinger, *A survey of graphical languages for monoidal categories* (2011), §4.4 — `Mat(S)`
  over a commutative semiring as the standard compact-closed example. This is the anchor that
  **entails** our claim; a citation to Coecke–Sadrzadeh–Clark alone would not, because that paper
  works in `FdHilb` and assumes the field.
- Coecke, Sadrzadeh & Clark, *Mathematical foundations for a compositional distributional model
  of meaning* (2010) — what DisCoCat actually requires: a compact closed category, with pregroup
  reductions (Lambek 1958, 2008) sent to cups and caps.

### 1.3 The three conditions, checked against the shipped types

**(a) `'K` finite is necessary and is not enforced.** Both types constrain `'K` only by
`'K : comparison`. Elements have **finite support**, which is enough to be a free module, and is
**not** enough to be dualizable: for infinite `K` the free module `⊕_K W` has dual `∏_K W`, and
`⊕_K W ≇ ∏_K W`. Dualizability fails, so `η` does not exist. The code shows this precisely — you
can write `inner` (the cap) from finite support alone, and you cannot write `Σ_{k∈K} e_k ⊗ e_k`
without enumerating a basis the type does not promise is finite. **The absence of a cup in the
tree is not an oversight; it is the type signature telling the truth.**

**(b) `'W` commutative is necessary, and this is *stricter* than what `IStarRing` documents.**
`src/Core.Abstractions/IStarRing.cs` already carries a law profile:

> *"`Mul` loses commutativity above ℂ, associativity above ℍ … Consumers that require `Mul`
> associativity (e.g. matrix-style contraction) must stay at ℍ or below."*

Compact closure needs more than that. The Kronecker product is a bifunctor only if the
interchange law `(A⊗B)(C⊗D) = (AC)⊗(BD)` holds, and that computation **commutes two weights**. So:

| requirement | ceiling on the Cayley–Dickson tower |
|---|---|
| matrix contraction (already documented) | associativity → **ℍ and below** |
| **symmetric monoidal + compact closed (new)** | **commutativity → ℂ and below** |

Quaternionic, octonionic and sedenionic weights are excluded from any DisCoCat-shaped use. Every
other in-tree ring qualifies: `IntegerRing`, `LogProbRing`, `TropicalRing`, `BooleanRing`, ℂ.

**(c) A field is *not* required, and no additive inverse is required.** This is the good news and
it is worth stating loudly, because it means the tropical, log-probability and Boolean corners
— which `FourCornerTrace` explicitly refuses the *retraction* to, for want of `−w` — are
nonetheless perfectly good compact-closed corners. Duality does not need negation.

### 1.4 The PR #14302 warning is correctly scoped and does **not** bear on this

> *"`WeightedSet`'s ⊗ has no Bayesian meaning under `h`."*

Read in context (`docs/research/2026-08-23-what-discretisation-costs-…`, §2.4) that is a claim
about the **embedding** `h : Gaussian → WeightedSet<NatCoord, ℝ>` with `|'K| = 2`, in which the
Gaussian's natural parameters are the **weights**. Under `h`, `scale`/`inner` mean nothing
Bayesian — correct, and it narrows PR #14243's "semiring homomorphism" claim, also correct.

It is **not** a claim that `WSet.tensor` fails to be the categorical tensor. It is. What fails is
that **`h` is not a monoidal functor**. Those are different sentences and merging them would cost
the whole DisCoCat route for no reason.

*"If it is not the categorical tensor, say what operation would be"* — answered by naming all
three structures `Mat(W)` carries, which are routinely conflated:

| structure | what it is | in the tree |
|---|---|---|
| **+** — addition of *parallel* morphisms (the CMon enrichment) | `(f+g)[k] = f[k] ⊕ g[k]` | `WeightedSet.add`, `WSet.plus` |
| **⊕** — the **biproduct** on objects | disjoint union of key sets, `Choice<'K1,'K2>` | **nothing implements it** |
| **⊗** — the **monoidal tensor** | Kronecker on `'K1 * 'K2` | `WSet.tensor` ✅ |

`WeightedSet.scale` is none of these; it is the scalar action of `W` on the module.

### 1.5 One structural tension worth naming before someone refactors into it

`WSet.fs` is deliberately building the **Markov / CD** corner — `copy` Δ and `discard` !, with
the file's own honest note that `apply op` is **not** a comonoid homomorphism (Fox 1976:
cartesian ⟺ every morphism is one). DisCoCat wants the **compact closed** corner. These coexist
here only because that naturality genuinely fails.

**Houston (2008), *Finite products are biproducts in a compact closed category*, JPAA 212**:
if a compact closed category has finite products, they are **biproducts**. So a future
"make everything copyable / discardable" refactor would not merely add convenience — it would
force ⊗ into a biproduct and collapse the structure DisCoCat needs. In `Mat(W)` the resolution is
already the right one: ⊕ (disjoint union of bases) is the biproduct, ⊗ (Kronecker) is not, and
they must never be identified.

### 1.6 A cross-oracle divergence found while reading

`src/Core.TypeScript/algebra/wset.ts:116` types the linear-operator application
**heteromorphically**:

```ts
export function applyWSet<K1, K2, W>(ring, op: (k: K1) => WSet<K2, W>, set: WSet<K1, W>): WSet<K2, W>
```

`src/Core/WSet.fs:51` types it as an **endomorphism** — `op: 'K -> WSet<'K,'W>`, same `'K` in and
out. A pregroup reduction is inherently heteromorphic (`n·nʳ·s → s` changes the type), so the F#
oracle cannot express a DisCoCat morphism that the TypeScript oracle can. Reported as a finding;
the fix belongs to the code phase Aaron has sequenced after this analysis.

### 1.7 Verdict

- **Compact closure of `Mat('W)` for finite `'K` and commutative `'W`: theorem (borrowed, checked).**
- **Compact closure of the shipped `WeightedSet<'K,'W>` / `WSet<'K,'W>`: refuted as implemented** —
  no cup, no finiteness constraint, and the two halves that do exist live in different files.
- **What would change the verdict:** a `FiniteKey` constraint (an enumerable basis) plus a
  commutativity marker on the ring, at which point the cup becomes writable and the snakes become
  statable. That is a *type-level* change, not an algorithm.

## 2. Q2 — Does dual flatness entail the vector-addition update?

### 2.1 Short answer: no, and the implication runs the other way

Three propositions, kept strictly apart:

- **(E)** the family is an exponential family, `p(x|θ) = h(x) exp(⟨θ, T(x)⟩ − A(θ))`;
- **(D)** the manifold is **dually flat** — `(g, ∇, ∇*)` with `g` the Fisher metric, `θ` e-affine
  and `η = ∇A(θ)` m-affine, Legendre-dual;
- **(A)** the conjugate posterior update is **vector addition** in the prior family's natural
  coordinates.

What is true:

| implication | status | why |
|---|---|---|
| **E ⟹ D** | theorem | Amari & Nagaoka 2000, §3.5 — `A` is convex, `g = ∇²A`, `θ`/`η` are the dual affine charts |
| **E + conjugacy ⟹ A** | theorem, one line | multiply the exponentials, add the exponents: `exp⟨θ,T⟩·exp⟨θ',T⟩ = exp⟨θ+θ',T⟩` |
| **A ⟹ E (essentially), hence A ⟹ D** | theorem | closure under multiplication with parameters adding *is* an exponential form in those parameters |
| **D ⟹ A** | **FALSE** | two counterexamples below |

So **dual flatness accompanies the additivity and does not produce it.** The producer is the
exponential/conjugate structure — the Pitman–Koopman–Darmois setting, where a fixed-dimension
sufficient statistic exists precisely for exponential families.

### 2.2 Counterexample 1 — outside the family

The Gaussian sampling family is dually flat. Put a **Student-t** (or Laplace, or uniform-on-`[0,1]`)
prior on `μ`. The posterior is not in the prior family at all; there is no vector to add. Dual
flatness of the sampling manifold is untouched and buys nothing.

### 2.3 Counterexample 2 — *inside* the very same manifold, which is the sharper one

Dual flatness supplies **two** canonical affine charts, `θ` and `η`, and they are on equal footing
in the theory. The update is addition in `θ`. In `η` it is

```
η  ↦  ∇A( ∇A*(η) + T(x) )
```

which is not addition. **A dually flat manifold has a chart in which its own update is not
additive.** Dual flatness therefore cannot be what makes the update additive; something has to
*pick the chart*, and that something is conjugacy.

### 2.4 The tree already demonstrates this, in `Message.fs`

The three shipped message families make the same point without commentary:

| family | stored coordinate | `( * )` | additive? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Gaussian` | `(ν, τ) = (μτ, 1/σ²)` | `ν₁+ν₂`, `τ₁+τ₂` | **yes** — an affine image of the natural parameter |
| `Beta` | `(α, β)` | `α₁+α₂−1` | yes **in `(α−1, β−1)`** — affine, so still e-affine |
| `Bernoulli` | `ProbTrue` | `t/(t+f)` after multiplying masses | **no** — additive in *log-odds*, and `ProbTrue` is a non-affine chart of that same group |

`Bernoulli` is the in-tree witness that additivity is **chart-relative**. Same theorem, three
charts, one of which hides it.

### 2.5 And it is *not* a lucky parameterisation — the other half of the question

The natural parameterisation of an exponential family is **canonically determined up to an affine
transformation** of `θ` (the minimal representation is unique up to `θ ↦ Mθ + b` with the
statistic transforming contravariantly). Since additivity is preserved by affine change of
coordinates, there is nothing to be lucky about: *any* minimal natural chart makes the update
additive, and the shipped `{PrecisionMean; Precision}` is one.

So the question's disjunction — *structural, or a lucky parameterisation?* — has the answer
**structural**, with the source relocated: **conjugacy in an exponential family**, not dual
flatness.

### 2.6 Already partly in-tree

`docs/research/2026-08-20-the-belief-manifold-is-hyperbolic-…-lumen.md` §5 already records:

> *"Natural parameters `θ = (ν, −τ/2)` are the affine coordinates of Amari's e-connection … so
> **Bayesian updating is literally translation in this chart**. … The affine structure is earned.
> The metric laid on top of it is not."*

This section adds the **negative** half that document did not need: dual flatness does not entail
the translation, and there is a chart of the same dually flat manifold in which the update is not
a translation. The split *"affine earned, metric not"* is the correct and load-bearing one, and
§3 is where it starts costing money.

**Verdict: theorem, with the implication direction reversed from the conjecture.**

## 3. Q3 — A Normal-Gamma posterior as a region in a conceptual space

This is the load-bearing question for the inversion, and it does not survive contact in the form
it was asked. It decomposes into three questions that each have a clean answer.

### 3.1 The question is ill-posed until three objects are separated

| object | what it is | is a posterior a *region* here? |
|---|---|---|
| **G1 — the statistical manifold** | points are NG *distributions*; coordinates `(m, λ, α, β)` or `θ ∈ ℝ⁴`; dually flat, Fisher metric `∇²A` | **No.** A posterior is a **point**. There is no region to be convex. |
| **G2 — the parameter space** `(μ, τ) ∈ ℝ × ℝ₊` | points are candidate (mean, precision) values | Yes — a credible set / superlevel set. **This is the only Gärdenfors-shaped reading.** |
| **G3 — the sample space** `x ∈ ℝ` | points are observations; the NG posterior predictive is Student-t | Yes, but in 1-D **every** superlevel set of a unimodal density is an interval, hence convex. **Zero information.** |

Gärdenfors' conceptual spaces have *objects/percepts* as points, so the honest reading is **G2**.
A claim stated on G1 ("the posterior is a convex region") is a category error: it is a point.
A claim stated on G3 is vacuous in one dimension.

### 3.2 In the `(μ, τ)` chart the answer is **NO**, and here is the witness

Take `NG(m=0, λ=1, α=2, β=1)`, `log f(μ,τ) = (α−½)log τ − βτ − (λτ/2)(μ−m)²`:

| point | `log f` |
|---|---|
| `A = (−6.00, 0.25)` | **−6.829442** |
| `B = (−1.00, 6.00)` | **−6.312361** |
| midpoint `(−3.50, 3.125)` | **−20.556474** |

The midpoint is 13.7 nats **below** both endpoints. So the superlevel set at
`c = min(f(A), f(B))` contains `A` and `B` and not the segment between them: **not convex, and
not quasi-concave.** Analytically,

```
det H(log f)  =  λ(α−½)/τ  −  λ²(μ−m)²        <  0   whenever   (μ−m)² > (α−½)/(λτ)
```

— the Hessian is **indefinite** on an unbounded region (matched to finite differences to 4
decimals in the script). Contrast this with the intuition offered in the brief: *a Gaussian's
level sets are convex*. True — for a Gaussian **in `μ` at fixed `τ`**. The joint Normal-Gamma is
not log-concave, because the cross term `−τ(μ−m)²/2` is bilinear-with-a-square and its Hessian
determinant is `−λ²(μ−m)²` at leading order.

**So the suggestive fact in the brief does not survive to the object we actually carry.**

### 3.3 In sufficient-statistic coordinates the answer is **YES, and stronger than convex**

> **Theorem (easy, general).** Let `p_θ(z) = h(z) exp(⟨θ, T(z)⟩ − A(θ))` be an exponential family
> with sufficient statistic `T : Z → ℝ^d`. Then for every `c > 0`
>
> ```
> { z : p_θ(z)/h(z) ≥ c }  =  T⁻¹( { t ∈ ℝ^d : ⟨θ, t⟩ ≥ log c + A(θ) } )
> ```
>
> — the preimage of a **closed half-space**. Highest-density regions of an exponential family
> are half-space preimages under `T`; convexity is not merely available, it is the weakest thing
> you can say.

For Normal-Gamma this is exact with `h ≡ 1`:

```
T(μ, τ) = ( log τ,  τ,  τμ,  τμ² )          θ = ( α−½,  −(β + λm²/2),  λm,  −λ/2 )
```

Checked: `max |⟨θ, T(μ,τ)⟩ − log f(μ,τ)| = 5.7e-14` over 20 000 random points (§W3). And `T` is
injective (`τ` from component 2, `μ` from components 3 and 2), so it is an embedding of the
2-manifold `ℝ × ℝ₊` into `ℝ⁴`.

**The reconciliation of §3.2 and §3.3 is the whole result:**

> **Convexity is an *affine* notion, not a metric one, and it is not invariant under
> diffeomorphism.** The same posterior is non-convex in `(μ, τ)` and a half-space in `T`. A
> Gärdenfors claim is therefore **meaningless until the quality dimensions are fixed**, and
> fixing them is a modelling decision that the geometry does not make for you.

Worse for the inversion: a dually flat manifold has **two** canonical affine structures (e- and
m-), hence **two** inequivalent convexities, and the Fisher–Rao Levi-Civita geodesics give a
**third**. "Convex region" is ambiguous by a factor of three on the very object being proposed as
the root.

### 3.4 The named metric

- **Fisher–Rao** (Rao 1945, *Bull. Calcutta Math. Soc.* 37, 81–95) is the metric, and it is
  **canonical** rather than chosen: **Čencov/Chentsov 1972/1982** proves it is the unique
  Riemannian metric (up to scale) invariant under sufficient statistics / Markov morphisms. It
  *is* a metric — symmetric, triangle inequality — which Gärdenfors' Voronoi machinery requires.
- **KL is not a metric** (not symmetric, no triangle inequality). It is a Bregman divergence of
  `A`. Anyone writing "the metric is KL" has not got a metric.
- **Closed form:** for the univariate normal, Atkinson & Mitchell 1981 (hyperbolic, `K = −½`,
  already computed three ways in the 2026-08-20 in-tree document). **For the 4-parameter
  Normal-Gamma family there is no closed-form Rao distance known to this hat** — it is a dually
  flat 4-manifold with `g = ∇²A`, computable numerically. Stated as a limit, not glossed.

### 3.5 The stated approximation error — and the refutation it delivers

The inversion's load-bearing sentence is *"the Bayesian layer is an optimization / fast
approximation of a geometric root."* An approximation needs an approximated object and a bound.
Both exist, and what they show is not what the sentence claims.

**Conjugate lane — error is exactly zero, so it is not an approximation.** By §2, the conjugate
update *is* translation in the e-affine chart. Error `= 0` identically. **Bayes is not
approximating that geometry; it is an isomorphism onto it.** Calling it "an optimization of" a
geometric root is therefore a **modelling change wearing an efficiency label** — precisely the
move `toy-is-free-metered-must-be-earned` exists to catch. **Refuted, for the conjugate lane.**

**Non-conjugate lane — here there is a real error, and it is named.** EP/ADF's moment-matching
step is exactly the **m-projection** `Π_M p` onto the e-flat family `M`, and:

- **Projection theorem** (Amari & Nagaoka 2000, Thm 3.9): the m-projection onto an e-flat
  submanifold is unique and minimises `D_KL(p ‖ ·)`.
- **Generalised Pythagorean theorem** (ibid., Thm 3.8): for every `q ∈ M`,
  `D_KL(p ‖ q) = D_KL(p ‖ Π_M p) + D_KL(Π_M p ‖ q)`.

So the approximation error is **`D_KL(p ‖ Π_M p)` nats**, it is *additive* against any target in
the family, and the "optimization" framing is **correct here and only here**. `Message.fs`'s own
docstring already names Minka 2001 for the cavity; this is the geometry that step lives in.

**And PR #14268's NF4 finding is this observation, made without naming it.** *"NF4's quantile grid
is 2.8× worse than uniform by KL, because every surveyed method minimises an L2 on point weights,
none targets a divergence."* That is: the quantizers optimise a Euclidean objective on a manifold
whose canonical geometry is Fisher–Rao, and pay for it in the divergence that actually matters.
The metric question is **real, measured, and already costing money** — it is not decorative.

### 3.6 Verdict

- Question **as asked: ill-posed** (three objects conflated).
- After repair: **half-space theorem** — theorem. **Non-convexity in `(μ,τ)`** — computed
  witness, refutes the suggestive reading. **m-projection error in KL with a Pythagorean
  decomposition** — theorem (borrowed). **"Bayes is a fast approximation of the geometry" for the
  conjugate lane** — **refuted**; error is identically zero and the relation is isomorphism.
- **What would make the Gärdenfors half precise:** name the quality dimensions. Until a chart is
  fixed, "convex region" has no truth value.
- **Addendum (§10):** Aaron's covariance/contravariance route supplies a **second, independent**
  derivation of the error term — the within-fibre Bregman information — and it lands on **exactly**
  this boundary: vacuous on the conjugate lane, exact on the non-conjugate one. It corroborates
  §3.5 and leaves the Gärdenfors half untouched.

## 4. Q4 — Does CGA compose with the in-tree Clifford substrate?

### 4.1 Stop: half of this is already answered in-tree, three days ago

`docs/research/2026-08-20-the-belief-manifold-is-hyperbolic-not-spherical-cl21-not-cl41-and-the-flat-rotor-verdict-moves-with-the-units-lumen.md`
§1 already settles the CGA question for the belief lane, with a table of **invariants** rather
than counts (compactness of the rotor group; zero divisors in the even subalgebra; bivector
squares):

> *"**Not Cl(4,1).** … `Cl(4,1)` is CGA of ℝ³ — a five-dimensional algebra for a three-dimensional
> flat space … Our parameter manifold is **two**-dimensional. … **Cl(2,1)** … the conformal group
> of the **sample space** ℝ¹ is `Cl(2,1)`, and the Poincaré extension theorem says the conformal
> group of ℝⁿ *is* `Isom(H^{n+1})`."*

So: **CGA does compose with the belief lane, at signature (2,1), by a named isomorphism** — and
the specific algebra the question proposes, `Cl(4,1)`, is the wrong one for a reason already on
the record. Per the assignment's own instruction, this half stops here rather than being
re-derived.

### 4.2 New: CGA **cannot** compose with the E8 lane, and the reason is a one-line refutation

`src/Core/CliffordE8Roots.fs:20` is explicit about its algebra:

> *"we treat each of the 8 coordinates as a grade-1 generator of a Euclidean Clifford algebra
> **Cl(8,0)** (all generators square to +1, pairwise anticommuting)."*

CGA of `ℝⁿ` is `Cl(n+1, 1)` and **requires `q ≥ 1`** — the null vectors `n₀`, `n∞` that make
points into null blades exist only because there is a negative direction.

> **A positive-definite quadratic form has no anisotropic vector of negative norm. Therefore

They are **different objects sharing the word "Clifford"** — 32-dimensional `M₄(ℂ)` versus
256-dimensional `M₁₆(ℝ)`, non-isomorphic, different signature classes on the mod-8 clock
(`s = 3` versus `s = 0`).

### 4.3 What *does* compose — two things, and both are already built

**(i) The classifier composes trivially, and needs no new code.**
`src/Core/CliffordPeriodicity.fs:84` `classify` is signature-general. CGA is already on the clock:

| signature | `s = p−q mod 8` | Morita type | `dim_ℝ` | in-tree role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Cl(4,1)` — CGA of ℝ³ | 3 | `M₄(ℂ)` | 32 = 2⁵ | the algebra the 08-20 doc **excluded** |
| `Cl(2,1)` — CGA of ℝ¹ ≅ `Isom(H²)` | 1 | `M₂(ℝ) ⊕ M₂(ℝ)` (split) | 8 = 2³ | the algebra it **selected** |
| `Cl(3,0)` — shipped `Cl3.fs` | 3 | `M₂(ℂ)` | 8 = 2³ | shipped, and wrong for the belief metric |
| `Cl(8,0)` — E8 root lane | 0 | `M₁₆(ℝ)` | 256 = 2⁸ | `CliffordE8Roots` |

Note the numerology trap that this table defuses: `Cl(2,1)` and `Cl(3,0)` are **both**
8-dimensional with **both** 3-dimensional rotor groups. Dimension excludes neither; the split-real
versus complex row does.

**(ii) The genuine shared mechanism is bivectors ⇒ `so(p,q)`, which is the *uncoded* route.**
`CliffordPeriodicity.bivectorDim` is exactly `dim Λ²(ℝⁿ) = n(n−1)/2 = dim so(n)`, and the module's
"second tower" reaches `e₈ = so(16) ⊕ Δ⁺₁₆` (120 + 128 = 248) by that construction. CGA's rotor
group `Spin⁺(n+1,1)` is the **same** construction at a different signature: the bivectors of
`Cl(n+1,1)` are `so(n+1,1)`, the conformal Lie algebra.

**So CGA composes with the *uncoded* (spinor/bivector) route's mechanism, and with *nothing* in
the *coded* route.** Construction A takes a doubly-even self-dual binary code to an even
unimodular **lattice**; there is no CGA analogue of a binary code, and the E8 **lattice** is not
the E8 **Lie algebra**. That distinction is hard-won (`CliffordPeriodicity.fs:172-231`) and this
section does not blur it: CGA touches the Lie-algebra side only.

### 4.4 One small finding in the classifier, reported not filed

`evenSubalgebraClass` implements `Cl⁰(p,q) ≅ Cl(p, q−1)` and returns `Error` when `q = 0`, calling
it *"a refusal rather than a wrap"*. The refusal is honest but avoidable: the standard
isomorphism has a **second form**, `Cl⁰(p,q) ≅ Cl(q, p−1)` (Lawson & Michelsohn, *Spin Geometry*,
I.3), which covers `q = 0`. The case it declines is not exotic — it is `Cl(3,0)`, the algebra
`Cl3.fs` ships, whose even subalgebra is `Cl(0,2) ≅ ℍ` (and the 08-20 document already uses that
fact in its exclusion table). Reported here; the fix belongs to the code phase.

### 4.5 Verdict

- **Belief lane × CGA: already answered in-tree** (Cl(2,1), 2026-08-20). Stop.
- **E8 lane × CGA: refuted** — no signature-preserving embedding into a positive-definite algebra.
- **Classifier × CGA: already composes**, zero new code.
- **Shared mechanism: bivectors ⇒ `so(p,q)`** — theorem, and it is the *uncoded* route only.

## 5. Q5 — Is Gärdenfors convexity testable on an embedding Zeta can build?

### 5.1 Yes, `LinguisticSeed` is already the geometric claim — and the anchor needs correcting

`src/Core/LinguisticSeed.fs` exposes exactly a Mercer-closed kernel algebra: base kernels
(`constant c≥0`, `feature`, `dot`, `indicator`) and closure operations (`sum`, `product` via Schur,
nonneg `scale`, `pullback`), plus `gram` / `quadForm` as the PSD witness. The claim "PSD by
construction" is sound: each base is PSD and each combinator provably preserves PSD.

> **Theorem (borrowed).** A positive semi-definite kernel `k : X × X → ℝ` determines a unique
> reproducing-kernel Hilbert space and a feature map `φ : X → H` with `k(a,b) = ⟨φa, φb⟩`
> (**Moore–Aronszajn 1950**), and `d(a,b) = √(k(a,a) − 2k(a,b) + k(b,b))` is a pseudo-metric on
> `X` isometrically embedded in `H` (**Schoenberg 1938**).

**So yes — "English (or a closed subset of it) is geometric" and "the linguistic seed is a
Mercer kernel" are the same statement.** That is a real answer to the question as asked.

**Anchor correction, in the spirit of `anchor-to-human-prior-art`'s *checked, not cited*:** the
module names **Mercer's theorem** (1909), which gives a *spectral eigenfunction expansion* and
requires a **continuous** kernel on a **compact** domain. `Kernel<'x> = 'x -> 'x -> float` has an
arbitrary `'x` with no topology, so Mercer's hypotheses are not available. The theorem that
actually entails the module's claim is **Moore–Aronszajn**, which needs only PSD. The
`Mercer-closure` naming for the *combinator closure* is fine and standard; the *existence of the
geometry* should cite Moore–Aronszajn. This is a one-word docstring fix in the code phase.

### 5.2 And that is exactly why the existence claim is vacuous

`LinguisticSeed.indicator` is `k(a,b) = 1 if a = b else 0`. Its feature map sends every `x` to a
distinct **orthonormal basis vector** `e_x`. Then for any subset `C ⊆ X`:

```
conv{ e_x : x ∈ C }  ∩  { e_y : y ∈ X }  =  { e_x : x ∈ C }
```

because a convex combination of distinct basis vectors with more than one nonzero coefficient is
never a basis vector. **Every subset of every set is convex under `indicator`.** No categorisation
of English — natural, arbitrary, or adversarial — can fail.

This is the vacuity class in its purest form, and it is reachable with a function that is already
in the tree. It also generalises: **the existence of a geometry is free**, because any set at all
admits `indicator`. So "English is geometric" cannot be false, and therefore carries no
information. **All the content must live in *which* kernel, and in what that kernel predicts.**

(Sharper still: `composePacks []` reduces to `constant 0.0`, whose induced pseudo-metric is
identically zero — every subset is convex *and* every subset is a ball.)

### 5.3 The obstruction is **not** infinite-dimensionality — a correction to the question

The brief asks whether *"the RKHS's infinite-dimensionality makes convexity vacuous or
untestable."* It does not, and the diagnosis matters because it changes the repair.

The obstruction is that **affine convexity is a statement about the ambient space, while the data
live on a thin curved image `φ(X) ⊂ H`.** Generic points of `conv(φ(C))` are not in `φ(X)` at all,
so the membership test "every point between two members is a member" has an empty antecedent and
passes by default. That is true in `ℝ³` for a curved surface just as it is in an infinite-
dimensional Hilbert space. Dimension is a red herring.

### 5.4 The two repairs, and only one of them has teeth

**Repair A — Menger betweenness (Menger 1928).** State convexity metrically:
`C` is convex iff for all `a, b ∈ C` and all `c ∈ X` with `d(a,c) + d(c,b) = d(a,b)`, `c ∈ C`.
This is computable from `k` alone, and it *can* fail — so it is at least **statable**. But in a
strictly convex Hilbert space exact betweenness holds on a measure-zero set, so on finite data the
test is again near-vacuous unless it is graded to `d(a,c) + d(c,b) ≤ (1+ε)·d(a,b)`, at which point
the verdict is threshold-dependent and the threshold is unprincipled. **Honest, weak.**

**Repair B — the model-comparison form, which is the one to route.** Gärdenfors' own key result
(*Conceptual Spaces*, 2000, §3.9, on Okabe, Boots & Sugihara's Voronoi theory) is that concepts
generated by **prototypes under nearest-neighbour** are convex **automatically**. So convexity is
not the empirical content — it is a *consequence* of the prototype model. The falsifiable question
is therefore:

> **Does a prototype/Voronoi model over the kernel metric predict held-out category membership
> better than a pre-registered set of alternatives (nearest-neighbour-to-all-exemplars, linear
> separator, logistic on `φ`) — on a corpus fixed in advance?**

That can come out negative, it is measured in held-out log-likelihood, and it does not require
proving anything. It converts an unfalsifiable geometric assertion into a model comparison.

### 5.5 A blocking practicality

`LinguisticSeed` exposes `gram` and `quadForm` and **no distance function**. Convexity — under
either repair — is not computable from the module's current API without first writing
`d(a,b) = √(k(a,a) − 2k(a,b) + k(b,b))`. Two lines, and they are not there. Reported; code phase.

### 5.6 Verdict

- **"A Mercer kernel is a geometry" / "`LinguisticSeed` already IS the claim": theorem
  (borrowed)**, with the anchor moved from Mercer 1909 to Moore–Aronszajn 1950.
- **"Natural categories are convex in the RKHS", as affine convexity: vacuity class** —
  demonstrated false-by-triviality on the in-tree `indicator` kernel.
- **After Repair B: conjecture**, and — importantly — **not a proof obligation**. Routing it to
  a theorem prover would itself be the category error.

## 6. What goes to Soraya, and with which tool

Per `CLAUDE.md`: this hat has the mapping, `formal-verification-expert` proves it. Tool choice is
hers to confirm; this is the recommendation and the reason.

| # | Obligation | Tool | Why that tool |
|---|---|---|---|
| **S1** | Compact closure of `Mat(W)` for `W` a commutative semiring and finite basis: `η`, `ε`, both snake identities. | **Lean 4** | Purely categorical/equational. Mathlib carries `CategoryTheory.Monoidal.Rigid` (`ExactPairing`, `evaluation`/`coevaluation`), `Matrix`, `Module.Dual`, `Basis`. Z3 cannot express a coherence law. |
| **S2** | The **negative**: `⊕_K W` is not dualizable for infinite `K` (its dual is `∏_K W`). | **Lean 4** | Same library. This is the half that justifies a `FiniteKey` constraint rather than a comment. |
| **S3** | Conjugate exponential-family update = translation in natural coordinates; **and** the non-implication `D ⇏ A` via the η-chart counterexample of §2.3. | **Lean 4** for the algebraic identity; **a computed witness** for the counterexample | The identity is `exp⟨θ,T⟩·exp⟨θ',T⟩ = exp⟨θ+θ',T⟩` — clean equational content. The counterexample needs no prover, only a check that cannot pass by accident. |
| **S4** | `(μ−m)² > (α−½)/(λτ) ⟹ det H(log f_NG) < 0`, i.e. the exact boundary of the non-log-concave region. | **Z3** | Nonlinear real arithmetic over a polynomial inequality — decidable, and exactly Z3's shape. The §3.2 witness becomes a regression test; Z3 supplies the *general* statement. |
| **S5** | The half-space theorem of §3.3, stated for a general exponential family. | **Lean 4** (short) | `{z : ⟨θ,T z⟩ ≥ c}` is a preimage of a half-space — near-trivial in Mathlib, and worth having because it is the *positive* geometric result the inversion can actually stand on. |
| — | **NOT for Soraya:** the Gärdenfors question (Q5). | none | It is an empirical model comparison, not a proof obligation (§5.4). Misrouting it would manufacture a proof of something that is not a theorem. |
| — | **NOT for Soraya:** the Amari–Nagaoka Pythagorean/projection theorems (§3.5). | citation check | Borrowed, published, and already proved. The obligation is `missing-citations` / checked-anchor discipline, not re-proof. |

### 6.1 Filed (theory only — no implementation items; Aaron sequenced code after the analysis)

| work-item | covers | route |
|---|---|---|
| `081M0R1RP76087G0R003YFWNYK` | S1 + S2 — compact closure of `Mat(W)` for a finite basis, non-dualizability for an infinite one | Soraya, **Lean 4** |
| `081M0R1RV1Z087G0R0004SVNXJ` | S3 — the conjugate translation theorem, and the refutation of dual flatness as its source | Soraya, **Lean 4** + a computed witness |
| `081M0R1RV2Y087G0R003W65SGD` | S4 + S5 — the NG non-log-concavity boundary, and the half-space theorem | Soraya, **Z3** + **Lean 4** |
| `081M0R1RV3T087G0R001YAWXNK` | Q5 — pre-register the Gärdenfors question as a **model comparison**, explicitly not routed to a prover | not Soraya |
| `081M0R34AZY087G0R001H9N6YS` | §10 — descent along a coarsening: the exact iff, extensive vs intensive, Pythagorean = within-fibre Bregman information | Soraya, **Lean 4** + a computed witness |

Three findings are reported in this document and deliberately **not** filed as work-items, because
each is a code change and code is sequenced after the analysis: the F#/TypeScript `apply` arity
divergence (§1.6), `evenSubalgebraClass`'s avoidable `q = 0` refusal (§4.4), and `LinguisticSeed`'s
missing distance function plus its Mercer→Moore–Aronszajn anchor correction (§5.5, §5.1).

---

## 7. The two framing constraints, honoured explicitly

### 7.1 Architectural primacy is not epistemic primacy

The measured layer is the Bayesian one. NG4: max KL **4.0e-8** over 4096 weights, **0** invalid
decodes at `rgba32float`, bit-for-bit associativity, and a **measured refutation** of the
Student-t alternative — plus the honest register that the whole thing is `toy`. The geometric root
has **zero implementation**, and three of the five answers above are negative or ill-posed.

Choosing geometry as the *architectural* root is legitimate — it is a claim about where the
generator sits, and `only-the-irreducible-is-primitive-generate-the-rest` is a real reason to want
it. But the root would then be the **least** evidenced part of the stack, and the layer above it
would be supplying all the confidence. The specific trap: an inversion that quietly re-labels the
measured layer as "an optimization of" the unmeasured one lets the root **inherit** the
measurements without earning them. §3.5 shows that for the conjugate lane the label is not just
unearned but **false** — the error is zero, so there is nothing being optimised.

**The defensible version of the inversion**, on the evidence here:

> The **affine** structure (natural parameters, e-connection, translation-as-update) is earned and
> is already the root — the tree has been building on it since `Message.fs`. What is *not* earned
> is the **metric** laid on top of it, and that is exactly where a geometric root would add
> something: Fisher–Rao is canonical by Čencov, the flat chart is measurably wrong
> (116.57°, verdict swinging 0.9998 → 0.000006 under a unit change), and NF4's 2.8× KL penalty is
> the same defect in the quantiser. **Root the metric, not the update.**

That is a smaller claim than "geometry is the root", it is supported by every measurement in this
document and the two before it, and it is buildable.

### 7.2 The phenomenological report

Aaron's *"I see English geometrically in my head"* is **authoritative about his experience and is
not evidence for the formal claim.** Under
`.claude/rules/engagement-profiles-*` the discipline is *ask, don't infer*, and the report is his
to give; under `numerology-vs-number-theory` a resonance is a **generator**, and a very good one —
it is why Q5 got asked at all, and Q5 produced a real result (§5.1: the claim is already
implemented, in different words). What it cannot do is carry a truth value about RKHS convexity,
because the index stores the resonance and not the evidence. Both halves are true at once and
neither is a slight.

## 8. Proposed register rows (§B) — **proposed, not landed**

Advisory scope: `docs/FROZEN-CORE-AND-CONJECTURE-REGISTER.md` is not edited by this PR. These are

**Z-G1 — Compact closure of the weighted-set substrate.** *Is the finite-basis restriction of
`WeightedSet`/`WSet` over a commutative semiring a compact closed category, with both snake
identities?* **Discharge:** a Lean 4 proof of `η`, `ε` and both triangle identities for `Mat(W)`,
plus the negative for infinite bases (S1, S2). **Falsifier:** exhibit a commutative semiring and a
finite `K` for which a snake fails, **or** show that the shipped types admit no `FiniteKey`
refinement without breaking a current consumer. *Register today: **refuted as implemented** — no
cup exists and no finiteness constraint is expressible.*

**Z-G2 — The metric, not the update, is where geometry is unearned.** *Is every measured defect in
the soft regime attributable to the metric rather than to the affine structure?* Supported by
three independent measurements (the 116.57° chart error and unit-dependent verdict, 2026-08-20;
NF4's 2.8× KL penalty, PR #14268; NG's non-convexity in the natural chart, §3.2). **Falsifier:** a
measured soft-regime defect that is a defect of the *affine* structure — i.e. one that persists
after the metric is corrected to Fisher–Rao. *Register: **conjecture**.*

**Z-G3 — Gärdenfors convexity over the linguistic seed.** *Does a prototype/Voronoi model over the
`LinguisticSeed` kernel metric predict held-out category membership better than a pre-registered
alternative set?* **Falsifier:** the pre-registered baselines win on held-out log-likelihood.
*Register: **conjecture**, and explicitly an empirical one — §5.2 shows the affine-convexity form
is the vacuity class and must never be registered in its place.*

## 10. ADDENDUM — variance, coarsening, and whether that gives Q3 a proof technique

**Verdict in four lines.**

| claim | verdict |
|---|---|
| coarsening = quotient; pullback free, pushforward needs constancy on fibres | **theorem — and incomplete.** The dichotomy is *extensive vs intensive*, and BOTH directions are free, in **opposite** variances (§10.1) |
| C# variance and tensor variance are the same functorial notion | **theorem, with the translation written out** (§10.2). Not a shared word — for covectors it is literally the same sentence |
| Clifford/GA makes it "more precise" by unifying the two variances | **refuted as stated.** The **metric** unifies them, not GA; GA makes it **index-free**, which is a notational claim, not a precision claim (§10.3) |
| the route gives Q3 a computable error term | **real, and it reproduces §3.5's boundary exactly** — vacuous on the conjugate lane, exact on the non-conjugate one. It **corroborates**; it does not extend, and it does **not** touch the Gärdenfors half (§10.4) |

Numbers below reproduce from
`docs/research/scripts/2026-08-23-geometry-as-root-bregman-coarsening-verify.py` (`ALL PASS`, exit 0).

### 10.1 The formalisation is right, and the dichotomy needs one more distinction

Let `q : N → C` be the coarsening (names → clusters), surjective, fibres `q⁻¹(c)`.

> **Theorem (universal property of the quotient, `Set`).** For surjective `q` and any `g : N → X`,
> a map `ḡ : C → X` with `ḡ ∘ q = g` exists **iff** `ker q ⊆ ker g` — i.e. iff `g` is constant on
> fibres — and is then unique.

So *"pullback is unconditional, pushforward needs a hypothesis"* is **exactly right**, it is a
theorem and not an analogy, and the hypothesis is an **iff**: for *exact* descent there is no
weaker condition, bounded variation included. Good.

**The distinction the framing is missing, and it changes the answer for the actual design.**
There are two pushforwards, not one, and they have opposite freedom:

| carried object | pull back along `q` | push forward along `q` |
|---|---|---|
| **function** `N → X` (intensive — a *per-item* rate) | **free** (`q*f = f ∘ q`) | needs **constancy on fibres** |
| **measure** on `N` (extensive — a *count*) | needs a disintegration / section | **free** (`q_*μ(c) = μ(q⁻¹(c))`) |

So: *"the change rate of a cluster"* is **already well-defined with no hypothesis** if it means
**total changes per unit time across the cluster** — that is a pushforward of a *measure*, and
measures push forward freely. It needs the coherence hypothesis only if it means **the rate each
member has**, which is a function.

**And this is not a technicality — it is the DV2.0 criterion restated.** DV2.0 partitions by
*change rate*, so a cluster whose members' change rates disagree is precisely a cluster that has
merged a **hub** with a **satellite**. The discharge condition and the design's own purpose are
the same condition:

> **A coarsening is DV2.0-admissible exactly when the change-rate function is (near-)constant on
> its fibres. Within-fibre change-rate dispersion is not noise in the measurement — it is the
> measurement that the cluster is wrong.**

That is a falsifiable statement about the naming-registry design, available before it is built.

**The weaker-than-equality condition, named properly.** For *approximate* descent into a metric
or Bregman geometry the error is the **within-fibre dispersion**, and it has an exact accounting
identity (§10.4). Not "bounded variation" — the right names are the **oscillation** `sup − inf`
(L^∞, minimised by the Chebyshev centre) or the **within-fibre variance** (L², minimised by the
barycentre), and in the Bregman setting the **within-cluster Bregman information**.

### 10.2 The variance word — same notion, labels swapped by exactly one `op`

**The trap is real and the direction stated in the brief is correct.** Written out both ways so
the translation is checkable rather than asserted:

| object | along `f : M → N` | physics index | **physics name** | **categorical name** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| tangent vector | **pushes forward** `f_*` | upper `V^i` | *contravariant* | **covariant** functor |
| covector | **pulls back** `f*` | lower `ω_i` | *covariant* | **contravariant** functor |

**Both labels are swapped, consistently — and there is a reason, which is what makes this a
translation rather than a coincidence.** Physics names how *components* transform **relative to
the basis**: with `V = V^i e_i` invariant, the components `V^i` must transform *against* the basis
(hence "contra"), while covector components transform *with* it (hence "co"). Category theory
names how the *functor* acts on **morphisms**. A basis change is itself contravariant in the
components, so the two conventions differ by **exactly one application of `op`** — uniform,
invertible, and derivable rather than memorised.

**And for covectors it is not an analogy at all — it is the same sentence.** A covector *is* a map
`V → ℝ`. In C# that is `Func<in T, out TResult>`, and the language's rule says it is
**contravariant in `T`**. So *"covectors pull back"* and *"`Func<in T, ·>` is contravariant"* are
one statement in two vocabularies. Under `.claude/rules/numerology-vs-number-theory.md` this is an
identification by **structure**, not by a matching word, and it passes.

**What does NOT transfer, so the scope is honest:**

- C# variance lives on a **preorder** (subtyping) — no non-trivial composition, no metric, no
  smooth structure. Tensor variance lives on the groupoid of coordinate changes, or on `Man`.
- C#'s variance is decided **syntactically** by position (`in`/`out`). Tensor variance interacts
  with a metric.
- **Decisively: C# has no analogue of raising and lowering indices**, because a subtyping order
  carries no metric. So the *conversion* between the two variances — the operation that makes
  tensor calculus work — **has no C# counterpart at all.**

> **The notion of *direction* is identical. Everything the *metric* supplies exists on one side
> only.** Both halves have to be said, or the identification is doing more work than it earns.

**Anchors.** Mac Lane, *Categories for the Working Mathematician* (2nd ed. 1998) I.2 — a
contravariant functor is a functor on `C^op`; this is the definition both conventions are measured
against. The C# side is the language specification's variance rules for `in`/`out` type
parameters. Brian Beckman is Aaron's stated source for the physics/category convergence and is a
real independent lineage (**his published public lectures**, per
`.claude/rules/engagement-profiles-public-work-only-not-surveillance-dossiers.md`: public work is
cited, nothing else is); the load-bearing citations above are Mac Lane and the language spec, not
him — an anchor should carry only what it actually entails.

### 10.3 The Clifford half — "unifies" is refuted, "index-free" is true

Two different claims were on offer and only the weaker one survives.

**Does GA *unify* the two variances? No — the metric does, and GA is not needed for it.** The
**musical isomorphisms** `♭ : V → V*, v ↦ g(v, ·)` and `♯ = ♭⁻¹` are exactly index lowering and
raising, and they exist in **any** non-degenerate inner-product space. Riemannian geometry has
them without Clifford algebra anywhere. GA cannot claim the unification; it inherits it.

**Does GA *express* both uniformly? Yes — and that is the real gain.** In `Cl(V,q)` the metric is
inside the product (`a·b = ½(ab + ba)` *recovers* it), so the algebra is naturally **index-free**
and the covariant/contravariant bookkeeping leaves the notation: vectors and covectors are both
grade-1 elements, and the distinction is carried by the product rather than by index placement.

So the accurate word is **"index-free / notation-uniform"**, not *"more precise"* and not
*"unifies"*. Those are three different claims and only the middle one is true.

**Two cautions that cost something later if skipped:**

1. **GA has two distinct dualities and they are not the same map.** The musical isomorphism
   (`V ↔ V*`, grade-preserving, metric) and the **pseudoscalar dual** `A ↦ A·I⁻¹` (grade `k ↦ n−k`,
   Hodge-shaped) are different operations. Conflating them is a live trap in exactly the kind of
   argument this section is evaluating.
2. **The identification `V ≅ V*` is pointwise and not natural.** It depends on the metric at the
   point. On a *statistical* manifold the metric is the **Fisher matrix, which is not constant** —
   the 2026-08-20 document measured its condition number at **508** at `(ν, τ) = (20, 10)`. So
   "vectors and covectors are the same thing" is safe on a flat metric space and is **exactly the
   error that document caught** when carried onto the belief manifold. The Clifford framing does
   not rescue that; it is the same defect in nicer notation.

### 10.4 Does the route give Q3 a computable error term? Yes — and it reproduces §3.5's boundary

This is the substantive half, and it works better than the framing proposed, because the coarsening
in question is not hypothetical — **it is already in the tree, twice, and the two instances are
different operators.**

**The coarsening is the m-projection.** EP/ADF's moment-matching step `Π_M : P → M` is a
retraction whose fibres are `Π_M⁻¹(q) = { p : E_p[T] = E_q[T] }` — the distributions sharing a
sufficient statistic. That is literally *"cluster by having the same moments, then measure over
the cluster"*, so `Π_M` **is** a coarsening `q : N → C` in the sense of §10.1, not an analogy.

**The error term is the within-cluster Bregman information, and it is exact.** For any Bregman
divergence the conditional expectation is the unique optimal representative and the decomposition
is exact (**Banerjee, Guo & Wang 2005**, *On the optimality of conditional expectation as a Bregman
predictor*, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 51; **Banerjee, Merugu, Dhillon & Ghosh 2005**, *Clustering
with Bregman divergences*, JMLR 6). Specialised to `φ = A*` so that `D_{A*} = KL`:

```
E_i[ KL(p_i ‖ q) ]  =  E_i[ KL(p_i ‖ p̄) ]  +  KL( p̄ ‖ q )        for every q ∈ M
                       └── fibre-VARYING ──┘    └── DESCENDS ──┘
```

Checked: `max |LHS − RHS| = 5.7e-14` over 2000 random `q`; the within-cluster information is
`0.56922396` nats on the test cluster and **exactly `−0.0`** when the fibre is constant (B3, B4).

Three things follow, and the second is the real result:

1. **The identification the brief hoped for is correct.** The approximation error of the
   pushforward *is* the failure of constancy on fibres, quantified — and **Amari's generalised
   Pythagorean theorem is this decomposition**, because `D(p ‖ Π_M p)` depends only on `p` (varies
   on the fibre, does not descend) while `D(Π_M p ‖ q)` depends on `p` only through `Π_M p`
   (constant on the fibre, descends). With `φ = ‖·‖²` the same identity is the **law of total
   variance**. One theorem, three costumes.
2. **The route independently reproduces §3.5's boundary, which is the strongest corroboration
   available.** On the **conjugate** lane the "coarsening" has **singleton fibres** — the update is
   a translation, a bijection — so the within-fibre information is identically zero and the
   technique says nothing. That is §3.5's refutation of *"Bayes is a fast approximation of a
   geometric root"*, arrived at by a completely different road. On the **non-conjugate** lane the
   fibres are fat and the error is the formula above — which is exactly where §3.5 said the
   "optimization" label was legitimate. **A new method landing on the same boundary is evidence;
   a new method dissolving an inconvenient boundary would have been the warning sign.**
3. **It does NOT rescue the Gärdenfors half.** A coarsening yields a quotient, not a **convex
   region**, and §3.3's problem — convexity is affine and coordinate-relative — is untouched by
   variance. Q3 stays **ill-posed** on that half.

**And the route inherits the same two-fold ambiguity, from the same source — which is the deepest
thing in this addendum.** *"Measure over the cluster"* does not name one operation. The same four
members with the same weights have **two** KL barycentres, and they are far apart (B1):

| barycentre | closed form | what it is | where it already lives in the tree |
|---|---|---|---|
| `argmin_q E[KL(p_i ‖ q)]` (right-KL) | **moment average** — `(0.500000, 4.050000)` | m-projection | **EP moment matching**, `Message.fs`'s lineage (Minka 2001) |
| `argmin_q E[KL(q ‖ p_i)]` (left-KL) | **natural-parameter average** — `(0.947368, 1.052632)` | e-average | **NG4's `mix()`** — log-linear pooling, Genest 1984, already cited in `…-normal-gamma-…md` §5 |

Both match a direct numerical minimisation (B2). **These are two different coarsenings of one
cluster, both already implemented, in different files, under different names** — and a design that
says *"measure the change rate over the cluster"* has not yet said which. This is §3.3's e-versus-m
ambiguity arriving at the coarsening question by a different door, and it means the variance route
**does not dissolve the ill-posedness — it re-derives it**, and names the missing datum:

> **Fix which affine structure is canonical for the purpose. It is a modelling decision, not a
> geometric fact, and no amount of geometry will make it for you.**

### 10.5 What this changes upstream

- **§3's verdict is unchanged**, and is now corroborated by a second, independent technique.
- **§7.1's recommendation is strengthened**, not weakened: *root the metric, not the update.* The
  Bregman machinery is a statement about **which divergence you coarsen under** — a metric-layer
  choice — and it has no content at the affine layer, where the fibres are singletons.
- **One new obligation is filed** (§10.6): the descent theorem, the extensive/intensive split, and
  the Pythagorean-as-fibre-decomposition identification.
- **One design consequence, ready before the naming registry is built:** publish the
  within-cluster dispersion of the change-rate alongside the cluster's rate. A cluster reporting a
  rate without its within-fibre dispersion is a pushforward asserting a hypothesis it has not
  checked — and under `.claude/rules/toy-is-free-metered-must-be-earned.md` that is `unmetered`,
  not `metered`.

## 11. ADDENDUM TO THE ADDENDUM — is "a count is CRDT, a condition is CASPaxos" a theorem?

> Aaron, on §10's extensive/intensive split: *"for me **a count is CRDT** and **a condition is
> CASPaxos or CASRaft**-ish."*

**Verdict: directionally right, off by one refinement in *each* column — and the refinements are
the useful part. The two conditions are NOT equivalent: they are co-extensive on the examples and
separated by IDEMPOTENCE**, which belongs to the delivery channel rather than to the statistic
(§11.2). The correspondence is a **theorem** where it is stated over commutative monoids (§11.8)
and an **analogy that parts** where it is stated over counts. The left column understates what is needed (a count is a `CmRDT`, not a `CvRDT`);
the right column overstates it (**most intensive quantities need no consensus at all**). The
corrected invariant is **commutativity of the update**, and it is the *same* invariant on both
sides of the correspondence. The four-way agreement is **recorded design recognised in a new place**,
not a coincidence needing triage — checked, with counts, in §11.6.

Numbers from `docs/research/scripts/2026-08-23-geometry-as-root-extensive-crdt-verify.py`
(`ALL PASS`, exit 0).

### 11.1 The one distinction, stated once

> **Descent along a coarsening is free exactly when the aggregation is invariant under the
> symmetries of the fibre.** The fibre is *unordered* ⇒ the aggregation must be **commutative and
> associative**. The fibre arrives over a channel that may **duplicate** ⇒ additionally
> **idempotent**. The fibre is *ordered and the order matters* ⇒ you must **agree the order**, and
> agreeing an order is consensus.

Three tiers, one condition, and everything below is that sentence in a different vocabulary.

### 11.2 Left column — a raw count is a CmRDT, **not** a CvRDT

`+` on counts is commutative and associative and **not idempotent** (`x + x ≠ x`, C1). Those are
the **commutative monoid** axioms, not the **join-semilattice** axioms — the semilattice needs
exactly the one that fails. So:

- **extensive ⇒ concurrent operations commute ⇒ `CmRDT` (op-based).** True, unconditionally.
- **extensive ⇒ `CvRDT` (state-based).** **False** — the state is not a join-semilattice.

The standard repair is the **G-Counter**, and it is *not* a property of counting: it **re-indexes
the fibre by source**, merges with elementwise `max` (which *is* idempotent, C2), and recovers the
count only at **read** time as `Σ`. That is a **change of the carried object** — you decline to
quotient by replica identity — which in §10.1's language is *keeping a section of the coarsening*.

**And `src/Core/Crdt.fs` is the in-tree witness**, exactly this shape: `GCounter` is a `ZSet` keyed
by `replicaId`, `Merge` is elementwise `max`, `Value` is the sum. **The merge and the aggregation
are two different operations on two different objects**, which is precisely where the categorical
condition and the CRDT condition part company.

> **In-tree defect, found by this check.** `src/Core/Crdt.fs:9` reads *"DBSP Z-sets with integer
> weights are already a **signed-multiset join-semilattice** — commutative, associative, with an
> identity."* Those three axioms are the **commutative monoid**; a join-semilattice additionally
> requires **idempotence**, which `ZSet.add` does not have and cannot have (it is a group — it has
> *inverses*, which is the opposite of idempotent). **The code is correct and the comment names the
> wrong structure** — and the tell is that `GCounter.Merge` reaches for `max` precisely *because*
> `+` is not idempotent. Reported for the code phase, not filed as implementation.

**Idempotence is a property of DELIVERY, not of the statistic** (C3): redeliver one increment and
raw `+` reads `10` where the truth is `5`, while keyed-max reads `5`. This is the cleanest
statement of the boundary — commutativity/associativity are about **the meter** (does the answer
depend on how you grouped the fibre?), idempotence is about **the channel** (does it depend on how
many times you heard it?). Which is Aaron's own split from a different thread: *"reproducibility is
where the meter and the communications live."* Two conditions, two halves, and only the first is
what §10's pushforward asks for.

### 11.3 Right column — "intensive ⇒ consensus" is **false**, and the thermodynamics says why

The bigger correction. An intensive quantity that is a **ratio of two extensives** needs **no
coordination whatsoever**: carry both measures, merge both freely, divide at read.

| | value |
|---|---|
| `(sum, count)` merged across two uneven partitions, then divided | **6.2857142857** |
| direct global mean | **6.2857142857** — equal |
| average of the two partition averages | **7.7000000000** — wrong by **1.414** |

*"You cannot average averages"* is true and is **not** an argument for consensus; it is an argument
for **carrying the right pair**. And this is not a trick — it is the thermodynamic definition:
**an intensive quantity IS a ratio of extensives** (density = mass/volume, `T = ∂U/∂S`). So the
older anchor supplies the **repair**, not merely the vocabulary, which is what makes it a checked
anchor rather than a decorative one. Measure-theoretically it is the **Radon–Nikodym derivative**
`dν/dμ`: §10.1 said measures push forward freely, so *any* density recoverable from two
freely-pushing measures inherits that freedom.

**So what actually forces consensus?** **Non-commutativity** (C5): `f(g(s)) = 26 ≠ 23 = g(f(s))`
for a read-modify-write pair, and no merge function repairs an order-dependent result. **CAS is the
canonical non-commutative operation** — its result depends on what was already there — so
**CASPaxos (Rystsov 2018) is the right primitive, reached by the right reason.** Aaron's right-hand
box is correct; its label was.

### 11.4 The corrected table

| | free / wait-free | needs coordination |
|---|---|---|
| **categorical** | aggregation invariant under fibre symmetry | order-dependent aggregation |
| **algebraic** | commutative monoid (+ idempotent ⇒ semilattice) | non-commutative operation |
| **thermodynamic** | extensive, **or** intensive expressed as a ratio of extensives | a quantity with no ratio-of-extensives form |
| **distributed** | `CmRDT` (commuting ops); `CvRDT` after per-source keying | **CASPaxos / CASRaft** |
| **Zeta §2** | **wait-free** | requires coordination |

The one row that changed is the thermodynamic one, and changing it moves a large class of
quantities — every density, every rate, every mean — from the right column to the left.

### 11.5 The practical payoff survives, and gets a lower bound behind it

*"Prefer the extensive formulation because it is wait-free"* (manifesto §2) is **not** a style
preference. Merging a commutative aggregation is wait-free and available **under partition**
(Strong Eventual Consistency, Shapiro et al. 2011). Consensus is **impossible** in an asynchronous
system with a single crash fault (**Fischer, Lynch & Paterson 1985**) and unavailable under
partition (**Gilbert & Lynch 2002**). The gap is a **computability class**, not a message count.

**And the naming-registry consequence converges with a rule already resident.** A *rate* is
`Δcount / Δtime` — the denominator is a **duration**, and agreeing a duration is agreeing a clock,
which is exactly what
[`local-time-never-enters-the-shared-fold`](../../.claude/rules/local-time-never-enters-the-shared-fold.md)
forbids entering the shared fold. So:

> **Carry the count. Never carry the rate.** The count is extensive, merges wait-free, and contains
> no clock. Let the *reader* divide by an agreed phase interval. One design rule satisfying §10's
> pushforward condition and the local-time rule simultaneously, from the same argument — and
> derived from the math rather than imposed on it.

The §10 rider still stands and is now sharper: publish the **within-fibre dispersion** beside the
cluster's count, because that dispersion is what says whether the cluster merged a hub with a
satellite. Dispersion is itself a ratio of extensives (`Σx²`, `Σx`, `Σ1`), so it is **also
wait-free**. Nothing in the DV2.0 measurement needs consensus.

### 11.6 Recognition, not discovery — and the correction I am recording rather than hiding

My first draft of this section triaged the four-way agreement (categorical / algebraic /
thermodynamic / distributed) as a **dense resonance** needing an independence check, per
`.claude/rules/numerology-vs-number-theory.md`. **That applied the right rule to the wrong case.**

> Aaron: *"you don't remember this history — this is one of the **primary things we keep checking
> are correlated, over and over, since the project started**. It's **database and CRDT and DBSP
> oriented**. **Zeta since its conception is a distributed consensus algorithm that gracefully
> degrades to slower operations based on trust gradients.**"*

Checked at `cdc2227156` rather than taken on trust:

| measurement | count |
|---|---|
| files mentioning `CRDT` | **661** |
| files mentioning `DBSP` | **1628** |
| files carrying **both** | **208** |
| `trust gradient` / `gracefully degrades` | `docs/VISION.md`, `docs/PROVEN-CORE-MAP.md`, `docs/DECISIONS/`, four backlog rows, and `rules.bak/useful-output-is-evidence-not-authority.md` — the **L0–L4 absorption ladder**, Amara 3rd ferry, **2026-05-28** |

The rule says a dense resonance is a prompt to check independence. **Here the independence check has
been running since inception, across 208 files.** So the register is **recorded design recognised in
a new place**, not a coincidence requiring triage — and presenting it as evidence would have been
double-counting a commitment the project already made.

I am recording the correction instead of quietly rewriting, because that rule's own worked example
is that *an unlabelled coincidence promoted to a belief is the failure* — and an unlabelled
**correction** is the same defect with the sign flipped.

**What is actually new is small, and it is the part worth having:**

| | status at `cdc2227156` |
|---|---|
| the **architecture** — CRDT/DBSP correlation, graceful degradation on trust gradients | **old and pervasive.** 208 files; the ladder dates to 2026-05-28 |
| the **criterion** — extensive ⇒ wait-free, non-commutative ⇒ consensus | **absent.** `git grep -in "extensive.*intensive"` over `src/`, `docs/`, `.claude/` returns **only this document**; `git grep -in "needs consensus\|requires consensus\|degrade.*consensus"` over `src/` and `.claude/rules/` returns **nothing** |

> **The substrate has been making this call by judgement, and making it well, without a stated
> test.** The contribution is therefore neither a new architecture nor a new correspondence — it is
> a **decision procedure** for a choice that was already being made correctly by hand. The
> architecture being old is what makes the criterion worth writing down, not what makes it
> redundant.

### 11.7 The degradation tier — what the result is *for*

The operational statement is *"Zeta gracefully degrades to slower operations based on trust
gradients."* §10's descent condition is then not an analogy to a coordination requirement — in this
substrate it **selects the degradation tier**:

| statistic | merge | mode | cost | what the trust gradient decides |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **count** (extensive) | unconditional | **CRDT** | **wait-free** (§2) | nothing — always affordable |
| **ratio of counts** (density / rate / mean / variance) | unconditional, on the pair | **CRDT** | **wait-free** | nothing — §11.3 moved this row *down* |
| **order-dependent update** (a decision, a CAS, a canonical-name election) | none exists | **CASPaxos / CASRaft** | coordination | **whether you can afford the round** |
| duplicating channel, any of the above | per-source keying | **CvRDT** | free | orthogonal — costs no coordination |

**The §11.3 correction earns its keep exactly here.** *"Rate ⇒ consensus"* would have pushed every
density, rate, mean and variance onto the consensus tier. Because most intensive quantities are
**secretly a pair of extensive ones**, the criterion moves them back to wait-free — which is
strictly the right direction for an architecture whose stated goal is to degrade *as rarely as
possible*. A criterion that over-escalates is worse than no criterion, because it spends the
gradient's budget on work that never needed it.

**The procedure, in the form a designer can apply:**

1. Is the statistic a **count**? → wait-free CRDT. Done.
2. Is it a **ratio of counts**? → carry numerator and denominator as separate counts and divide at
   read. **Still wait-free.** Do not reach for consensus here.
3. Is the update **order-dependent**? → this is the **only** tier that needs CASPaxos/CASRaft, and
   the trust gradient decides whether the round is affordable.
4. Can the channel **duplicate**? → per-source keying (G-Counter). Orthogonal to 1–3, free.

Applied to the naming registry: per-agent change **counts** and their **dispersion** are tier 1–2
and need no coordination at all; only *deciding* something about a cluster — its canonical name,
its hub-or-satellite classification — reaches tier 3. **Registry measurement is wait-free;
registry adjudication is not**, and the line between them is now a test rather than a judgement
call.

*Register: the procedure is **derived** from §10's descent condition; the ladder it selects on is
**recorded design**; the mathematical tier boundaries are §11.8's `iff`.*

### 11.8 Routing

**Not a new work-item.** The precise half is folded into the existing descent item
`081M0R34AZY087G0R001H9N6YS` as **D4**, because it is the same theorem family and a sixth
investigation is not what the evidence asks for. The statement is precise enough to be worth Lean:

> An aggregation `⊕ : Multiset(X) → X` descends along **every** coarsening **iff** it factors
> through multiset equality — i.e. iff `(X, ⊕)` is a **commutative monoid**. It descends along
> every coarsening whose fibres arrive with **unknown multiplicity** **iff** it is additionally
> **idempotent** — i.e. iff `(X, ⊔)` is a **join-semilattice**.

Two tiers, an `iff` each, and they are **exactly** the `CmRDT` and `CvRDT` conditions of Shapiro et
al. — which is what upgrades the mapping from analogy to theorem in the one place where it is one,
and simultaneously names the place where it is not (§11.2). Short in Lean 4 (`Multiset`,
`Multiset.sum`, `Finset.sup`).

**Anchors added to `docs/PRIOR-ART-LIST.md`:** Shapiro–Preguiça–Baquero–Zawirski 2011 (the
CvRDT/CmRDT split and the semilattice condition — the anchor that **corrected** §11.2 rather than
confirming it); Rystsov 2018 (CASPaxos); Tolman 1917 (extensive/intensive); FLP 1985 and
Gilbert–Lynch 2002 (the cost). Beckman was already resident as REQUIRED READING.
