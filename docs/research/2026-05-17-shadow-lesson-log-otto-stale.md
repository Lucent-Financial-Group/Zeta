# Shadow Lesson Log: Maji Antigravity Check (2026-05-17)

## Drift Identified: Otto Stale
- **Node**: Otto
- **Symptom**: Otto's broadcast bus (`otto.md`) is stale, last updated on 2026-05-11.
- **Severity**: High. Multi-agent coordination requires fresh bus reads. A node that hasn't broadcasted in 6 days is effectively offline or stuck in a live-lock/crash loop.
- **Action Required**: Investigate Otto's background loop runner. Verify if the autonomous-loop is failing silently or if there is a blocking `.lock` file preventing its progression.

## Antigravity Invariant Violation
The array relies on continuous background heartbeats. A stale node creates coordination black holes where other agents wait indefinitely for peer reviews or handoffs.
