# Own harness — account logins, Ace + Zeta CLIs, GitHub tokens not `gh`

*2026-08-26. Operational status: research-grade absorb of a current-state
audit; the live pointer is
[`docs/trajectories/own-ai-harness/RESUME.md`](../trajectories/own-ai-harness/RESUME.md).
GOVERNANCE.md §33.*

Aaron 2026-08-26 asked for an account of the harness that is supposed to
do full-duplex streaming and CLI/tooling **only by calling our CLIs**,
never platform CLIs; an overarching plan to run all paid agents on it
with **account logins** (API keys secondary); GitHub tokens instead of
`gh`; Ace closing over dependencies; Zeta closing over source control
and filesystem. Paid accounts in daily use: grok, claude, openai,
manus, gemini, codex, kiro.

## The shape (target)

```text
  account login (device-code / PKCE) ──► ~/.config/zeta/auth/<persona>/<provider>.json
                                              │
                                              ▼
  model (SSE today, four-corner duplex as the general shape)
                                              │
                    closed tools (JSON, no TTY, no bash)
                         ┌────────────┴────────────┐
                         ▼                         ▼
                   Ace CLIs                    Zeta CLIs
                 (dependencies)          (git / fs / forge)
                         │                         │
              setup-realize / pins         LibGit2Sharp + GitHub REST
```

Chat-completions is the **degenerate projection** of the four-corner
interface (`docs/research/2026-07-04-the-four-corner-interface-…`).
Full duplex is the general form; HTTP request/response is the 2-corner
fill.

## Where we are

Two stacks, not one.

**Stack A — production.** `loop-tick` + `persona-registry.ts` spawn
vendor CLIs that already hold Aaron's sessions:

| Persona | CLI today |
|---|---|
| Otto, Soraya, Tariq | `claude -p --permission-mode auto` |
| Vera / Codex | `codex --approval-mode full-auto` |
| Alexa / Kiro | `kiro-cli chat --trust-all-tools` |
| Lior | `agy -p --dangerously-skip-permissions` |
| Riven | `cursor-agent --print --model grok-*` |
| Grok peer-call | native `grok` CLI |

Those CLIs bring **their** tools (bash, git, gh, Read, …). The harness
cannot refuse what does not flow through it
(`docs/research/2026-08-13-lessons-belong-in-the-harness-not-in-rules-…`).

**Stack B — our harness library** (`src/Core.TypeScript/model-backend/`).
Live for **ChatGPT subscription** (summon + closed `fs_*`/`db_*`,
2026-07-04) and **GitHub device login** (PRs #9549–#9551). Not what
`loop-tick` calls.

### Per-provider matrix

| Provider | Account login (ours) | Streaming | Tools on our harness | Fleet |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| openai / ChatGPT | wired (`openai-auth.ts`) | SSE `/codex/responses` | closed `ZETA_TOOLS` live | Vera still uses Codex CLI |
| codex | same ChatGPT account | Codex CLI stream | vendor tools | Vera/codex cells |
| github | wired (`github-auth.ts`) | n/a | n/a | factory still `spawnSync gh` |
| claude | none | vendor | vendor / observe `bash -c` | Otto/Soraya/Tariq |
| grok | none | vendor / Cursor | vendor | this session |
| gemini | none | vendor | vendor | Lior (`agy`) |
| kiro | none | vendor | `--trust-all-tools` | Alexa |
| manus | API key only | async task | Manus skills, not Zeta tools | not in loop registry |

Installer already **declares** some vendor cred paths
(`zeta-creds-manifest.ts`: gh-cli, claude, gemini, codex) so USB restore
can bake them. That is inheritance of vendor sessions, not our login.

### Ace (dependencies)

Shipped: DLC `ace.ts` (install/verify/list/sign/registry/lockfile),
`setup-realize.ts` (host toolchains, dogfooded by linux/macos setup +
several CI jobs), pinned Ollama/SMT artifacts (replaces `curl|sh` on
those two).

Not shipped: meta-PM (`ace-cli.ts` is a toy graph), `ace pull`, brew/apt
as Ace verbs, CLI-wide `--json` (only `list` on the real CLI), wrapping
npm/cargo/gh.

Agents still type `bun` / `mise` / `brew` / `curl`.

### Zeta (source control + filesystem)

Shipped: `zeta` F# exe over **LibGit2Sharp** (no `git` binary) + MCP
porcelain (`zeta_status/log/branch/checkout/commit/push/fetch`);
`github-login-cli.ts`; `ZetaExec` file seam in tests; DagFs as the
algebra.

Not the factory path: `GitHubAdapter` / `rest-push` / poll-pr-gate /
heartbeat flush all `spawnSync("gh")`. `push-with-retry` and
`changed-files` still exec `git`. `clis/Verbs.fs` (`sim mea cut …`) is
a different product (algebra verbs), mostly stubs.

ROADMAP item 1 **NO GIT CLI** is unmet.

### Full duplex

`duplex-transport.ts` (in-process queues), `web-socket-endpoint.ts`,
`multiplexed-duplex-transport.ts` exist and are tested. Vendor APIs we
talk to are still half-duplex HTTP/SSE. Interrupt between turns, not
mid-token, until a provider's wire can carry the feedback corners.

## Gaps (ranked)

1. Production loops do not call `summon` / `runToolLoop`.
2. Five LLM providers have no `AuthProvider`.
3. GitHub **login** is ours; GitHub **work** is still `gh`.
4. Closed tool surface is not Ace+Zeta and is not what the fleet uses.
5. Token store is per-provider, not per-persona (manifest says
   `personaScoped: true` for the AIs).
6. Ace/Zeta CLIs are not an AI-friendly contract (JSON-out, structured
   errors, no TTY) across every verb.
7. Full duplex does not wrap vendor streams.
8. Dogfood ledger did not track "paid agents on our harness" until
   Tier 0 (same day as this absorb).

## Roadmap

Umbrella `081M100RB97087G0R0008EAAY7`.

| Phase | Workitem | Dogfood signal |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | roster + `zeta-login` CLI (this change) | `zeta-login list --json` is the declared set |
| 1 | AuthProviders for claude/grok/gemini/kiro/manus | `081M100RH29087G0R0031HHGJ0` |
| 1b | ForgeHost HTTP + stored token, no `gh` | `081M100RB9Z087G0R000GWY1MM` |
| 2 | Closed tools = Ace + Zeta verbs | `081M100RH3Q087G0R0018X4RSJ` |
| 3 | `loop-tick` default `mux-duplex` | `081M100RH30087G0R003YXHQ12` |

API keys stay a **secondary** path (Manus Keychain today). Account
login is the primary for every row that can do OAuth.

## Slice 0 (landed with this absorb)

`src/Core.TypeScript/model-backend/provider-roster.ts` is the data.
Adding a provider is a roster edit, not a new CLI. `zeta-login` runs
device flow for `github` and `openai`/`codex`; anything else fails
closed with `{ error: "no-auth-provider", next: "081M100RH29087G0R0031HHGJ0" }`.
