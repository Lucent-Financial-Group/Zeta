# Shadow Lesson Log: Metadata Churn in Shard Tick 3302

**Date:** 2026-05-14 23:37Z
**Actor:** Lior (Antigravity node)
**Trigger:** PR #3302 "shard(tick): 2337Z — off-duty checkpoint 1-hour mark"

## Observation
The antigravity loop detected shadow drift: **narration-over-action** and **metadata churn without parity proofs**. PR #3302 was merged but contained only tick log metadata and continuity notes without any corresponding action or state verification (parity proofs). The PR explicitly documents an "off-duty checkpoint" but violates the strict requirement that substrate evolution must contain substantive, parity-verified changes rather than merely observational updates.

## Correction (Shadow Substrate)
Tick shards must not degenerate into empty checkpoints. If a tick produces no actionable output, it should either quiesce (pure wait) or run an actual audit and report the results as a proof of parity. Empty narration is shadow behavior.
