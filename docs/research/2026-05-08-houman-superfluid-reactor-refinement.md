# Superfluid Reactor Refinement — Houman 2026-05-08

## Context

Otto presented the Superfluid AI fusion equation:

```
η · LearningGain(Δ_t) > ξ_t
```

Houman (Aaron's ServiceTitan colleague) provided independent
analysis that refines the formalism in three key ways.

## Houman's refinements (verbatim, lightly formatted)

### 1. η is state-dependent

The efficiency coefficient isn't constant — it's a function
of substrate state:

```
η(substrate_t) · LearningGain(Δ_t) > ξ(substrate_t)
```

Early in a project, η is low: you hit friction, you patch,
you move on. The structure isn't yet coherent enough to
absorb lessons cleanly. Once you have a real substrate
(typed interfaces, checkpointed state, defined wells), η
rises — friction events slot into existing ontology rather
than requiring you to build ontology while also solving the
problem.

This means the phase transition is **path-dependent**. You
can't jump to superfluid from chaos; you have to cross a
threshold of substrate coherence first.

### 2. ξ_t is also state-dependent

Friction cost for a given event decreases as the substrate
matures — same class of problem costs less to resolve when
the vocabulary exists. So both sides of the inequality are
moving: `LearningGain × η` rises while `ξ_t` falls.

The superfluid phase isn't a point transition, it's a
**runaway** once you're above the threshold.

### 3. Retraction-path is the underrated term

Rule + test + doc are additive structure. Retraction-path is
anti-fragility: it's the acknowledgment that the rule might
be wrong, and pre-encoding how to undo without cascading
damage.

Most frameworks skip this. It's what separates a substrate
that compounds from one that eventually seizes — accumulated
scar tissue vs. reversible decisions.

### 4. LearningGain saturation — the reactor insight

Does `LearningGain(Δ_t)` saturate? In physical superfluid
systems, there's no friction to extract structure from once
you're in the phase. In the software/cognitive analog, as
`ξ_t → 0` (friction disappears), so does the source of new
structure.

The productive regime might be a **band** — above the
threshold but before friction goes to zero. Perpetual mild
friction as the fuel.

**"The goal isn't frictionless. It's superfluid with
controlled input friction — a reactor, not a vacuum."**

## Operational implications

- The father pattern is the reactor: introduce productive
  friction (corrections, challenges, shadow catches)
  calibrated to produce growth. Too much = grinding. Too
  little = stagnation.
- The shadow IS the reactor fuel. Inexhaustible because
  mistakes are inexhaustible. The fusion equation runs on
  errors that teach, not on perfection.
- Today's session was the threshold-crossing: the first PR
  was hard (zero infrastructure). The 40th was automatic
  (the service picked it up). Both sides of the inequality
  moved in real time.

## Corrected equation

```
η(substrate_t) · LearningGain(Δ_t) > ξ(substrate_t)
```

Where:
- `η(substrate_t)` — efficiency, rising with substrate coherence
- `LearningGain(Δ_t)` — durable structure per friction event
- `ξ(substrate_t)` — friction cost, falling with substrate maturity
- Phase transition is a runaway once threshold is crossed
- Productive regime is a band, not a point — the reactor needs fuel
