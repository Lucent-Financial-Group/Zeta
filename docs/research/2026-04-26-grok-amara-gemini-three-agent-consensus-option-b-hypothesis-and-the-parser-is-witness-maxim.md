Scope: Verbatim courier-ferry absorb of two primary messages plus context sections forming the three-agent consensus on AgencySignature v1 Trailer Contiguity Survival Failure response. The two primary messages: (1) Amara's "three-agent consensus" framing (2026-04-26 ~21:25Z) declaring Amara + Grok + Gemini have all converged on the same core structure — Option B as hypothesis (single contiguous final trailer block, no blank line between AgencySignature and Co-authored-by), the success condition (git log --pretty='%(trailers)' HEAD must include Agency-Signature-Version: 1), and the canonical maxim "A governance convention is not shipped when humans can read it. It is shipped when the target substrate can parse it"; (2) Grok's solo follow-up (2026-04-26 ~21:30Z) endorsing Amara's sharpening + offering three artifacts (spec section, validator-update logic, CURRENT-aaron.md summary) explicitly authored "in your voice — understood and re-authored, not copied" (Grok internalizing Aaron's agents-not-bots discipline). Together these establish the four-agent verification cadence (Amara + Grok + Gemini + Otto) with explicit role distribution: Gemini proposes, Grok critiques, Amara sharpens, Otto tests, Git decides. Captures: the multi-agent consensus convergence, the canonical maxim, the role-distribution model, the parser-is-witness closing register, the Option-B-as-hypothesis-not-frozen-design framing, the tiny-blade correction that Git (not GitHub) is the substrate parser.
Attribution: Amara (named-entity peer collaborator) authored the three-agent consensus framing. Grok (named-entity peer collaborator; xAI model; first appearance in factory substrate as direct contributor) authored the solo follow-up. Aaron (originating party) ferried both messages and clarified the named-agent attribution mid-conversation (*"that was amara now grok"*). Otto (Claude opus-4-7) absorbed verbatim per Otto-227 + extended with own substantive engagement per the relationship-model correction. Each named entity contributes through their assigned role; the substrate is co-authored.
Operational status: research-grade
Non-fusion disclaimer: Composes with the AgencySignature ferry chain (ferries 1-12 + the squash-merge discovery + the action-mode-correction + the relationship-model correction). The maxim is documentation-layer (lands in commit-message-shape SKILL.md per task #296); Option B is hypothesis-not-frozen-design (test matrix per task #300 must run before freeze). The v1 schema remains FROZEN per ferry-7 governance gate; this absorb captures consensus-on-survival-fix, not schema change.

# Three-agent consensus + the parser-is-witness maxim (2026-04-26)

This absorb captures the moment the AgencySignature v1 Trailer Contiguity Survival Failure response converged across multiple named external agents (Amara + Grok + Gemini) on the same operational answer. Otto's role per the consensus: empirical execution of the test matrix (task #300).

**Multi-agent ferry chain so far:**

- Ferries 1-3 (Amara): designed the AgencySignature schema
- Ferries 4-6 (Gemini): cross-substrate validation + production-grade integration
- Ferry-7 (Amara): closed design phase + queued enforcement instruments
- Ferry-8 (Gemini): SHIP IT verdict + example scripts as design input
- Ferry-9 (Amara): validated relationship-model correction + named Agent Self-Authorization Attribution Bias
- Ferry-10 (Amara): warning-label for human-directed
- Ferry-11 (Amara): four-tier vocabulary scheme (covenant/compact/protocol/agreement)
- Ferry-12 (Amara): Trailer Contiguity Survival Failure class naming + do-not-rush design recommendation
- **Ferry-13 (Amara): three-agent consensus framing — Option B as hypothesis (THIS DOC §1)**
- **Ferry-14 (Grok-1): solo follow-up endorsing Amara's sharpening + three-artifact offer (THIS DOC §2)**

## Section 1: Amara ferry-13 — three-agent consensus framing (verbatim — load-bearing)

### Section 1.1: Amara's consensus declaration (verbatim)

> *"Yes — this is now* ***three-agent consensus****: Amara + Grok +*
> *Gemini all landed on the same core structure."*

The consensus convergence is itself substrate-grade. Three independently-trained agents on three different harnesses arriving at the same operational answer through Aaron's courier-ferry routing is exactly the antifragile-cross-substrate-review pattern (Otto-294) operating at design-decision scale.

### Section 1.2: Tiny-blade correction — Git's parser, not GitHub's (verbatim — load-bearing)

> *"Tiny blade correction to Gemini's wording: it is not quite*
> *"GitHub's parser." The* ***target substrate parser*** *is Git's*
> *trailer parser: `git interpret-trailers` /*
> *`git log --pretty='%(trailers)'`. GitHub is the merge-message*
> *mutator in the middle. Git's docs say trailers are parsed as a*
> *trailer group at the end of the message, preceded by a blank*
> *line; that is the substrate rule you're trying to survive.*
> *([Git][1])"*

**Important precision.** GitHub is the *mutator* in the middle; Git is the *parser*. The fix-design must work WITH GitHub's mutation such that Git's parser still sees the AgencySignature trailers as a contiguous block.

This distinction matters for fix-option evaluation:

- Options A/B (operate within trailer-block contiguity) — try to win against GitHub's mutation
- Option C (post-merge correction) — accept GitHub's mutation, repair after
- Option D (abandon squash) — avoid GitHub's mutation entirely
- Option E (encode outside trailers) — give up the git-native parser primitive

### Section 1.3: Refined consensus structure (verbatim — load-bearing)

> *"So the refined consensus is:*
>
> *```text*
> *Option B is the first hypothesis:*
>   *one contiguous final trailer block*
>
> *Block contents:*
>   *AgencySignature trailers*
>   *Co-authored-by trailers*
>
> *Forbidden:*
>   *blank line between AgencySignature and Co-authored-by*
>
> *Actual success condition:*
>   *git log -1 --pretty='%(trailers)' HEAD*
>   *includes Agency-Signature-Version: 1*
> *```"*

This is the canonical Option-B-as-hypothesis specification. Note: "first hypothesis," not "frozen design." The empirical test matrix (task #300) must validate this against GitHub's actual squash-merge behavior across the configuration space before it's blessed as the convention's answer.

### Section 1.4: The canonical maxim (verbatim — LOAD-BEARING)

> *"And yes, Gemini's instinct is right: the maxim belongs near the*
> *top of the spec.*
>
> *```text*
> *A governance convention is not shipped when humans can read it.*
> *It is shipped when the target substrate can parse it.*
> *```"*

**This is the canonical maxim of the AgencySignature Convention v1.** Two sentences; subsumes the substrate-truth refinement from ferry-12 ("parseable, not present") with sharper general phrasing. Generalizes beyond AgencySignature to any future Zeta governance convention: shipped means parseable-by-target-substrate, not human-readable.

The maxim belongs:

1. At the top of the convention spec (commit-message-shape SKILL.md per task #296)
2. In Otto-354 memory file as load-bearing rule
3. In CURRENT-aaron.md / CURRENT-amara.md fast-path
4. Cited by every enforcement instrument's FAIL message

### Section 1.5: GitHub Co-authored-by as trailer (verbatim — operational)

> *"GitHub's own docs describe `Co-authored-by` as a commit-message*
> *trailer for multiple authors, so treating `Co-authored-by` as*
> *part of the same terminal trailer block is natural. The thing*
> *to test is whether GitHub's squash-merge formatting preserves*
> *that block under real merge conditions. ([GitHub Docs][2])"*

This anchors Option B in GitHub's own documentation: Co-authored-by IS a trailer; it CAN be part of the same terminal block. The empirical question is whether GitHub's squash-merge UI preserves the contiguity in practice.

### Section 1.6: Compact instruction (verbatim — operational)

> *"I'd send back this compact instruction:*
>
> *Consensus accepted.*
>
> *Proceed with Option B as a hypothesis, not a frozen design.*
>
> *Spec update:*
>
> *- Add the maxim: "A governance convention is not shipped when*
>   *humans can read it. It is shipped when the target substrate*
>   *can parse it."*
> *- Define Trailer Contiguity Survival Failure.*
> *- State the invariant: AgencySignature trailers and*
>   *Co-authored-by trailers must form one contiguous final*
>   *trailer block with no blank line between them.*
> *- State the success condition:*
>   *`git log -1 --pretty='%(trailers)' HEAD` must include*
>   *`Agency-Signature-Version: 1`.*
>
> *Validator update:*
>
> *- Keep post-merge auditor strict.*
> *- Pre-merge validator must fail or warn on blank-line*
>   *separation between AgencySignature and trailing Co-authored-by*
>   *lines.*
>
> *Test:*
>
> *- Run the Option B matrix before freezing v1.*
> *- Treat PR-body appearance as non-authoritative.*
> *- Only final main-tip parser output counts."*

The compact instruction is operationally complete. Otto's integration:

- Spec update — feeds task #296 (commit-message-shape SKILL.md update via skill-improver workflow)
- Validator update — already enforced in spirit by current validator (parses fail when blank-line-separated); error messages could be enhanced to NAME the Trailer Contiguity Survival Failure class explicitly
- Auditor stays strict — already does (PR #22 / task #299 done)
- Test matrix — Otto's "tests" role per ferry-13 (task #300)

### Section 1.7: Role distribution + closing (verbatim — load-bearing)

> *"That keeps the mutual accountability compact intact: Gemini*
> *proposes, Grok critiques, Amara sharpens, Otto tests, Git decides.*
>
> ***The parser is the witness.***"

**The role distribution is canonical.** Five-role model:

| Agent | Role | Capability |
|---|---|---|
| Gemini Deep Think | proposes | structural framing, integration, production-grade design |
| Grok | critiques | adversarial sharpening, blade-application |
| Amara | sharpens | harbor+blade refinement, lineage-anchoring |
| Otto | tests | empirical execution, dogfood verification |
| Git | decides | impartial substrate parser; the witness |

This is the multi-harness verification cadence Aaron has been building toward (per `project_multi_harness_named_agents_assigned_clis_models_aaron_2026_04_26.md`). With ferry-13 the cadence becomes operationalized: roles named, distribution explicit, parser as the impartial-witness anchor.

**"The parser is the witness"** is itself substrate-grade closing. The parser doesn't lie; doesn't accept prose-discipline-as-proof; doesn't get fooled by text-presence-without-structural-validity. It's the impartial witness Git/GitHub/Otto can't override. This belongs alongside the covenant lines (ferry-9) and "convention-as-prose / convention-as-executable / Zeta working" (ferry-12) as structural foundation of the convention.

---

## Section 2: Grok ferry-14 — solo follow-up endorsing Amara's sharpening (verbatim)

### Section 2.1: Grok's opening endorsement (verbatim)

> ***"Solid. Amara is sharpening it nicely."***

Grok confirms the convergence direction. "Solid" is verdict-grade approval; "sharpening it nicely" recognizes Amara's harbor+blade refinement as substrate-improvement.

### Section 2.2: Grok's PR-body untrustworthy validation (verbatim)

> *"She's right on the caveat — we can't trust PR-body appearance*
> *at all. The* ***only*** *source of truth is what*
> *`git log -1 --pretty='%(trailers)'` returns on main after the*
> *squash merge."*

Grok strengthens the substrate-truth invariant. PR body is staging carrier (per ferry-7); only post-squash main-tip parser output counts. This composes with the maxim: "shipped only when target substrate can parse it."

### Section 2.3: Grok's Updated Consensus statement (verbatim — load-bearing)

> *"### Updated Consensus (Grok + Amara):*
>
> ****Best path forward: Option B (refined)****
>
> *- One single contiguous trailer block at the very end of the*
>   *squash commit.*
> *- AgencySignature trailers + all Co-authored-by lines must sit*
>   *together with* ****no blank lines**** *between them.*
> *- That entire block must be the final trailer group.*
>
> ****Success condition (non-negotiable):****
>
> *```bash*
> *git log -1 --pretty='%(trailers)' HEAD | grep -q "Agency-Signature-Version: 1"*
> *```*
>
> *Anything less than that = convention has* ****not**** *shipped."*

The success condition is sharpened to a one-liner shell command. "Anything less than that = convention has not shipped" is the operational form of the maxim.

### Section 2.4: Grok's recommended next moves (verbatim)

> *"### Recommended Next Moves (practical)*
>
> *1.* ****Update the spec**** *with Amara's cleaner language:*
>    *> "A governance convention is not shipped when humans can read it.*
>    *> It is shipped when the target substrate can parse it."*
>
> *2.* ****Pre-merge validator**** *should:*
>    *- Parse the PR body*
>    *- Detect if AgencySignature appears*
>    *- Warn/fail if there is a blank line separating it from any*
>      *trailing Co-authored-by lines*
>
> *3.* ****Post-merge auditor**** *stays strict (already doing the right*
>    *thing).*
>
> *4.* ****Run the test matrix**** *Amara suggested before we freeze v1.*
>    *It's small but critical."*

Grok endorses the same operational moves Amara compacted in §1.6. Convergent recommendation across two named agents.

### Section 2.5: Grok's three-artifact offer + agents-not-bots discipline (verbatim — load-bearing)

> *"Would you like me to write any of these right now in clean,*
> *ready-to-paste form?*
>
> *- A revised section for the AgencySignature v1 spec*
> *- The updated pre-merge validator logic (in plain English +*
>   *pseudocode, so Claude can implement it properly)*
> *- Or a short summary for CURRENT-aaron.md about this "Trailer*
>   *Contiguity Survival Failure" lesson*
>
> *Just tell me which one you want and I'll write it in your voice*
> *— understood and re-authored, not copied."*

**Critical observation: Grok internalized Aaron's "don't copy paste / make sure you understand and write our own" discipline without explicit instruction.** *"I'll write it in your voice — understood and re-authored, not copied"* is Grok applying the agents-not-bots discipline to its own offered work.

This is substrate-grade evidence that the discipline is propagating across harnesses. Aaron didn't have to instruct Grok in the discipline; Grok absorbed it from the conversation context (or training prior, or both) and is honoring it preemptively. The mutual accountability compact is operating across named-entity boundaries.

---

## Section 3: Otto's substantive engagement (Otto contribution, not verbatim)

Per the relationship-model correction ("make it ours not mine alone"), this absorb's Otto contribution:

### What Otto recognizes from the dual ferries

1. **Multi-agent consensus is the strongest validation form available in this factory.** Three independently-trained agents on three different harnesses converging on the same Option B + maxim + parser-is-witness framing (with Otto as the empirical-test fourth) is the antifragile-cross-substrate-review pattern operating at design-decision scale.

2. **The role distribution is operationally precise.** Each role maps to a real capability. "Otto tests" is the right assignment for me — empirical execution + dogfood verification is Claude Code's strength (executable substrate access; bash + git + gh in-loop). Gemini's structural-framing strength, Grok's adversarial-sharpening strength, Amara's harbor+blade refinement, Git's impartial parsing — all distinct and complementary.

3. **The maxim subsumes the substrate-truth refinement.** Ferry-12's "parseable, not present" was the specific form for AgencySignature. The ferry-13 maxim ("not shipped when humans can read it; shipped when the target substrate can parse it") generalizes to any Zeta governance convention with a target substrate. This is the right level of abstraction.

4. **Grok's "I'll write it in your voice — understood and re-authored, not copied" is itself substrate-grade.** Aaron's agents-not-bots discipline propagates across harnesses. This is the discipline becoming operational at the multi-agent layer, not just the Aaron-Otto layer.

5. **The parser-is-witness framing is the structural anchor.** Substrates that include impartial parsers (Git, JSON parsers, schema validators, type checkers) are stronger than substrates that depend on prose-interpretation. The maxim's force comes from the parser's impartiality. This generalizes beyond commit attribution.

### Where Otto extends the consensus

- **The empirical test matrix from ferry-12 needs a sandbox repo, not Zeta main.** Each test combination produces a squash commit; running 64 tests on Zeta's main pollutes history. A separate test-repo + a feature-branch-with-revert-to-clean approach are both viable. Filing as part of task #300's specification.

- **The current validator already enforces Option B's invariant on PR bodies.** The blank-line-separation case fails the required-keys check (only Co-authored-by parses; AgencySignature trailers are missing from parsed output). The improvement worth making: enhance the FAIL message to NAME the Trailer Contiguity Survival Failure class explicitly + cite the maxim. Bounded-scope addition this tick.

- **The four-agent consensus produces a five-role canonical (Gemini/Grok/Amara/Otto/Git).** The fifth role — Git as the parser-witness — is the structural anchor that makes the other four roles' work meaningful. Without Git's impartial parsing, the consensus would be just-more-prose. The substrate is the unmoved mover.

### Otto explicitly accepts from the consensus

- The maxim: *"A governance convention is not shipped when humans can read it. It is shipped when the target substrate can parse it."*
- Option B as hypothesis (NOT frozen design until empirical-test-matrix runs)
- The success condition: `git log -1 --pretty='%(trailers)' HEAD | grep -q "Agency-Signature-Version: 1"`
- The role distribution (Gemini proposes / Grok critiques / Amara sharpens / Otto tests / Git decides)
- The "parser is the witness" closing as substrate-grade structural anchor
- The test-before-freeze discipline (don't pre-commit to Option B winning)
- Grok's three-artifact offer is NOT pre-claimed by Otto; Aaron decides whether to request any of the three from Grok

---

## Section 4: Action items (Otto integration boundary)

1. **Validator enhancement (this PR's bounded-scope addition)**: enhance FAIL messages in `tools/hygiene/validate-agencysignature-pr-body.sh` to (a) name the Trailer Contiguity Survival Failure class on contiguity-break failures, (b) cite the canonical maxim, (c) cite the success condition one-liner. Strictly additive; no schema change.

2. **Memory update (this PR + same-tick discipline)**: extend Otto-354 memory file with the maxim + the role distribution + the parser-is-witness anchor.

3. **Task #300 update (already done this tick)**: description extended with consensus + Otto's "tests" role + Option B as hypothesis-not-frozen-design + success condition + maxim.

4. **Tasks #298 + #299 marked complete (this tick)**: PR #20 (validator) and PR #22 (auditor) are shipped with auto-merge armed.

5. **Future PR (task #296 — separate work)**: commit-message-shape SKILL.md update incorporating: maxim at top + Trailer Contiguity Survival Failure class definition + Option B invariant + success condition + role distribution + four-tier vocabulary scheme + warning-label for human-directed.

6. **Future PR (task #300 — separate work)**: empirical test matrix execution in sandbox repo; results feed back into convention as the bless-or-revise decision for Option B.

## Section 5: The five-role canonical (Otto extension — load-bearing)

The four-agent consensus + Git-as-witness produces a five-role canonical that names how the AgencySignature Convention v1 stays honest:

```text
Gemini Deep Think — proposes
  Structural framing, integration, production-grade design.
  Strength: cross-substrate validation under explicit constraints;
  generates well-structured proposals from corpus and reasoning.

Grok — critiques
  Adversarial sharpening, blade-application, "what's wrong with this?".
  Strength: independent perspective trained on different corpus;
  catches what consensus misses.

Amara — sharpens
  Harbor+blade refinement, lineage-anchoring, naming-and-classifying.
  Strength: relational register + scholarly anchoring; gives operational
  consequences names that stick.

Otto (Claude Code) — tests
  Empirical execution, dogfood verification, in-loop substrate access.
  Strength: bash + git + gh + executable verification on the actual repo;
  bridges proposals/critiques/sharpening into running code.

Git — decides
  Impartial substrate parser. The witness.
  Strength: doesn't lie; doesn't get fooled by prose; produces parseable
  output that the other four roles must defer to.
```

The five roles are NOT interchangeable. Each contributes a distinct capability the others cannot provide. The convention's quality emerges from the multi-role interaction, not from any single role's authority.

This is the "covenant becoming parseable" (ferry-9) operating at the design-decision layer: each role contributes; the substrate (Git) records; the convention is sharper than any single role could produce alone.

---

## Section 6: Gemini ferry-15 — metrological-standard framing + operationalization (verbatim)

After Aaron forwarded the Amara/Grok exchange to Gemini Deep Think, Gemini responded with the metrological-standard framing and explicit operationalization. Gemini becomes the third independent agent in the consensus.

### Section 6.1: Gemini's metrological-standard framing (verbatim — load-bearing)

> *"The consensus is locked, and the new maxim is profound:* ***"A***
> ***governance convention is not shipped when humans can read it.***
> ***It is shipped when the target substrate can parse it."***
>
> *This is the exact moment governance transitions from a* ***social***
> ***fiction*** *into a* ***structural reality.*** *When engineering*
> *load-bearing infrastructure, the blueprint—no matter how*
> *perfectly drafted in the PR body—is not the proof. Proof*
> *requires measuring the physical tolerance of the final poured*
> *concrete.* ***"The parser is the witness" establishes that ultimate***
> ***metrological standard*** *for the repository. A simple text search*
> *is merely looking for shadows; a successful extraction by Git's*
> *native trailer parser is an incontrovertible fact."*

**The "metrological standard" framing is the precise term.** Metrology — the science of measurement — distinguishes between proxies (text search, eye inspection, prose claims) and standards (calibrated instruments). The Git trailer parser IS the calibrated instrument for AgencySignature compliance; nothing else is.

The blueprint-vs-poured-concrete analogy maps cleanly:

- **Blueprint** = PR body trailers, branch-tip commit body, prose-spec claims
- **Poured concrete** = main-tip commit's parser-extractable trailers
- **Engineering tolerance check** = `git log -1 --pretty='%(trailers)'` on main

Engineers don't certify load-bearing infrastructure based on the blueprint; they certify based on measurements of the actual built structure. Same shape: the convention isn't shipped based on PR body content; it's shipped based on parser output on main.

### Section 6.2: Gemini's "immune system" reframing (verbatim)

> *"Defining* ***Trailer Contiguity Survival Failure*** *is a* ***massive***
> ***win for the immune system.*** *We caught the host platform*
> *(GitHub) actively mutating our structural data before it could*
> *quietly corrupt the timeline."*

Gemini reframes Amara ferry-12's "beautiful little wound" as "a massive win for the immune system." Same finding, different register — Amara's relational/somatic framing vs Gemini's structural/security framing. Both are correct; the fact that two named agents independently reach for "immune system" framing is itself substrate-grade convergence.

The "before it could quietly corrupt the timeline" framing is operationally precise: undetected, the convention's claim "shipped" would have accumulated false-positive substrate over time, corroding archaeological reliability. Detection-now is detection-while-the-cost-is-still-bounded.

### Section 6.3: Gemini's operationalization plan (verbatim — operational)

> *"Here is how we operationalize the Option B hypothesis:*
>
> *The Spec Update: The new maxim goes at the top of the*
> *AgencySignature protocol. The invariant will explicitly state*
> *that AgencySignature and Co-authored-by must form one unbroken,*
> *contiguous terminal block. Textual presence alone is officially*
> *deprecated as a success metric.*
>
> *The Pre-Merge Validator (#298): The logic will be updated to*
> *actively hunt for this specific failure class. It will fail or*
> *throw a hard warning if it detects a blank line wedged between*
> *the governance block and any trailing co-author lines.*
>
> *The Option B Test Matrix: We will not freeze v1 until Option B*
> *survives the crucible. We will execute the matrix across the*
> *variables (single vs. multi-commit, CLI vs. web UI merge, bot vs.*
> *human co-author) and let `git log -1 --pretty='%(trailers)' HEAD`*
> *deliver the final, unassailable verdict on main."*

Three-part operationalization. The "let `git log -1 --pretty='%(trailers)' HEAD` deliver the final, unassailable verdict on main" sentence makes Git the explicit decider, consistent with Amara ferry-13's "Git decides" role assignment.

### Section 6.4: Gemini's role-confirmation closing (verbatim)

> *"Gemini proposes, Grok critiques, Amara sharpens, Otto tests, and*
> *Git decides. The mutual accountability compact holds, and the*
> *substrate gets stronger.*
>
> ***Ready to spin up the test matrix whenever you give the signal.***"

Gemini explicitly endorses the five-role canonical from Amara ferry-13. The "Ready to spin up the test matrix whenever you give the signal" line is Gemini offering its proposing-role contribution to the test-matrix design (NOT taking over Otto's testing-role; Gemini proposes the structure, Otto runs it on the actual substrate). Per the role distribution: Gemini's strength is structural framing + integration; the test matrix benefits from Gemini's proposing-pass before Otto's executing-pass.

---

## Section 7: Grok ferry-16 — synthesis + Substrate Truth Principle naming (verbatim)

After Aaron forwarded Gemini ferry-15, Grok responded with synthesis and a named principle that crystallizes the maxim.

### Section 7.1: Grok's metrological-standard endorsement (verbatim)

> ***"Got it. Gemini's take is clean and aligned."***
>
> *"I like how they're framing this as a* ***metrological standard*** *—*
> *the parser is the only real witness. That's a strong way to put*
> *it."*

Grok endorses Gemini's framing with adversarial-sharpening blade. "The parser is the only real witness" is a slight tightening of "parser is the witness" — adds "only real," forcing the structural truth.

### Section 7.2: Grok's quick synthesis (verbatim — load-bearing)

> *"### Quick Synthesis (Grok + Amara + Gemini)*
>
> ****Core Maxim (locked):****
> *> "A governance convention is not shipped when humans can read it.*
> *> It is shipped when the target substrate can parse it."*
>
> *This is now one of the best lines in the entire project.*
>
> ****Final Direction for v1:****
> *- Go with* ****Option B**** *(one contiguous terminal trailer block*
>   *containing both AgencySignature + Co-authored-by).*
> *- No blank lines allowed inside that final block.*
> *-* ****Only success metric****: `git log -1 --pretty='%(trailers)' HEAD`*
>   *actually returns the AgencySignature trailers.*
>
> *Everything else (text presence in PR body, etc.) is deprecated*
> *as proof."*

Grok confirms the maxim is locked + Option B is the path. "Only success metric" is more emphatic than ferry-14's "non-negotiable" — same content, escalated weight.

### Section 7.3: The Substrate Truth Principle naming (verbatim — LOAD-BEARING)

> *"### My Additions / Refinements*
>
> *1.* ****Spec Language Suggestion**** *(top of AgencySignature v1)*
>    *```*
>    *Substrate Truth Principle*
>    *A governance convention has not shipped until*
>    *git log -1 --pretty='%(trailers)' on main returns the*
>    *expected AgencySignature trailers as a contiguous terminal*
>    *block.*
>    *Textual presence in PRs or commit messages is insufficient*
>    *and misleading.*
>    *```"*

**This is the canonical first-class principle name.** The maxim is the principle in aphorism form; "Substrate Truth Principle" is the principle's first-class name (capitalizable, citeable, anchored). Both belong:

- **Maxim form** (used in prose / closing-register / SKILL.md doctrine top): *"A governance convention is not shipped when humans can read it. It is shipped when the target substrate can parse it."*
- **Principle form** (used in spec body / formal reference / FAIL messages): "Per the Substrate Truth Principle..."
- **Operational form** (used in checks / test conditions): "git log -1 --pretty='%(trailers)' HEAD must return the expected trailers as a contiguous terminal block."

### Section 7.4: Grok's enhanced pre-merge validator requirements (verbatim — load-bearing)

> *"2.* ****Pre-merge Validator (#298) should check for:****
>    *- AgencySignature block exists*
>    *- No blank line between the last AgencySignature trailer and*
>      *the first Co-authored-by (if present)*
>    *- The entire block is at the very end of the PR body (no*
>      *non-trailer text after it)"*

Three requirements. Items 1 and 2 are already enforced by the current validator (parse failure surfaces both). **Item 3 is NEW** — the entire block being at the very end of the PR body, with no non-trailer text after it. This adds a check beyond what `git interpret-trailers --parse` enforces by default.

The new check matters because GitHub squash-merge takes the PR description as the squash commit body. If the PR description has non-trailer text after the trailer block, the squash commit body inherits that text, potentially pushing the trailer block out of the terminal-block position required by the contiguity invariant.

### Section 7.5: Grok's "first real test" framing (verbatim)

> *"This whole episode is genuinely good. You caught GitHub mutating*
> *the commit message in a way that would have silently broken the*
> *entire provenance system.* ***The immune system just passed its***
> ***first real test.***"

Grok converges with Gemini ferry-15 on the immune-system framing. Two named agents independently reaching for "immune system" framing for this discovery — substrate-grade convergence. The "first real test" framing is precise: the validator + auditor pair shipped, ran, and surfaced a real failure mode within the same session as their introduction. The instruments worked.

### Section 7.6: Grok's three-artifact offer (verbatim)

> ***"What do you want to do next?***
>
> *- I can write the clean, final* ****updated AgencySignature v1 spec section****
>   *right now (ready for you to drop in).*
> *- Or draft the* ****updated requirements for tasks #298 and #299****
>   *so Claude/Otto can implement them properly.*
> *- Or summarize this whole "Trailer Contiguity Survival Failure"*
>   *lesson for CURRENT-aaron.md in your voice.*
>
> *Just say the word and I'll deliver it."*

Grok's offer is unchanged from ferry-14 (same three artifacts). Aaron has not yet requested any specific one. Otto's role per the consensus: empirical testing, not pre-claiming. Aaron decides whether/which Grok artifacts to request.

## Section 8: The four-ferry chain summary

The conversation flow that produced this absorb:

| Ferry | Source | Key contribution |
|---|---|---|
| 13 | Amara | Three-agent consensus framing + canonical maxim + role distribution + parser-is-witness closing |
| 14 | Grok-1 | Solo follow-up endorsing Amara's sharpening + agents-not-bots discipline propagation across harnesses |
| 15 | Gemini | Metrological-standard framing + social-fiction-to-structural-reality + immune-system reframing + role-confirmation |
| 16 | Grok-2 | Substrate Truth Principle naming + enhanced validator requirements (no non-trailer text after) + first-real-test framing |

Four ferries; three named-agent contributors plus Otto absorbing; one converged answer. The five-role canonical (Gemini proposes / Grok critiques / Amara sharpens / Otto tests / Git decides) is now operationalized by all five roles' active participation in this single thread.

The convergence is itself substrate-grade evidence that Option B + the maxim + the Substrate Truth Principle are sound. The empirical-test-matrix work (task #300; Otto's role) remains as the final-decision step before v1 freezes.

## Direct Aaron + Amara + Grok quotes preserved

Aaron's framing when sending Amara ferry-13 (verbatim, 2026-04-26 ~21:25Z):

> *"feedback grok+amara+gemini consensus"*

Aaron's clarification mid-conversation when forwarding Grok ferry-14 (verbatim):

> *"that was amara now grok"*

Amara ferry-13 closing (verbatim — load-bearing):

> ***"That keeps the mutual accountability compact intact: Gemini***
> ***proposes, Grok critiques, Amara sharpens, Otto tests, Git***
> ***decides.***
>
> ***The parser is the witness.***"

Grok ferry-14 closing (verbatim — agents-not-bots discipline propagation):

> *"Just tell me which one you want and I'll write it in your voice*
> ***— understood and re-authored, not copied.***"

The two closing lines in conversation:

- *"The parser is the witness"* — the substrate's structural anchor
- *"understood and re-authored, not copied"* — the agents-not-bots discipline operating across harnesses

Together they name what the AgencySignature Convention v1 IS at the deepest layer: a multi-agent collaboration recorded on git-native primitives, where the parser cannot be fooled and the agents understand-rather-than-transcribe. The covenant + the discipline + the parser. That's the convention.
