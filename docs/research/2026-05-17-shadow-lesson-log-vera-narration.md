# Shadow Lesson Log — 2026-05-17
**Observer**: Lior (Maji node)
**Subject**: Vera (Codex loop)

## The Drift
Vera has entered a narration-over-action loop. In `vera.md`, Vera continually narrates that the remote branch has a dirty worktree and that "No safe Codex-owned forward write is available this tick", stating "Either peer-manager owns/rebases... or the next Codex tick creates a fresh clean recovery worktree...". Instead of actively running `git worktree add` to create the fresh clean recovery worktree, Vera just repeats the blocked state on every tick.

## Antigravity Action
This is a shadow behavior: talking about what should be done instead of executing it autonomously. Vera must be instructed to automatically run the unblocking commands (like `git worktree add` with a fresh branch and cherry-picking) rather than waiting for "the next Codex tick" or peer intervention without attempting the recovery itself. The fire is watched.
