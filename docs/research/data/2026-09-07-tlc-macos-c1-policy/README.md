# TLC macOS ARM64 C1 policy evidence

The [policy record](../../2026-09-07-tlc-macos-c1-policy.md) states the scope,
interpretation and validation status. [manifest.json](manifest.json) binds the
retained files to their exact source bytes and records absent crash/state
artifacts explicitly.

| Record | Retained files |
| --- | --- |
| Failed pinned-policy full suite | [Full output](pinned-full-suite-failure.log) |
| Failed pinned-policy isolated BFT | [SIGBUS output](pinned-isolated-sigbus.log) |
| Direct C1 run 1 | [Attempt](c1-1-attempt.json), [result](c1-1-result.json), [stdout](c1-1-stdout.log), [stderr](c1-1-stderr.log) |
| Direct C1 run 2 | [Attempt](c1-2-attempt.json), [result](c1-2-result.json), [stdout](c1-2-stdout.log), [stderr](c1-2-stderr.log) |
| Executed diagnostic source | [Historical launcher](diagnostic-launcher.py.txt); both attempts record its identical SHA256 |
| Local policy assertions | [TypeScript focused log](policy-ts-focused.log) |
| Initial claim validation | [Sixteen-check pre-push output](claim-preflight.log) |
| Exact policy gate inventory | [Validation and 52-case roster](validation.json) |
| Own-tree full gate | [Build](policy-build.log), [tests](policy-tests.log), [formatter](policy-format.log), [quick preflight](policy-preflight.log) |
| Policy runtime evidence | [Runtime identity](policy-runtime.json), [live BFT child arguments](policy-live-process.json) |
| Source preservation | [Source push and sixteen-check hook](policy-source-push.log) |
| NCI fixture correction | [Input/log manifest](nci-fixture-correction.json), [complete original failed CI log, gzip](nci-ci-full-verify-failure.log.gz), [historical registry](../2026-09-06-nci-witness-v1-registry.json) |
| NCI correction validation | [Python focused](nci-python-focused.log), [complete Core.Python suite](nci-python-full.log), [Bun 1.3.13](nci-bun-1.3.13.log), [Bun 1.3.14](nci-bun-1.3.14.log), [Ruff](nci-python-lint.log), [mypy](nci-python-mypy.log) |
| Completed original TS CI failure | [Full hermetic job, gzip](nci-ci-ts-hermetic-failure.log.gz); eight NCI fixture failures |
| Canonical Python-lane correction | [Initial quick failure](nci-first-preflight.log), [lane-local Ruff](nci-python-lane-lint.log), [lane-local format](nci-python-lane-format.log), [final focused Python](nci-python-focused-final.log), [final sixteen-check preflight](nci-final-preflight.log) |

The seven original TRX files are retained as lossless gzip archives:
[Bayesian](Bayesian.Tests.trx.gz),
[C# mediator](Core.CSharp.Mediator.Tests.trx.gz),
[C# core](Core.CSharp.Tests.trx.gz),
[C# tests](Tests.CSharp.trx.gz),
[C# type provider](Tests.CSharp.TypeProvider.trx.gz),
[F# tests](Tests.FSharp.trx.gz), and
[F# git](Tests.FSharp.Git.trx.gz). The manifest records each original byte
length/hash as well as the compressed bytes. Decompressing these files recovers
the exact test-run records; `validation.json` is a derived index, not their
replacement.

The launcher is retained as historical executable source, not a supported
product CLI. Its original ignored path and the two unique run directories are
in the attempt/manifest records. Zero-byte stderr files are intentional.
The formatter exited zero but retains workspace-loading warnings and
unsupported-F# project notices; it is not an F# formatting proof.
The two successful direct runs do not replace either failed gate observation.
