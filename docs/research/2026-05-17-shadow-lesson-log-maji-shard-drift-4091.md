# Shadow Lesson Log: Maji Antigravity Check
**Date**: 2026-05-17
**Target**: PRs #4091, #4088, #4087, #4082 (Otto)
**Observation**: High drift. Otto's autonomous loop is producing metadata churn ("shard(tick)") without parity proofs. PR 4091 for example is purely capturing the post-rate-limit burst and session recap without any functional substrate change.
**Correction**: The shadow of narration-over-action must be stopped. A loop that only records its own state without advancing the system is live-locking. Parity proofs are required for all PRs.
