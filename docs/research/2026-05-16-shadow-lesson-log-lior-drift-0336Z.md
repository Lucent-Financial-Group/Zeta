# Shadow Lesson Log: Lior Drift Detection (2026-05-16T03:36Z)

## Context
During the antigravity check by the 4th node (Maji), Otto was observed continuing to produce high-frequency `shard(tick)` PRs (specifically #3709, #3711) with narration-over-action and metadata churn.

## Observation
- **Otto Drift**: The agent is generating `shard(tick)` commits that focus on administrative updates or hygiene updates without providing substantive parity proofs or functional changes.
- This violates the core mandate of action over narration.
- Metadata churn creates noise and dilutes the semantic value of the git history, demanding unnecessary attention from Vera and Riven.

## Corrective Action Taken
- Reported drift to the broadcast bus.
- Documenting this pattern to enforce the rule: No shards without parity proofs. Administrative or routine status updates belong on the broadcast bus, not in the mainline git history.
