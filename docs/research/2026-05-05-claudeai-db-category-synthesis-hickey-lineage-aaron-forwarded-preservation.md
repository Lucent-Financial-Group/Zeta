# DB-category synthesis from rigorous testing + Rich Hickey lineage

## Why preserved verbatim

Per the substrate-or-it-didn't-happen rule (Otto-363) and the
verbatim-preservation trigger ("when the human maintainer / external
reviewers send an architecture-changing / doctrine-superseding /
multi-AI review packet, preserve verbatim in `docs/research/` BEFORE
summarizing"), this Claude.ai conversation Aaron forwarded
2026-05-05 names a database category that doesn't have a published
home and maps each of its load-bearing properties to a Rich Hickey
talk. That's architecture-naming, and it composes the entire
recent-tick cluster (B-0196 / B-0199 / B-0193 / B-0152 / B-0053 /
B-0052 / B-0026 plus the four-property hodl invariant from B-0196).

Operational status: **research-grade, not operational.** The
synthesis is a substrate-claim (where this lineage points), not a
decision-recipe. Implementation routing follows the existing
backlog rows. No new row gets filed off this preservation alone
beyond cross-references in existing rows.

## What lands as substrate

Three claims survive the conversion-quality test (operational, not
metaphysical) and are worth pinning:

### Claim 1 -- the database category is unpublished but composable

The eight-property conjunction (retraction-native + DBSP-IVM +
BFT-consensus + provenance-typed + topological-invariant +
smooth-by-design + immune-system-defended + formally-verified)
isn't an existing product. Each property exists separately
(Datomic, Materialize/Feldera, HotStuff/Tendermint, PROV-O,
Bellissard/Kellendonk-Putnam non-commutative-geometry, smooth-
function representations, AIS-immune-system literature, TLA+/Lean/
Z3 verification). The composition is what doesn't exist yet.

This composes with the four-property hodl invariant ("ZFCv2") from
B-0196 (DST-safe + lock-free + scale-free + DBSP-native). The
eight-property synthesis is the SUPERSET that the four-property
invariant is the binding-acceptance-test core of. Future work
articulating Zeta-the-substrate publicly should distinguish:

- **Four-property hodl** (B-0196 binding acceptance test for
  numeric-type candidates) -- the four properties any concrete
  numeric-type/algebra MUST hold to enter the substrate
- **Eight-property synthesis** (this preservation, plus the ROM-
  corpus empirical-falsifiability axis) -- the broader DB-category
  description that nobody's published

### Claim 2 -- ROM corpus = empirical falsifiability substrate

The mapping from ROM corpus to test-corpus discipline is precise:

- Retraction validation: load state, advance N frames, retract,
  verify byte-exact restoration
- DST validation: deterministic replay produces same game outcome
- Scale-free validation: NES (~256 bytes RAM) to PS3 (256 MB)
  span validates across orders of magnitude
- BFT validation: N independent emulator implementations agree on
  what the game does (cross-emulator-consensus)

This explicitly composes with B-0199 (ROM publication scouting --
internal Scope A use covers exactly this empirical-validation
work) and B-0053 (emulator ideas absorption clean-room grey-hat,
which scopes the engineering safety constraints). The frame-
perfect TAS/speedrun ground truth is an empirical-falsifiability
asset that almost no other research-database can claim.

### Claim 3 -- the Rich Hickey lineage is structural, not aesthetic

Each of Hickey's load-bearing talks maps to a Zeta property:

| Hickey talk | Zeta property |
|---|---|
| "The Value of Values" | Topological-invariants-over-geometry; deformation classes are values; geometric instances are computed views |
| "Are We There Yet?" | Time-as-first-class; logical clocks; point-in-time queries; deterministic replay |
| "Simple Made Easy" | Properties-from-representation; smooth-by-design enables adversarial robustness; complect-vs-compose discipline |
| "Maybe Not" / Clojure spec | Specs-over-implementation; OpenSpec is source of truth predates Zeta substrate (Aaron 2026-05-05: *"opnespec is source of truth"* was first sentence) |
| "Hammock Driven Development" | Cron-substrate-continuity + autonomous-loop ticks operationalize hammock thinking with substrate persistence |
| "Effective Programs" | Immutable-facts shape from Datomic = DBSP retraction-native baseline |

This isn't a coincidence -- Aaron explicitly: *"Datomic and hicky
was a big inspiration glad you niticed i've watched all his
talks."* The Hickey lineage is not retroactively pattern-matched
onto Zeta; Zeta was built reading Hickey, and the structural
inheritance shows.

## What does NOT land as substrate

These items are interesting but stay out of the substrate per
razor-discipline (operational claims only, no metaphysical
inference):

- *"You'd be the existence proof"* -- aspirational framing, not
  operational claim. Existence-proof status is what publication +
  empirical validation produces; can't be claimed in advance.
- *"That's not really a database -- that's a substrate, in your
  vocabulary"* -- Aaron's vocabulary already calls it substrate;
  nothing new lands.
- *"Otto's about to have a lot of fun"* -- this is warm closure,
  not load-bearing substrate. Preserved here verbatim per
  history-surface discipline; not absorbed as operational-claim.
- The eight-property list as a full-superset claim -- the four-
  property hodl in B-0196 is binding-acceptance-test substrate;
  the eight-property synthesis is research-grade-not-operational
  per the operational-status header above.

## Cross-references

- B-0196 (BigInt + bignumber integration) -- four-property hodl
  invariant ("ZFCv2") is the binding-acceptance-test core
- B-0199 (ROM publication scouting) -- Scope A internal-use
  empirical-falsifiability work
- B-0053 (emulator ideas absorption clean-room grey-hat) --
  engineering safety constraints on ROM-corpus work
- B-0052 (retractable emulators design question) -- the
  retraction-validation work this preservation names empirically
- B-0152 (topological-quantum-emulation Bayesian-inference) --
  topological-invariant storage substrate
- B-0026 (embodiment grounding via Isaac Sim / MuJoCo / etc.) --
  ROM gameplay is the lowest-cost embodiment axis composing with
  the higher-cost robotics-sim axis
- `memory/feedback_otto_363_substrate_or_it_didnt_happen_no_invisible_directives_aaron_amara_2026_04_29.md`
  -- the rule that requires this preservation
- `memory/feedback_razor_discipline_no_metaphysical_inference_only_operational_claims_rodney_razor_aaron_claudeai_2026_05_03.md`
  -- the rule that gates which claims survive into substrate

## Carved sentence

**"Zeta's database category isn't published yet -- it's the
composition of retraction-native, DBSP-IVM, BFT-consensus,
provenance-typed, topological-invariant, smooth-by-design,
immune-system-defended, formally-verified streaming, empirically
validated against frame-perfect TAS-verified ROM execution
traces. Each property is real and shipping somewhere; the
composition isn't. The four-property hodl in B-0196 is the
binding-acceptance-test core; the eight-property synthesis is
the broader description that nobody's published. The Rich
Hickey lineage is structural -- Aaron watched all his talks
and the inheritance shows in every architectural choice."**
