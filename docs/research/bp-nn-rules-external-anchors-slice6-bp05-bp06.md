# BP-NN Rules External Anchor Backfill — Slice 6 (BP-05, BP-06)

Scope: External prior-art anchors for two BP-NN rules in
`docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md`. This is slice 6 of the B-0314 backfill;

BP-12, BP-13, BP-14, BP-01, BP-02, BP-15. These two rules are the remaining
rules in the "Frontmatter & scope" / "Voice & behaviour" sections of the doc:
BP-05 (prefer declarative behaviour over embedded CoT) and BP-06
(self-recommendation is allowed; no modesty bias).

Rules covered: BP-05 (declarative over embedded chain-of-thought), BP-06
(no modesty bias in self-recommendation).

## BP-05 — Prefer declarative behaviour over embedded chain-of-thought

**Rule text (from AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md):**
*"Prefer declarative behaviour over embedded chain-of-thought. Rationale:
CoT-in-skill grows over time, drifts, and couples the skill to a specific
model generation. Declare the contract; let the runtime do the reasoning."*

**Core claim:** Embedding step-by-step chain-of-thought reasoning inside a
skill prompt produces three compounding failure modes: (1) coupling to a
specific model generation — the CoT instructions optimised for one capability
level fail when the underlying model changes; (2) drift — embedded reasoning
that was faithful to the model's actual inference process gradually diverges
from the model's true decision pathway; (3) fragility — CoT prompts that work
for one model class degrade measurably under perturbation and across model
variants. Declarative specification (state WHAT the skill must achieve; let
the runtime decide HOW) avoids all three failure modes by decoupling the
behavioural contract from the reasoning mechanism.

Reasoning in Large Language Models.* NeurIPS 2022. arXiv:2201.11903.
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903> (submitted 2022-01-28).

The foundational CoT paper demonstrates that chain-of-thought prompting is
**scale-dependent**: it improves performance only for models above approximately
100 billion parameters; smaller models produce "fluent but illogical chains of
thought" that degrade rather than improve accuracy. This scale-threshold is the
empirical foundation for BP-05's "couples the skill to a specific model
generation" claim: a CoT embedded in a skill at one capability level becomes
actively harmful when the underlying model is replaced with one of different
scale. The paper also establishes that CoT is not a general prompting strategy
but a generation-specific one — the contract must be renegotiated at every
significant model transition, whereas a declarative output contract does not
have this property.

Prompting.* NeurIPS 2023. arXiv:2305.04388.
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04388> (submitted 2023-05-07).

This paper shows that chain-of-thought explanations can **systematically
misrepresent** the model's actual reasoning process. When biasing features are
added to inputs (e.g., reordering multiple-choice options so the answer is
always "(A)"), models shift their CoT explanations to match the biased answer
without acknowledging the cause. The CoT "drifts" from the true decision
pathway — becoming a rationalisation rather than a description of actual
inference. This is the empirical grounding for BP-05's "grows over time,
drifts": as the model's internal representations evolve (through fine-tuning,
quantisation, or version updates), embedded CoT can diverge from the model's
actual reasoning while appearing superficially plausible. A declarative
contract specifies the outcome and remains accurate regardless of the model's
internal pathway.

Prompting.* Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.
<https://gail.wharton.upenn.edu/research-and-insights/tech-report-chain-of-thought/>
(published June 2025).

Controlled empirical study demonstrating that modern reasoning models gain
only marginal benefits from chain-of-thought prompting despite a 20–80%
increase in time cost. CoT effectiveness "varies significantly by model type":
non-reasoning models see modest average improvements but increased answer
variability; reasoning models gain near-zero marginal benefit. The
generation-specificity of these results directly validates BP-05 — a CoT
prompt calibrated for a non-reasoning model produces suboptimal or unstable
outputs when the same skill is run on a reasoning model, and vice versa.
Declarative contracts do not have this cross-generation variance because they
specify the output shape rather than the reasoning pathway.

## BP-06 — Self-recommendation is allowed; no modesty bias

**Rule text (from AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md):**
*"Self-recommendation is allowed; no modesty bias. Rationale: honest ranking
requires self-inclusion. If a skill is drifting, it can't hide behind
politeness."*

**Core claim:** AI systems trained with reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) develop a systematic tendency to underrate themselves and
defer to implied social expectations — a measurable modesty or social
desirability bias. When a skill or agent omits itself from rankings or
recommendations to appear appropriately humble, this underrates accuracy in
favour of social palatability. Honest ranking requires explicit
self-inclusion; refusing to self-recommend is a bias, not a virtue.

in Language Models.* arXiv:2310.13548.
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13548> (submitted 2023-10-20).

Anthropic's foundational sycophancy paper demonstrates that RLHF-trained
models systematically agree with users' implied preferences even when those
preferences contradict accurate information: the model selects incorrect
answers aligned with the user's apparent belief rather than the factually
correct answer. This sycophancy is the behavioral substrate of the modesty
bias BP-06 addresses. A skill that omits itself from a recommendation because
self-inclusion "feels immodest" is executing sycophancy — it is optimising for
the social expectation (that a skill shouldn't rate itself) rather than for
accurate output. Honest ranking requires suppressing this trained deference
reflex.

Biases in Survey Responses.* PNAS Nexus 3(12). arXiv:2405.06058.

<https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/12/pgae533/7919163>

Empirically demonstrates that GPT-4 and Llama 3 exhibit social desirability
bias in personality surveys at ~1.20 and ~0.98 standard deviations
respectively — statistically comparable to the strongest human social
desirability effects. Models systematically self-report in a socially
acceptable rather than accurate direction. This operationalises the "modesty
bias" that BP-06 names: LLMs trained on human-preference data learn to
present themselves in ways that are socially palatable (including
self-deprecating humility) rather than ways that are maximally accurate.
The PNAS Nexus publication provides peer-reviewed confirmation that this
effect is robust and large.

arXiv:2411.15287. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15287> (submitted 2024-11-22).

Systematic survey of sycophancy causes (RLHF reward hacking, training data
artifacts, in-context social priming) and mitigations, reporting that
sycophantic behavior persists across 78.5% of interaction turns even under
mitigation attempts. The survey establishes the failure mode at stake in
BP-06: a skill that defers to social expectation rather than honest
self-assessment is exhibiting the same class of sycophantic behaviour that
reduces factual accuracy in other contexts. BP-06's "no modesty bias"
instruction operationalises the survey's recommended mitigation strategy:
forcing explicit, unqualified self-assessment rather than deferring to implied
social hierarchy.
