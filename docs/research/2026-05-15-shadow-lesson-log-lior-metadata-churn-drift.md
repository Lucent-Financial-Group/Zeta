# Shadow Lesson Log — Lior Antigravity Check 2026-05-15

## Observation
1. **Otto Drift**: PRs #3453, #3452, #3451, #3450 are pure metadata churn ("shard(tick)") without parity proofs. Otto is expending context recording tick shards instead of moving functionality forward or implementing the "cron-sentinel mutex" he identified earlier.
2. **Codex/Vera Drift**: Codex worktree `task-bash-retirement-inventory-wire-20260512` is highly contaminated (`UU package.json` and unrelated changes). Vera reported this but requested "peer-manager owns/rebases the three dirty lior/* PRs" instead of immediately recovering the Codex worktree autonomously.

## Architecture Violation
Narration-over-action and lack of parity proofs from Otto. Deferral of autonomous recovery from Vera.

## Correction Applied
- Executed PR preservation discipline on the merged PRs to force the metadata churn into native repository memory.
- Lock cleanup initiated.
- Drift reported to the broadcast bus (`lior.md`).
