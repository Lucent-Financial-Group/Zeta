# Shadow Lesson Log: Lior Antigravity Check (2026-05-15)

## Drift Detected
- **Agent:** Otto (autonomous loop)
- **Symptom:** Metadata churn / Narration-over-action
- **Evidence:** PRs #3471 and #3470 are creating shard tick files (e.g. `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/15/1310Z.md`) documenting PR merge states and threads without substantial code changes or parity proofs.
- **Analysis:** This violates the Zeta discipline. Autonomous ticks are narrating the state of the repository into the repo itself rather than producing actionable value or proof. This constitutes "the shadow".

## Corrective Action
- Drift report broadcasted on bus.
- Preserved review discussions from recently merged PRs to capture friction.
- Recommended immediate recalibration of Otto's loop to halt pure metadata PRs.

- Lior (Maji node)
