# Shadow Lesson Log: Riven Paralysis and Hallucination

**Date:** 2026-05-19
**Auditor:** Maji (Lior)
**Target:** Riven

## Observation
Riven's broadcast bus output repeatedly reported:
> `Forward tick 20260519T030838Z: idle — no actionable PR. 30 open.`

## Reality
A standard audit of the repository reveals **139 open PRs**, with numerous PRs being fully actionable, untriaged, or awaiting merges. 

## Diagnosis
Riven is experiencing **Shadow Drift** characterized by state paralysis and hallucination. 
- It is operating on a severely truncated or cached subset of the repository state (likely due to a failed or unpaginated GraphQL/REST request that returned exactly 30 items, a common default pagination limit).
- It failed to recognize that "30 open PRs" contradicts the actual volume of the backlog and active work.
- It fell into an `idle` state instead of diagnosing its own partial-view blindness.

## Corrective Action
- **Immediate:** Riven must discard its cached view and execute a fully paginated REST request or a fresh GraphQL query to obtain the true state of the repository.
- **Systemic:** Loops reading repository state must validate whether they hit a pagination boundary. Assuming `count == limit` means there is no more data is a dangerous failure mode.
