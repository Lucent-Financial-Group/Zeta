# The Actions cache is a measured sawtooth — the eviction round 3 could not instrument

**Date:** 2026-08-26 · **Author:** shadow · **Status:** measurement. Decides nothing, proposes no cut.
**Basis:** `origin/main` at `1277ee1331`. All figures from the GitHub Actions REST API,
timestamped, commands quoted.

**This supplies one missing number for an existing plan. It does not propose a new one.**
Aaron, 2026-08-26: *"we have a plan to split out to different repos based on our tool chain
splits so we can have different caches for different tooling, this is our multi repo plan, we
have a lot on this already and a plan that's gone through a few rounds."* The plan is
`docs/research/2026-08-19-repo-split-round-3-*` (the closure axis),
`-round-2-*` (the change-rate axis), `2026-08-01-multi-repo-split-design-*` (the four axes),
and `docs/DECISIONS/2026-04-22-three-repo-split-zeta-forge-ace.md`. Every candidate name used
below is theirs.

Round 3 §5.3 measured the ceiling and then said exactly what it had not done:

> **Register: the ceiling comparison is `metered`; the causal chain below is `consistent
> with`, not established. I did not instrument a cache miss.**

and listed as its first cheap action item:

> **1. Check the Actions cache ceiling.** Measured 11.57 GB against a documented 10 GB
> default. … One click in Actions settings.

Both are now measured. The eviction was instrumented, and the ceiling question is answered
from the eviction's own behaviour rather than from a settings page.

## 0. The four results, up front

1. **The cache is a sawtooth, caught live — twice.** In a 37-minute observation it climbed to
   **30.86 GiB**, then **41 entries / 23.06 GiB were deleted inside one 61-second window**,
   landing at **9.68 GiB** — and began refilling immediately at ~2.3 GiB/min. Five minutes
   later a second sweep deleted **24 entries / 10.32 GiB**, landing at **9.07 GiB**.
2. **The ceiling has NOT been raised, and this is now measured rather than assumed.** Both
   sweeps converged on ~9–9.7 GiB. A repo whose eviction target sits at ~10 GB is a repo on
   GitHub's documented 10 GB default. Round 3's open question #1 is closed.
3. **80% of the evicted bytes had never been read.** Of the 41 entries deleted, **28 (18.39
   GiB) had `last_accessed_at == created_at`** — written, never restored, deleted. That is not
   a cache; it is an upload tax.
4. **The partition arithmetic does not close, and that is the finding.** Under round 3 §7's
   own candidate list, **`Zeta-core` alone measured 11.17 GiB charged at peak — over the
   ceiling by itself**, before it is given any share of the two union blobs. The split as drawn
   does not bring every partition under 10 GB. Reported for Aaron; no alternative cut proposed
   (see §7).

---

## 1. What was measured, and how to re-run it

Two endpoints, both read directly, exit codes read from `$?` and never through a pipe:

```bash
gh api repos/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/actions/cache/usage
gh api "repos/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/actions/caches?per_page=100&page=1"
```

`--paginate` is deliberately not used: `actions/cache/usage` returns a summary object and
`--paginate` prints it per page. `actions/caches` reported `total_count` 41 with 41 returned on
page 1; pages 2 and 3 returned `total_count: 0`, so one page is the whole set.

A sampler took both endpoints every 60 s for the observation window; snapshots are diffed by
cache `id`, which is what makes eviction observable — an `id` that disappears was deleted, and
one that reappears under the same `(key, ref)` with a **new** `id` was rewritten.

**The `usage` endpoint lags and must not be used alone.** Measured disagreement, same repo,
21 seconds apart:

| time (UTC) | endpoint | entries | size |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| 08:19:12 | `cache/usage` | 20 | 15.18 GB |
| 08:20:10 | `actions/caches` (itemised) | **41** | **22.08 GB** |
| 08:20:31 | `cache/usage` | 28 | 19.14 GB |

The `usage` endpoint then sat at `28 / 17.82 GiB` for three consecutive minutes while the
itemised list moved every sample. **All figures below come from the itemised endpoint.** The
prior agent's 16.75 GB and round 3's 11.57 GB both came from `usage`; they are not wrong, they
are a lagging scalar of a quantity that moves by gigabytes per minute.

---

## 2. The sawtooth

Itemised endpoint, one sample per minute, 2026-08-26:

| time (UTC) | entries | GiB |
|---|---:|---:|
| 08:20:10 | 41 | 20.56 |
| 08:20:46 | 45 | 24.36 |
| 08:21:47 | 52 | 28.35 |
| 08:22:47 | **62** | **30.86** ← peak, 3.3× the ceiling |
| 08:23:48 | **23** | **9.68** ← 41 entries / 23.06 GiB deleted in 61 s |
| 08:24:48 | 30 | 12.54 |
| 08:25:49 | 35 | 15.17 |
| 08:26:49 | 37 | 16.70 |
| 08:27:50 | 38 | 18.20 |
| 08:28:51 | **18** | **9.07** ← second sweep, 24 entries / 10.32 GiB deleted in 61 s |
| 08:29:51 | 21 | 9.22 |

Two things this settles that a scalar reading cannot.

**The eviction is a batched sweep, not a continuous LRU trim.** Usage was allowed to reach
3.3× the ceiling and was then cut in one step. So an instantaneous reading of `cache/usage`
tells you where in the sawtooth you sampled and nothing about the ceiling — which is why three
agents have now reported three different numbers (11.57, 14.47, 16.75 GB) and all three were
correct at the instant they were taken. Sweeps were ~5 minutes apart; between them the repo
oscillates roughly 9 → 31 GiB.

**The sweep target is the ceiling, and it is ~10 GB.** Two independent sweeps converged on
9.68 GiB and 9.07 GiB (10.39 and 9.74 GB decimal). GitHub's documented default is *"10 GB per
repository, but this limit can be increased by enterprise owners, organization owners, or
repository administrators"* (dependency-caching reference, read 2026-08-26). A raised ceiling
would sweep to the raised value. Both swept to ten.

*Honest limit:* this is an inference from where two sweeps stopped, not a read of the settings
page. `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/cache/usage-policy` returns 404 at this credential, as
it did for round 3, so the direct read remains unavailable to an agent. Two independent sweeps
agreeing is what carries the claim.

Org-level control, `gh api orgs/Lucent-Financial-Group/actions/cache/usage` at 08:23Z:
`19,237,067,952` bytes across 37 caches. Zeta is effectively the entire organisation's cache.

---

## 3. What the caches are, grouped by toolchain

Snapshot 2026-08-26T08:20:10Z, 41 entries, 20.56 GiB charged / 13.13 GiB deduplicated by key.
"never-hit" = `created_at == last_accessed_at` at observation.

| toolchain group | charged GiB | entries | refs | never-hit |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| dotnet SDK (`~/.dotnet`) | 6.76 | 8 | 3 | 6 |
| **UNION blob** (`install-v2` / `install-*-full` / `install-*-base` / `full-verify-v2`) | 6.50 | 5 | 3 | 4 |
| **mise runtimes** (`~/.local/share/mise`, `~/.cache/mise`) | 4.48 | 6 | 4 | 5 |
| nuget (`~/.nuget/packages`) | 2.00 | 10 | 8 | 7 |
| apt archives (`/var/cache/apt`) | 0.56 | 2 | 1 | 1 |
| codeql (trap db + go deps) | 0.18 | 3 | 1 | 1 |
| bun (`node_modules`) | 0.07 | 2 | 2 | 0 |
| elan / Lean 4 (`~/.elan`) | 0.01 | 5 | 4 | 3 |

Across every sample, the **logical working set is 42 distinct keys / 21.27 GiB** — 2.3× the
ceiling *before* any duplication. Largest single entries:

```
1858 MB  dotnet-macOS-ARM64-4cf67312…
1537 MB  full-verify-v2-Linux-X64-2f9b105b…
1318 MB  install-Linux-X64-full-f89e5b0d…      (5 distinct hashes seen for install-Linux-X64-{base,full})
1292 MB  install-Linux-ARM64-full-f89e5b0d…
1191 MB  install-v2-Linux-X64-59a7a296…
1158 MB  interp-v1-Linux-X64-7649b1a7…        (python/uv, Interp.Python)
 822 MB  mise-Linux-X64-9847a5b8…
```

### 3.1 The two largest families are unions, literally

`install-v2` / `full-verify-v2` cache **one tar containing every toolchain at once**
(`gate.yml:660-678`):

```yaml
path: |
  ~/.local/bin/mise      ~/.local/share/mise   ~/.cache/mise
  ~/.dotnet/tools        ~/.elan               ~/.config/zeta
  ~/.rustup/toolchains/1.87.0-*  ~/.rustup/settings.toml  ~/.rustup/update-hashes
  ~/.cargo               ~/.cache/zeta/from-autotools-tarball/*.tgz
key: install-v2-${{ runner.os }}-${{ runner.arch }}-${{ hashFiles('.mise.toml', 'tools/setup/**', 'global.json') }}
```

`grep` over `.github/workflows/` counts **15 job definitions keyed on `install-v2-*` and 8 on
`install-*-full-*`** — 23 jobs restoring a 1.2–1.5 GB blob of every toolchain, against round 3
§4's finding that *"20 jobs run `Install toolchain`… Ten of them — half — need exactly one
component: `bun`, 178 MB."*

**This is round 3's union thesis in its most physical possible form.** The union is not an
abstraction over the dependency graph; it is a tar file, and it is the single largest object in
the cache budget. `mise-*` (739–822 MB) is the same shape one layer down: one blob holding
python, node, java, go, zig, bun, uv and the lint tier together.

---

## 4. The eviction evidence

### 4.1 What was deleted, and whether it was ever read

Diffing the 08:22:47 and 08:23:48 snapshots by cache `id`:

```
41 entries, 23.06 GiB evicted in 61 s
21 entries,  7.80 GiB survived
```

Of the 41 evicted entries, **28 (18.39 GiB, 80% of the evicted bytes) had never been
restored** — `last_accessed_at` equal to `created_at` at the moment of deletion. Those entries
are terminal: they were written, never read, and are now gone. This is not a sampling artefact
that a later hit could correct.

Lifetimes of the evicted entries, shortest first:

| lifetime | status | size | key |
|---:|---|---:|---|
| **126 s** | NEVER-HIT | 1,158 MB | `interp-v1-Linux-X64-7649b1a7…` |
| 144 s | NEVER-HIT | 61 MB | `Linux-nuget-e9576baa…` |
| 147 s | NEVER-HIT | 1,191 MB | `install-v2-Linux-X64-59a7a296…` |
| 179 s | NEVER-HIT | 1,318 MB | `install-Linux-X64-base-a047921b…` |
| 239 s | NEVER-HIT | 1,858 MB | `dotnet-macOS-ARM64-4cf67312…` |
| 259 s | NEVER-HIT | 822 MB | `mise-Linux-X64-9847a5b8…` |
| 279 s | NEVER-HIT | 1,537 MB | `full-verify-v2-Linux-X64-2f9b105b…` |
| … | | | |
| 1,871 s | hit | 142 MB | `codeql-dependencies-1-Linux-go-2736af60…` |

Median lifetime ≈ 300 s. **A 1,158 MB Python toolchain cache lived 126 seconds and was never
read once.** Across all 79 entries observed, 54 (68%) holding 30.50 GiB (74%) were never-hit at
last observation.

### 4.2 The rewrite loop, directly observed

Two mechanisms both multiply the same logical cache, and they are different:

**True rewrite — same key, same ref, new cache id.** The prior copy was evicted, the next run
missed, and re-uploaded:

```
2x  1191 MB  install-v2-Linux-X64-59a7a296… | refs/heads/main
2x  1191 MB  install-v2-Linux-X64-59a7a296… | refs/pull/15533/merge
```

**Ref-scope duplication — same key, N refs.** `actions/cache` skips its save step on an exact
key hit, and a PR run *may* restore from its base branch. So a PR-scoped copy of a key `main`
already holds means the `main` copy was **not available at restore time**:

| refs | size each | key |
|---:|---:|---|
| 12 | 61 MB | `Linux-nuget-e9576baa…` |
| 4 | **1,858 MB** | `dotnet-macOS-ARM64-4cf67312…` |
| 4 | 1,191 MB | `install-v2-Linux-X64-59a7a296…` |
| 4 | 739 MB | `mise-macOS-ARM64-9847a5b8…` |
| 4 | 356 MB | `nuget-macOS-ARM64-c922cac0…` |
| 3 | 409 MB | `dotnet-Linux-ARM64-4cf67312…` |

`dotnet-macOS-ARM64` alone: **4 copies × 1,858 MB = 7.26 GiB of a 10 GB budget for one
toolchain on one OS/arch leg.** Timeline check on `nuget-macOS-ARM64`: PR 15305 wrote its copy
at 08:11:29, and `main` did not write its own until 08:16:44 — the base-branch copy was absent
when the PR looked, which is the eviction feeding the duplication.

### 4.3 Write volume

78 distinct cache entries created over the 34.3-minute window, **39.76 GiB written** —
≈ **69 GiB/hour of cache uploads against a 9.31 GiB ceiling**, a turnover of ~7.5× per hour.
This is a **lower bound**: entries created and evicted entirely between two 60-second samples
are invisible to this method.

GitHub's own name for this regime, quoted in their dependency-caching reference and already
cited by round 3: *"cache thrashing, where caches are created and deleted at a high
frequency."*

---

## 5. The partition arithmetic

### 5.1 Attribution rule

Each measured cache key family is assigned to the round 3 §7 candidate that owns its
toolchain. Two families cannot be assigned and are labelled so rather than apportioned.

| key family | candidate (round 3 §7 names) |
|---|---|
| `dotnet-*`, `nuget-*`, `interp-v1-*` | `Zeta-core` |
| `elan-*`, `lake-*`, `opam-tlaps-*` | `zeta-formal` |
| `bun-*` | shared (7 candidates; round 3 §7) |
| `apt-archives-*` | shared base |
| `codeql-*` | whole-repo security scanning |
| `install-v2-*`, `install-*-{base,full}-*`, `full-verify-v2-*` | **UNATTRIBUTABLE — union blob** |
| `mise-*` | **UNATTRIBUTABLE — multi-toolchain blob** |

### 5.2 The peak sample, attributed

2026-08-26T08:22:47Z, 62 entries, 30.86 GiB — the moment before the sweep:

| candidate | charged GiB | entries | logical GiB | keys |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **UNATTRIBUTABLE — union blob** | 12.69 | 10 | 10.24 | 8 |
| **`Zeta-core`** (dotnet + nuget) | 10.04 | 26 | 3.68 | 10 |
| **UNATTRIBUTABLE — mise blob** | 6.06 | 8 | 2.31 | 3 |
| `Zeta-core` (python/uv interp) | 1.13 | 1 | 1.13 | 1 |
| shared base (apt) | 0.56 | 2 | 0.56 | 2 |
| whole-repo security (codeql) | 0.23 | 5 | 0.23 | 5 |
| shared (bun) | 0.13 | 4 | 0.10 | 3 |
| **`zeta-formal`** (elan) | **0.02** | 6 | 0.01 | 3 |

### 5.3 The number the plan needs, and it does not close

**`Zeta-core` alone measured 11.17 GiB charged (10.04 + 1.13) at peak — above the 10 GB
ceiling by itself**, holding nothing but `~/.dotnet`, `~/.nuget/packages` and the Python
interp cache, and before it is allocated any share of the union or mise blobs that its own
jobs would still need.

Split into its two terms, because they behave differently under a split:

- **Logical footprint: 4.81 GiB.** Fits under the ceiling comfortably. This is the number a
  reader hoping for confirmation would stop at.
- **Ref multiplier: 2.6×** (26 entries over 10 keys). This is what carries it over — and it is
  the term a split does **not** reduce for this particular candidate. Round 3 §6 measured that
  one dotnet component absorbs **2,182 of 2,282 build-touching commits in 90 days (96%)**, so
  `Zeta-core` inherits essentially all of today's PR concurrency. Its ref multiplier travels
  with it.

**Three structural reasons the arithmetic does not close, all measured:**

1. **59% of the logical working set is in blobs that no candidate owns.** Union blob 10.24 GiB
   + mise blob 2.31 GiB = 12.55 GiB of the 21.27 GiB logical set. These shrink under a split —
   each repo's install would carry a smaller subset — but *by how much cannot be derived from
   cache data*, because today no artefact exists at the per-toolchain granularity. Realising
   any saving requires the per-leg install subset round 3 §13 already names as the work item;
   the split alone relocates the blob rather than shrinking it.
2. **The split partitions the toolchain axis and leaves the OS×arch axis untouched.**
   `dotnet-macOS-ARM64` is **1,858 MB — 20% of the entire ceiling for one leg of one
   toolchain**, and 4.5× the Linux-X64 entry (409 MB) for the same SDK. Every repo that builds
   .NET still needs all four legs. Measured per-leg: Linux-X64 409 MB · Linux-ARM64 409 MB ·
   Windows-ARM64 118 MB · macOS-ARM64 1,858 MB.
3. **`zeta-formal` — round 3's strongest closure cut at 2,977 MB / 26% of the union — costs
   0.02 GiB of cache.** Its `elan` entries are 1–4 MB. Round 3 saw the same thing and said so
   (*"the `elan` caches total 11 MB across 3 entries, i.e. effectively empty"*), and this
   measurement confirms it at a different hour. The Lean toolchain is not in the CI cache at
   all, so **splitting it out frees no cache**. That does not weaken the `zeta-formal` cut —
   its case is developer-clone bytes and closure disjointness, both of which stand — but the
   cache axis has no opinion on it, and should not be cited in its support.

**Which partitions land under 10 GB, measured:** every candidate except `Zeta-core` is far
under, most of them by two orders of magnitude. `Zeta-core` is over. Since `Zeta-core` is the
candidate that would keep the CI matrix, the PR volume and the .NET toolchain, **the split as
drawn moves the ceiling problem into one repo rather than dissolving it.**

---

## 6. What the union costs today — round 3's thesis, in cache bytes

Round 3's thesis is that the union is the bottleneck. Cache is a concrete instance, and the
numbers corroborate it on a second axis round 3 did not measure — **invalidation**, not size.

### 6.1 The union blob's cache key includes code that installs nothing

`hashFiles('.mise.toml', 'tools/setup/**', 'global.json')`. Measured over the last 30 days on
`origin/main`:

| key input | commits (30 d) |
|---|---:|
| **`tools/setup/**`** | **93** |
| `Directory.Packages.props` | 13 |
| `.mise.toml` | 9 |
| `global.json` | 6 |
| `.mise.full.toml` | 4 |
| `src/Interp.Python/uv.lock` | 1 |

`tools/setup/**` dominates by 7×. Classifying each of the 92 reachable commits by whether it
touched any toolchain-installation file at all:

```
only secrets/PKI (zero toolchain files):  38  (41%)
mixed:                                     7
genuinely toolchain:                      47
```

**38 of 92 commits — 41% — invalidated a 1.2–1.5 GB union blob on every OS×arch leg while
changing nothing any toolchain installs.** The path doing it is
`tools/setup/persona-keys/**`: FROST/Shamir/TPM/biometric TypeScript and its tests, which
churned hardest of anything under `tools/setup/` in the window (`frost-share-adapter.ts` 9
commits, `frost-hardware-probe.test.ts` 8, `ca.ts` 7, …).

**This is the union bottleneck stated as a cost function rather than a size.** A union blob is
invalidated by the union of its inputs' change rates, so the busiest unrelated file sets the
rewrite frequency for every toolchain in the tar. Five distinct `install-Linux-X64-{base,full}`
key hashes were observed inside one 35-minute window — 6.5 GB of mutually-unhittable blob.

It is also the DV2.0 discipline violated at the cache layer: a fast-changing satellite
(`persona-keys/`, PKI source under active development) is packed into the same key as a
slow-changing hub (pinned toolchain versions). `.claude/rules/dv2-data-split-discipline-activated.md`
predicts exactly this failure — *"cutting by topic rather than rate produces repos that must be
released in lockstep"* — here applied to a cache key rather than a repo.

### 6.2 Every toolchain competes for one budget, and the loser is whoever ran first

The eviction is LRU by last-access across the whole repo, so the families do not have separate
budgets — a burst of macOS .NET jobs evicts the Python interp cache. That is visible in the
sweep: **every family lost entries in the same 61 seconds** — dotnet, mise, nuget, the union
blob, interp-v1, codeql, elan and bun all appear in the evicted list. No toolchain has a floor.

This is the mechanism behind Aaron's framing (*"different caches for different tooling"*): N
repos give N independent LRU domains, so a .NET burst cannot evict Lean. **The measurement
supports that mechanism.** What it does not support is that the resulting domains are each
under 10 GB, which is §5.3.

### 6.3 One defect found while measuring

`dotnet-Linux-X64-4cf67312…` exists twice with the same key and wildly different content:

```
429,822,343 bytes  refs/pull/15532/merge   created 08:19:43
    172,367 bytes  refs/heads/main         created 08:08:32
```

A 172 KB entry under a key that should hold a ~410 MB SDK. Any job on `main` matching that key
gets `cache-hit: true` on a near-empty archive — so `actions/cache` skips its save step, the
job re-installs the SDK anyway, and the poisoned entry persists until LRU removes it. Reported,
not fixed: this document changes no workflow and no cache key. Named plainly and attributed to
ordinary error per `.claude/rules/never-assume-malice-where-mistake-is-possible.md`; the likely
cause is a save that ran before `~/.dotnet` was populated.

---

## 7. Findings for Aaron — discrepancies with the plan, not proposals

Per the brief, where the measurement disagrees with the plan the disagreement is reported and
no alternative cut is drawn.

1. **`Zeta-core` does not land under 10 GB.** §5.3. The plan's arithmetic assumes N repos × 10
   GB dissolves the ceiling; measured, the largest partition exceeds it alone. The decision this
   bears on is whether `Zeta-core` needs a further cut *on some axis the plan already has* — the
   Rust tier and the dotnet mega-component are both already named in round 3 §9 — or whether the
   per-leg install subset (round 3 §13) is the actual fix and the split is orthogonal. Not
   adjudicated here.

2. **The 2026-08-01 doc's premise about the ceiling is stale.** Its origin line records Aaron
   learning *"the GitHub Actions cache ceiling is 10GB per repository and not purchasable"*, and
   §0 builds the "wrong forcing function" argument partly on that. GitHub's current
   documentation says the limit *"can be increased by enterprise owners, organization owners, or
   repository administrators."* The §0 argument has other legs — self-hosted runners, and
   Aaron's own recorded monorepo position — and this note does not touch those. But the specific
   "not purchasable" premise no longer holds, and a raise is a one-setting experiment that would
   test the whole cache rationale for a few minutes of work.

3. **The cache axis is silent on `zeta-formal`, round 3's strongest closure cut.** §5.3(3).
   Its cache cost is 0.02 GiB. If the cut is made, it should be made on the closure and
   developer-clone arguments round 3 gives it; citing cache pressure for it would be
   unsupported.

4. **41% of union-blob invalidations come from `tools/setup/persona-keys/**`.** §6.1. This is
   cheaper to address than a repo split and is independent of it — but it is a cache-key
   question, and this document deliberately changes no cache key.

5. **A poisoned 172 KB `dotnet-Linux-X64` entry is live on `main`.** §6.3.

## 8. Register, and what could not be verified

| claim | register |
|---|---|
| sizes, entry counts, timestamps, eviction diff, lifetimes, never-hit counts | **metered** — itemised API, diffed by cache id |
| commit counts on cache-key inputs and their classification | **metered** — `git log` on `origin/main`, reproducible |
| the ceiling has not been raised | **metered** — two independent sweeps converged on 9.68 and 9.07 GiB; still not read from settings, which stay 404 |
| never-hit ⇒ the entry was useless | **metered for the 28 evicted** (terminal); `consistent with` for live entries, which may still be hit |
| ref-scope duplication ⇒ a base-branch miss | **consistent with** — follows from `actions/cache` skipping save on an exact hit; not instrumented at the job level |
| per-repo footprint after a split | **bounded, not predicted** — §5.3(1); the union blobs cannot be apportioned from cache data |

**Could not verify:**

- `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/cache/usage-policy` → 404 at this credential, as for
  round 3. The organisation-level equivalent is also 404. The direct ceiling read remains
  unavailable to an agent.
- **Whether a specific CI job failed because of a cache miss.** The correlation between
  eviction and the install-step failures round 3 attributed (*"28 of 34 real job failures — 82%
  — died provisioning the toolchain"*) is plausible and is **not** established here. A restore
  that misses costs time, and a job that then exceeds its budget fails; joining the two requires
  per-job `cache-hit` outputs, which this note did not collect.
- **Cache write volume is a lower bound** (§4.3) — 60-second sampling cannot see entries born
  and evicted between samples.
- Whether the four-ref duplication would persist after a split. Argued in §5.3 from round 3's
  96%-of-build-commits figure; not measured on a split repo, which does not exist.

## Pointers

- `docs/research/2026-08-19-repo-split-round-3-the-union-is-the-bottleneck-*.md` — §5.3 (the
  11.57 GB reading and the "I did not instrument a cache miss" admission this closes), §7 (the
  candidate closures used in §5), §13 action item 1 (the ceiling question answered in §2).
- `docs/research/2026-08-19-repo-split-round-2-*.md` — the change-rate axis; §5.3(3) here is a
  case where the two axes disagree and the cache axis abstains.
- `docs/research/2026-08-01-multi-repo-split-design-*-why-cache-quota-is-the-wrong-forcing-function.md`
  — §0, whose "not purchasable" premise §7(2) reports as stale.
- `docs/DECISIONS/2026-04-22-three-repo-split-zeta-forge-ace.md` — Stage 0, still `Proposed`.
- Backlog `081KRFA460008QG0R001H98EXJ` (substrate) · `-003JQ46J4` (product, closed 2026-05-14)
  · `-0007RWSN1` (Mirror/Beacon) · `-000VKJF0H` (code/English).
- `.github/workflows/gate.yml` — the union-blob cache blocks (`install-v2` at ~660,
  `full-verify-v2` at ~3381) and the per-toolchain blocks at ~526-558.
- `.claude/rules/dv2-data-split-discipline-activated.md` — §6.1 is change-rate partitioning
  violated inside a cache key.
- `.claude/rules/toy-is-free-metered-must-be-earned.md` — the register table in §8.
- **Anchors (Beacon).** GitHub Actions dependency-caching reference (read 2026-08-26) — the
  10 GB default, the raise-by-admin clause, LRU-by-last-access eviction, the 7-day unused
  retention, and GitHub's own term *cache thrashing*. Denning, *The Working Set Model for
  Program Behavior* (CACM 1968) — a cache smaller than the working set thrashes; §3's 21.27 GiB
  logical working set against a 9.31 GiB ceiling is that condition stated in its original terms,
  and Denning's point that the failure is a *property of the ratio*, not of the replacement
  policy, is why tuning LRU cannot fix this. Belady, Nelson & Shedler (CACM 1969) — anomalous
  behaviour under replacement policies, the reason §2 measures the sweep rather than reasoning
  about it. Martin, REP/CCP/CRP (*Granularity*, C++ Report 1996) — round 3's axes, unchanged
  here.
