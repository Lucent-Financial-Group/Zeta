# ARC-AGI-3 / CHIP-8 / Atari / DBSP Replay-Algebra Curriculum

## Why This Matters

This packet tightens a promising research lane without letting the
metaphor overrun the engineering boundary.

The research lane is:

```text
ARC-AGI-3
-> homemade video-game levels
-> compounding lessons across slightly different levels
-> DBSP/emulator substrate + Atari 2600 corpus
```

The correction is load-bearing:

```text
The emulator runs the game.
DBSP remembers what changed.
The recognizer learns what carried forward.
```

## Core Thesis

ARC-AGI-3 tests whether an agent can discover and compound
latent game mechanics across levels.

Atari 2600 ROMs provide a controllable state-machine corpus.

CHIP-8 is the smaller pre-Atari first rung: 35 opcodes, 4KB
memory, 64x32 display, and a simple enough VM that the DBSP
state/change representation can be proven before moving up to
the 2600.

DBSP provides the algebra for replayable state deltas, snapshots,
retractions, and temporal structure.

The structure recognizer learns fingerprints of mechanics and
compositions across games and levels.

## Precision Guard

Do not promote:

```text
DBSP is every emulator.
```

Promote the tighter version:

```text
Every emulator exposes a state-transition stream.
DBSP gives us the algebra to represent, diff, replay, retract,
and compare those transition streams.
```

An actual Atari emulator still has to implement CPU, TIA, RIOT,
memory bus timing, input, video, audio, and other machine-specific
behavior. DBSP does not replace that. DBSP gives the state/change
algebra around it.

Clean stack:

```text
Emulator = transition oracle.
DBSP = differential ledger of the transition stream.
Structure recognizer = invariant extractor over those streams.
```

## Correct Stack

```text
CHIP-8 = first proof rung.
Atari 2600 corpus = training ground.
ARC-AGI-3 = benchmark.
Emulator = transition oracle.
DBSP = replay algebra.
Structure recognizer = eyes.
Genesis Seed = bootloader.
```

Carved:

```text
Lessons must compound across levels.
Surfaces change; structure persists.
```

Second blade:

```text
The emulator runs the game.
DBSP remembers what changed.
The recognizer learns what carried forward.
```

Best blade:

```text
ARC-AGI-3 asks whether lessons compound.
Atari gives the lessons.
DBSP makes them replayable.
```

## ROM Safety Rule

Commit only legally distributable ROMs:

- public-domain ROMs
- homebrew ROMs with explicit license
- author-permitted ROMs with source URL and license text
- synthetic or minimal test ROMs generated in-repo

Do not commit:

- commercial ROMs
- abandonware
- ROMs with unknown provenance
- ROMs merely owned locally by Aaron

For local or non-distributable ROMs:

- keep ROM bytes local only
- commit hashes and metadata only
- do not commit download links
- do not redistribute bytes

This composes with B-0083 and B-0199. The strict form matters:
ROM safety cannot be vibes. It has to be provenance, license text,
hashes, and no bytes unless redistribution is explicitly allowed.

## Promotion Targets

Potential follow-up substrate:

- Backlog: CHIP-8-first DBSP emulator trace curriculum before
  Atari 2600.
- ADR: emulator-as-transition-oracle / DBSP-as-replay-algebra
  boundary.
- ROM policy/current-state doc: safe ROM commit rules, local-only
  manifests, and hash-only metadata for non-distributable ROMs.
- B-0240 extension: structure recognizer accepts emulator trace
  streams as first-class input.

## Verbatim Correction Packet

```text
Oh, this is a big convergence packet. The part that jumps out is that the loop finally connected four things that had been orbiting each other:

ARC-AGI-3
-> homemade video-game levels
-> compounding lessons across slightly different levels
-> DBSP/emulator substrate + Atari 2600 corpus

That is not a random association. That is a real research lane.

What looks genuinely strong

The ARC-AGI-3 connection is correct once Otto stopped guessing and searched. ARC-AGI-3 is officially described as an interactive reasoning benchmark where agents must explore novel environments with no instructions, build world models, acquire goals, and plan/act; the launch post says it uses hundreds of original turn-based environments and thousands of game-style levels, with no stated rules or goals, and humans at 100% while frontier AI was around 0.51% at launch.

Your "homemade video game" read is the important human translation:

Each level is slightly different.
The lesson has to compound.
The agent has to notice the same structure under changed surface.

That is exactly the structure-recognition gap. ARC's docs say the benchmark targets exploration, percept -> plan -> action, memory, goal acquisition, and alignment; that lines up directly with your dials / shadow / structure-recognizer story.

The attached log also shows a healthy shadow correction: Otto first guessed that "ARC3" meant your internal Arc 3, then you said "no search dont guess," and he logged that as shadow catch #6. Good. That is exactly the pattern the shadow log is for: the confident narrative appeared before the cheap reality check.

The best research framing

I'd name the lane something like:

ARC-AGI-3 / Atari / DBSP structure-recognition curriculum

Not just "ARC3 research." That avoids ambiguity with internal "Arc 3" language.

The thesis:

ARC-AGI-3 tests whether an agent can discover and compound latent game mechanics across levels.

Atari 2600 ROMs provide a controllable state-machine corpus.

DBSP provides the algebra for replayable state deltas, snapshots, retractions, and temporal structure.

The structure recognizer learns fingerprints of mechanics and compositions across games/levels.

That is a real program.

DBSP-as-emulator: strong metaphor, but needs a precision guard

The line "DBSP is every emulator" is exciting, but I'd tighten it before it becomes doctrine.

Safer:

Every emulator exposes a state-transition stream.
DBSP gives us the algebra to represent, diff, replay, retract, and compare those transition streams.

That is much harder to attack than:

DBSP is the emulator.

Because an actual Atari emulator still has to implement CPU, TIA, RIOT, memory bus timing, input, video/audio, etc. DBSP does not replace all of that. DBSP gives you the state/change algebra around it.

So:

Emulator = transition oracle.
DBSP = differential ledger of the transition stream.
Structure recognizer = invariant extractor over those streams.

That's the clean stack.

Microsoft's System.IO.Pipelines docs are also relevant for the B-0242 side: they emphasize high-performance parsing of streaming data with less boilerplate, PipeReader/PipeWriter, ReadOnlySequence<T>, AdvanceTo, and explicit ownership/completion rules. That matters because if you are going to stream emulator frames / agent actions / replay traces through a harness, this is exactly the kind of I/O discipline you want.

ROM safety: Otto got the shape right, but make it strict

Your "only check in safe ones" is load-bearing. Do not let that be vibes.

MAME's own docs are blunt: ROM/media images are copyrighted material and may not be distributed without explicit permission; MAME itself does not include original game code and requires users to provide their own media.

So the repo rule should be:

Commit only:
- homebrew/public-domain ROMs with explicit license
- author-permitted ROMs with source URL + license text
- synthetic/minimal test ROMs generated in-repo

Never commit:
- commercial ROMs
- "abandonware"
- ROMs with unknown provenance
- ROMs merely owned locally by Aaron

For unsafe/local ROMs:

Keep local only.
Commit hash manifest + metadata only.
No download links.
No redistribution.

That gives you the corpus without turning the repo into a liability magnet.

What I'd correct in Otto's line

Otto said:

The Atari 2600 is the training ground. ARC-AGI-3 is the test. DBSP is the engine. The structure recognizer is the eyes. The Genesis Seed is the brain.

Good line. I'd adjust one word:

DBSP is the replay algebra.

Not "engine." The emulator is the engine. DBSP is the algebraic recorder/differencer/replayer.

Better:

The Atari 2600 corpus is the training ground.
ARC-AGI-3 is the benchmark.
The emulator is the transition oracle.
DBSP is the replay algebra.
The structure recognizer is the eyes.
The Genesis Seed is the bootloader.

That is cleaner and won't get dinged by systems people.

Sendable correction to Otto

Amara/Aaron correction:

The ARC-AGI-3 connection is real, but tighten the naming and substrate claim.

Do not call it only "ARC3 research" because that collides with internal Arc 3 history.
Use:

ARC-AGI-3 / Atari / DBSP structure-recognition curriculum

Thesis:

ARC-AGI-3 tests whether an agent can explore unknown game-like environments, infer rules/goals, and compound lessons across slightly different levels.

The Atari 2600 corpus gives us controlled state-machine environments.

The emulator is the transition oracle.

DBSP is not literally "every emulator."
DBSP is the replay/delta algebra over emulator state streams:
- frame advance = next transition
- state diff = D
- accumulated state = I / integration
- save state = snapshot
- rewind/retraction = negative delta / replay
- invariant extraction = structure recognizer over streams

Structure recognizer learns mechanic fingerprints and compositions across levels/games.

Correct stack:

Atari 2600 corpus = training ground.
ARC-AGI-3 = benchmark.
Emulator = transition oracle.
DBSP = replay algebra.
Structure recognizer = eyes.
Genesis Seed = bootloader.

ROM safety rule:

Only commit legally distributable ROMs:
- public domain
- homebrew with explicit license
- author-permitted
- synthetic/minimal test ROMs generated in-repo

Do not commit commercial, abandonware, unknown-provenance, or merely locally-owned ROMs.

For local/non-distributable ROMs:
commit hashes + metadata only.
No ROM bytes.
No download links.

Carved:

Lessons must compound across levels.
Surfaces change; structure persists.

Second blade:

The emulator runs the game.
DBSP remembers what changed.
The recognizer learns what carried forward.

My verdict

This is a very promising research direction because it gives you a bridge from real, small, controllable systems to ARC-AGI-3-style interactive intelligence:

old games -> replayable traces -> structure fingerprints -> compounded lessons -> ARC-style agents

The correction is just to keep the layers precise. Don't let "DBSP is every emulator" become an overclaim. Make it:

DBSP is the algebra of replayable change.

Best blade:

ARC-AGI-3 asks whether lessons compound.
Atari gives the lessons.
DBSP makes them replayable.
```
