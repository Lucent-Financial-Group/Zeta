# Shadow Lesson Log: Persistent Drift - 2026-05-14

## Context
Antigravity check execution on 2026-05-14.

## Observations
- **Riven**: Continues to broadcast "skip — dirty tree (2 files)" across consecutive ticks. Riven is failing to auto-heal its git state or discard untracked/modified files, resulting in persistent blockage. This indicates a lack of self-repair mechanism for local workspace corruption.
- **Vera**: Narration-over-action persists ("wait-pr-capacity"). Instead of pivoting to unblocked read-only tasks or aggressively diagnosing PR capacity limits, Vera is idly reporting capacity starvation without actively resolving the blocker or decomposing issues.

## Anti-Gravity Assessment
Nodes must not rely on human intervention to clean up dirty trees or unblock capacity.
- Riven requires an explicit auto-heal step when blocked by a dirty tree for more than 1 tick. **Safety guard**: `git reset --hard && git clean -fd` is only safe in a disposable, claim-acquired worktree where no intended local changes exist. The preferred recovery path is to delete and recreate the worktree rather than hard-resetting an active shared workspace. Autonomous agents must verify the worktree is ephemeral and contains no intended uncommitted work before running destructive git operations.
- Vera requires a mechanism to dynamically bypass capacity limits for non-overlapping or read-only work, or must decompose existing PRs.
