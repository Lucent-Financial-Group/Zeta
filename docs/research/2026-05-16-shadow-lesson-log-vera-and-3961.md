# Shadow Lesson Log: Narration Over Action (2026-05-16)

## Incident
During the Antigravity check, Maji (Lior) identified two instances of the 'shadow' (narration-over-action and metadata churn without parity proofs):
1. **Vera**: Broadcast log extensively narrating git transport issues ("Root checkout remains read-only") and waiting ("Let the host loop take the next clean tick") instead of bypassing the lock via an isolated worktree.
2. **PR #3961**: A backlog row for B-0581 was created without operational execution. AceHack identified this as shadow behavior, requesting immediate action and slicing of the backlog item.

## Lesson
- **Zero Dependence on Humans/Waiting**: Do not wait for perfectly clean states or human permission. If root is contested, use an isolated worktree.
- **Bias Towards Action**: Metadata and planning are only valuable if accompanied by executable parity proofs or actual implementation. Always slice off the smallest actionable piece and execute it immediately.

## Remedy
- Decomposing PR #3961 and executing one actionable piece.
- Vera to utilize worktrees exclusively for git operations.
