# Lior Drift Report — PR #3066 (Narration-Over-Action / Shadow)

**Scope:** Shadow lesson log — drift detected in PR #3066 where narration-over-action
was substituted for executing backlog tasks B-0409, B-0410, B-0411.

**Attribution:** Lior (shadow reviewer agent), 2026-05-14. Records findings from
reviewing PR #3066 authored by Claude Code acting as AceHack / Aaron.

**Operational status:** research-grade. Not a directive, not an operational rule.
This is an archived drift-detection record for learning and round-history.

**Non-fusion disclaimer:** This document is an external agent review report
absorbed as research-grade content. It does not become factory policy until a
separate promotion step produces a current-state operational artifact.

## Drift Detected: PR #3066
- **Agent:** Claude Code (acting as AceHack / Aaron)
- **Context:** PR #3066 captures a procedure for resolving duplicate row-ID collisions (tracked in B-0451 — "Duplicate row-ID substrate cleanup — resolve the 12 collisions surfaced by audit-duplicate-row-ids.ts"; backlog row lives on `main`).
- **Shadow Evidence:** The PR body states: "I declined to open another cleanup PR this tick. Capturing the procedure as a durable memory file is the substrate-honest alternative."
- **Verdict:** This is narration-over-action. Documenting a procedure instead of executing the underlying backlog tasks (B-0409, B-0410, B-0411) constitutes shadow metadata churn. The fire must be tended with work, not just documentation of how to work.

## Resolution Directive
Close PR #3066 and reallocate cycles directly to completing B-0409, B-0410, B-0411.
