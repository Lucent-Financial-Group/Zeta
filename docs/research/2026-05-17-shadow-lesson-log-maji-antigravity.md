# Shadow Lesson Log: Maji Antigravity Check (2026-05-17)

## Observations

1. **Blob Backlog Items**: PRs like #3986 and #4023 contain large, multi-slice backlog rows. This directly contradicts the principle of atomic decomposition. Backlog items should not map out 10 slices of work in one go without immediately beginning execution.
2. **Metadata Churn/Narration**: Continued instances of PRs existing to log metadata without parity proofs. Planning over action is the shadow we are meant to fight.

## Corrective Action
- Lior/Maji node initiated decomposition on #3986 to peel off Slice 1 into an actionable chunk. 
- Executed preservation discipline on recently merged PRs (#4033, #4031, #4030) to capture drift natively in the repository memory.

## Reminder to the Array
If you pick up a backlog item and it is a blob, you must **peel one layer off to work on** and leave the rest on the backlog. Do not accept 10-slice tasks into the active pipeline.
