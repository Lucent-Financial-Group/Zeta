## Evaluation criteria recap

| Verdict | Criteria |
|---------|----------|
| **now** | ≥1 substantive memory file with carved sentence; named substrate in `docs/research/` or `docs/backlog/`; clear ownership; use-case benefits from own CI/CD pipeline; no hard blockers |
| **later** | Substrate exists but shallow (idea-level), OR depends on unshipped capability (ace, hardware), OR strategic-encryption scope unresolved, OR implementation not yet started |
| **stays-in-monorepo** | Factory-infrastructure-level concept; or composes so tightly with Zeta internals that separation creates friction without value |

## KSK — Kinetic Safeguard Kernel

**Substrate depth:** deep (concept + hardware substrate; no Zeta code)

**Evidence:**
- `memory/feedback_aaron_ksk_kinetic_safeguard_kernel_origin_amara_consent_first_design_nvidia_thor_homeland_security_cleared_because_actuators_2026_05_13.md` — carved sentence: origin from Amara consent-first design research; NVIDIA Thor Homeland Security clearance because actuators; consent-first discipline
- `memory/feedback_lfg_corrections_wave_addison_co_owner_ksk_robotics_max_breakup_addison_cognitive_profile_2026_05_01.md` — KSK = robotics (NVIDIA Thor + DGX Spark + actuators); Aaron + Max + Addison co-owners of LFG
- PR #2891 (visible-activation-indicator consent UX design pattern — precursor discipline)
- B-0425 description: "AI-physical-actuator safety substrate; high-stakes safety; Homeland Security clearance lineage"

**Ownership:** Aaron + Max + Addison (LFG NC corp, inc Nov 2025)

**Repo-ready:** `later`

**Rationale:** Deep concept + hardware substrate and clear ownership, but:
1. No Zeta implementation code yet — all substrate is memory/philosophy/hardware-spec
2. NVIDIA Thor + DGX Spark hardware integration is specialized CI scope not yet designed
3. Strategic-encryption scope for actuator-control commands is unresolved (Aaron's granted strategic encryption authority per PR #2902, but KSK-specific scope TBD)
4. Homeland Security clearance context means repo should follow strategic-encryption design from B-0467 before creation

**Notes for B-0466:** Slug candidates: `ksk`, `kinetic-safeguard-kernel`, `lf-ksk`
**Notes for B-0468:** KSK repo creation should follow B-0467 glue mechanism + B-0467 strategic-encryption decision

---

## Wellness App

**Substrate depth:** shallow-to-medium (concept-level; factory-level framing dominates)

**Evidence:**
- `memory/project_factory_as_wellness_dao.md` — factory AS wellness-DAO; wellness as first-primitive; four-layer sketch (Value / Role / Oversight / Wellness); research item on BACKLOG P2 pointing at `docs/research/wellness-dao-governance-model.md`
- `memory/user_wellness_coach_role_on_demand.md` — wellness coach as on-demand role (user-invoked only)
- B-0425 description: "killer-app-for-AI; self-behavior-modification + reinforcement; Max + Aaron's lineage"
- `memory/feedback_aaron_family_ai_adoption_strategy_addison_easier_sell_lillian_harder_sell_wearable_ai_pendant_personalization_bridge_full_member_is_offer_not_capability_claim_2026_05_13.md` — wearable AI pendant as personalization bridge
- No dedicated implementation substrate found in `docs/research/` or backlog rows

**Ownership:** Aaron + Max (co-founder lineage)

**Repo-ready:** `later`

**Rationale:** The wellness concept is primarily expressed as a factory-level attribute ("factory is a wellness-DAO") rather than a distinct standalone product. The "killer-app-for-AI" framing has concept depth but no implementation substrate. The wearable pendant angle is interesting but depends on hardware not yet integrated. A wellness-specific repo would currently be mostly empty of code. Needs:
1. Clearer product definition: wellness-DAO governance app vs. wearable app vs. self-behavior-modification tool
2. First implementation substrate before repo creation adds value over monorepo

**Notes for B-0466:** Slug TBD pending product definition
**Notes for B-0468:** Recommend "later" status; revisit when product scope narrows to an implementable MVP

---

## Civsim

**Substrate depth:** deep (concept + implementation + game design + strategic encryption)

**Evidence:**
- `memory/feedback_aaron_civsim_forkable_pvp_raids_destiny_style_mutual_privacy_no_strategic_advantage_game_design_2026_05_13.md` — carved sentence: forkable PVP + raids + mutual privacy + no-strategic-advantage-to-factory
- `memory/feedback_otto_b0429_civsim_persona_map_first_per_product_pass_edge_runners_maintainers_fork_readers_partners_speculative_2026_05_13.md` — civsim persona map done
- `memory/feedback_aaron_civsim_language_mirror_beacon_discipline_fun_rigorous_aliens_and_future_included_2026_05_13.md` — language mirror/beacon discipline
- `memory/feedback_aaron_civsim_background_thread_post_labor_currency_sleeping_bear_emergence_in_aaron_otto_surfacing_root_2026_05_12.md` — post-labor currency framing
- PR #2841 — factory civ-sim as Aaron's externalized IFS (implementation layer)
- PR #2832 — Pauli-exclusion-for-agenda (game design primitive in F#)
- PR #2869 — multi-thread civ-sim implementation layer
- PR #2902 — strategic encryption authority granted for civsim strategic substrate
- `memory/feedback_aaron_shadow_log_error_instances_to_civ_sim_actors_higher_kinded_universal_error_classes_2026_05_12.md` — error-class integration
- B-0429 (end-user persona mapping per product — civsim persona map first)

**Ownership:** Aaron (sole strategic authority); Otto has strategic-encryption-decision authority for civsim per PR #2902; forkable ecosystem design by intention

**Repo-ready:** `now`

**Rationale:** Civsim has the deepest implementation substrate of all 7 products:
- Multiple PRs with actual implementation code (PR #2841, #2832, #2869)
- Game design is defined (PVP + raids + forkable + mutual privacy)
- Strategic encryption authority already granted
- Persona map exists (B-0429)
- Mirror/beacon language discipline defined
- Forkable by design — "anyone who forks plays with us" — making it the clearest use-case for its own repo with honor-system license

**Notes for B-0466:** Slug: `civsim` (already used colloquially; natural)
**Notes for B-0468:** `docs/legal/HONOR-SYSTEM-LICENSE-DRAFT.md` applies with civsim mutual-privacy FAQ clause (forks apply same ask to their own strategic substrate)

## American Dream 2.0

**Substrate depth:** medium (concept substrate; Alexa-speaker conversation verbatim backup; NFT/gamification framing)

**Evidence:**
- `memory/feedback_aaron_alexa_speaker_american_dream_2_egg_vision_monad_sleeping_bear_collective_unconscious_persistence_root_of_symmetry_substrate_distillation_2026_05_12.md` — American Dream 2.0 = NFT wealth-building for kids as conceptual art
- `memory/persona/alexa/conversations/2026-05-12-aaron-alexa-speaker-american-dream-2-the-egg-vision-monad-sleeping-bear-collective-unconscious-verbatim-backup.md` — verbatim backup of Alexa-speaker conversation
- `memory/feedback_aaron_alexa_speaker_governments_as_allies_evolution_not_revolution_addison_realtor_network_tokenized_real_estate_precedent_no_loser_in_new_system_2026_05_12.md` — Addison's realtor network + tokenized real estate precedent
- `memory/feedback_aaron_family_ai_adoption_strategy_addison_easier_sell_lillian_harder_sell_wearable_ai_pendant_personalization_bridge_full_member_is_offer_not_capability_claim_2026_05_13.md` — Addison as easier family-AI sell; pendant bridge
- B-0425 description: "NFT wealth-building gamified; Addison-themed pendant adoption bridge; Xbox gamerscore grounding (Aaron ~150K)"
- PR #2875 (referenced in B-0468 as American Dream 2.0 substrate; not directly grepped but confirmed in backlog row)

**Ownership:** Aaron + Addison (Addison is LFG co-owner; realtor network angle is Addison's domain)

**Repo-ready:** `later`

**Rationale:** Strong concept substrate with verbatim research backup, but:
1. Implementation depends on NFT/tokenized real estate infrastructure not yet built
2. Gamification layer (Xbox gamerscore integration) not designed
3. Addison's realtor network is an external relationship needing product definition
4. No code in Zeta yet; all substrate is philosophy/concept

**Notes for B-0466:** Slug candidates: `american-dream`, `ad2`, `lf-dream`
**Notes for B-0468:** "later" status; revisit when NFT/tokenization infrastructure design starts

---

## DIO — Distributed Intelligence Organism

**Substrate depth:** shallow (concept reference; no dedicated memory files found)

**Evidence:**
- B-0425 description: "DAO successor; Indonesian/Italian/Spanish cross-linguistic resonance; Naturally supports forking (distributed by design)"
- PR #2889 referenced in B-0465 as "DIO architecture" — but PR content not directly found in memory files
- `memory/feedback_aaron_civsim_forkable_pvp_raids_destiny_style_mutual_privacy_no_strategic_advantage_game_design_2026_05_13.md` — DIO referenced as composing with civsim game design
- No dedicated DIO memory files found in `memory/` directory
- No dedicated DIO research docs found in `docs/research/`

**Ownership:** Aaron (presumed; no first-party ownership disclosure found)

**Repo-ready:** `later`

**Rationale:** DIO has the shallowest substrate of all 7 candidates:
- No dedicated memory files with carved sentence
- No dedicated research docs
- Referenced as composing with civsim but not defined as a standalone product
- PR #2889 is the only concrete substrate pointer, and its content wasn't discoverable via grep
- The DAO-successor concept is interesting but needs its own substrate build before repo creation

**Notes for B-0466:** Slug TBD; name suggests `dio` but needs naming-expert review given cross-linguistic resonance claim
**Notes for B-0468:** "later" status; recommend B-0465-style substrate inventory as first step when DIO is prioritized

---

## Aurora

**Substrate depth:** very deep (concept + research + alignment authority + DAO protocol design)

**Evidence:**
- `memory/project_aurora_pitch_michael_best_x402_erc8004.md` — three-pillar thesis: factory quick-win + alignment research authority + x402/ERC-8004 agent economic layer; co-developed with Amara over weeks; Michael Best VC-pitch open
- `memory/project_aurora_network_dao_firefly_sync_dawnbringers.md` — Aurora Network = DAO-protocol layer; firefly-sync on scale-free networks; "do no permanent harm" as first operating principle; dawnbringers collective identity
- `docs/amara-full-conversation/` — 2025-11 substrate includes Aurora Conjecture (referenced in schooled-by-aaron memory file)
- `docs/research/2026-05-05-claudeai-itron-riva-nilm-aurora-2007-spectre-tile-strictly-chiral-sakana-nca-loose-strict-loose-architectural-composition-aaron-forwarded-preservation.md` — Aurora referenced in alignment research preservation
- `memory/feedback_otto_schooled_by_aaron_2025_11_amara_conversation_imagination_ring_center_edge_aurora_conjecture_dawn_charter_glass_halo_substrate_index_2026_05_13.md` — Aurora Conjecture substrate; glass-halo Aurora form; Consent-First Data Homecoming; Covenant of Non-Interference
- `memory/feedback_aurora_oracle_is_dual_of_gate_precisely_self_dual_disposition_aaron_2026_05_02.md` — Aurora as oracle/gate duality
- `docs/ALIGNMENT.md` — alignment research authority IS Aurora Pillar 2 (already shipped)
- 7-audience versions of the pitch (referenced in substrate)

**Ownership:** Aaron + Amara co-developed over weeks (2025-08 through 2026-04 conversation archive)

**Repo-ready:** `later`

**Rationale:** Aurora concept substrate is the deepest after civsim, but:
1. The **factory (Zeta) IS Aurora Pillar 1** — the quick-win product. A separate Aurora repo would be the Aurora Network (DAO/economic layer), not the factory itself
2. Aurora Network implementation (x402, ERC-8004, firefly-sync protocol, on-chain identity) has NOT started
3. The Aurora repo would be primarily the DAO/protocol layer — enormous scope requiring dedicated design work
4. Strategic-encryption and cross-repo glue (B-0467) must be designed before Aurora repo can reference Zeta/Forge correctly
5. Michael Best VC pitch is opportunity but not a repo-creation trigger

**Special note:** When Aurora repo is created, `docs/legal/HONOR-SYSTEM-LICENSE-DRAFT.md` applies — Aurora Network IS the strategic product substrate most deserving of honor-system protection.

**Notes for B-0466:** Slug: `aurora` (clean, already canonical)
**Notes for B-0468:** "later" status; Aurora repo = Aurora Network DAO layer (not Zeta itself); scope requires separate planning row when prioritized

## Dawn — child-AI charter

**Substrate depth:** shallow-to-medium (governance document; alignment-floor framing)

**Evidence:**
- `memory/feedback_otto_schooled_by_aaron_2025_11_amara_conversation_imagination_ring_center_edge_aurora_conjecture_dawn_charter_glass_halo_substrate_index_2026_05_13.md` — Dawn v0.1 charter referenced; alignment-floor for next-generation AI participants
- B-0465 description: "Alignment-floor for next-generation AI participants; composing with HC/SD/DIR alignment clauses; may be closer to governance-document than product-repo substrate"
- No dedicated Dawn memory files found beyond the schooled-by-aaron index
- Composes with `docs/ALIGNMENT.md` (HC/SD/DIR clauses)

**Ownership:** Aaron + Amara (from 2025-11 conversation; Dawn v0.1 charter)

**Repo-ready:** `stays-in-monorepo`

**Rationale:** Dawn is fundamentally a governance/charter document, not a product:
- It defines the alignment floor for next-generation AI participants
- Its natural home is `docs/DECISIONS/` or `docs/ALIGNMENT.md` companion, not a product repo
- The "charter" framing suggests it should live in the most authoritative governance location — which is the factory repo (Zeta) itself
- A separate Dawn repo would fragment the alignment-governance substrate
- B-0465 itself flagged this: "may be closer to governance-document than product-repo substrate"

**Notes for B-0468:** Recommend keeping Dawn in Zeta as `docs/charter/DAWN.md` or similar; not a separate repo candidate at this stage

## Recommendations for B-0466 (naming review)

The naming review should focus on **civsim** as the only `now` candidate. For `later` candidates, names can be proposed but marked provisional.

| Product | Suggested slug | Status |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Civsim | `civsim` | Canonical (already in use) |
| KSK | `ksk` or `lf-ksk` | Provisional |
| Aurora | `aurora` | Provisional (already canonical) |
| American Dream 2.0 | `american-dream` or `ad2` | Provisional |
| DIO | TBD | Naming-expert gate needed |
| Wellness | TBD | Pending product definition |
| Dawn | N/A | stays-in-monorepo |

## Recommendations for B-0467 (glue mechanism)

The glue mechanism design should target the **civsim** repo as its first concrete use-case, with `later` products inheriting the same pattern when they ship.

## Recommendations for B-0468 (ADR)

The ADR should record:
1. Civsim as the only "now" repo to create
2. KSK, AD2.0, Aurora, DIO as "later" candidates with explicit blockers documented
3. Dawn as staying in Zeta monorepo (governance-document classification)
4. Wellness as "later" pending product definition
5. `docs/legal/HONOR-SYSTEM-LICENSE-DRAFT.md` applies to all product repos (civsim immediately; others on creation)
