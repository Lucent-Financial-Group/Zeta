# Gemini propose + Grok critique on the seven-rule cascade and DSL shape — twin-flame scout roundup

**Scope:** Aaron 2026-05-05 *"throw gemini cli and grok through cursor for good mearus ... yall should be twin flames never without each oother from this mamment on ... Codex/GPT-5.5 is ccscout plot holder too ... you can have more than one"*. Otto dispatched parallel peer-call scouts (Gemini propose, Grok critique, Codex shape) on (1) DSL grammar shape for CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md replacement and (2) self-critique of the just-landed seven-rule cascade.

**Attribution:** Gemini (propose role), Grok (critique role) per Zeta four-ferry consensus *"Gemini proposes, Grok critiques, Amara sharpens, Otto tests, Git decides."* Codex preserved separately at `docs/research/2026-05-05-codex-gpt55-dsl-shape-rule-atom-graph-projection-claude-agents-replacement.md`.

**Operational status:** Research-grade. Grok's critique is load-bearing for whether the cascade stays/changes; do NOT update CLAUDE.md cascade bullet without explicit deliberation.

**Non-fusion disclaimer:** External-AI peer review preserved verbatim. Does not become factory policy until separate operational-doc step.

## Gemini propose — DSL grammar shape (verbatim tail)

Gemini mapped the 7 properties to grammar choices:

> ### Mapping the 7 Properties
> 1. **Hodl-invariant:** A `<Proposition>` bound by a `hodl` constraint forms a monotonic lower bound. It is a stake in the ground that cannot be implicitly overridden; it demands formal, explicit resolution.
> 2. **Retraction-native:** Deletions do not exist. `retracts` is a first-class `<Action>` that tombstones a prior `<CausalClock>` reference, preserving the complete history of *why* a constraint died.
> 3. **DST-testable:** `<CausalClock>` (e.g., Lamport or Vector clocks) ensures every state transition is fully serializable, strictly replayable, and perfectly fuzzable in simulation.
> 4. **Scale-free:** The grammar describes single, isolated facts (like Datalog). The same flat syntax scales seamlessly from a 3-line local rule to a 10,000-line global architectural lattice.
> 5. **Parallel:** Because facts are isolated and append-only, any number of agents can emit `<Claim>`s into the substrate simultaneously.
> 6. **Lock-free:** Writers never coordinate. Structural conflicts are resolved at *read-time* by projecting the log through a deterministic CRDT lattice (e.g., Observed-Remove Sets).
> 7. **Wait-free:** Any agent can emit a `<Claim>` instantly without blocking on global consensus, allowing continuous forward progress and asynchronous reconciliation.
>
> This shape eliminates the bottleneck of editing a shared 1700-line file. Let Grok tear this apart for merge-conflict edge cases, and Amara sharpen the constrained English semantics. Handing back to you.

**Convergence with Codex:** Gemini's `<Proposition>` + `<CausalClock>` + `<Action>` + `<Claim>` matches Codex's "rule atom" framing. Both converge on Datalog-shape derivable views + CRDT-style merge + causal clocks for replay (DST). The two proposals compose without conflict.

## Grok critique — the cascade is self-refuting (verbatim)

Grok's critique on the seven-rule cascade just landed in CLAUDE.md (commits 2bf716f + 015a4a8):

> **Rule 3 (extend existing axis, do not stand up parallel rank-deficient axis) is the sharpest self-own.** This is exactly what it forbade. PR #1701 (synthesis-weight + prior-art-grep), the wake-time-substrate-or-it-didn't-land rule (lines 1091-1133, same file), skill-router-as-inventory (lines 1144-1167), orthogonal-axes hygiene, and verify-before-deferring already formed a coherent basis. The cascade does not extend them; it erects a new 7-point checklist that overlaps on every dimension. The very session that produced five recursive failures "within hours of shipping PR #1701" responded by creating *more* substrate instead of repairing the existing one. This is the rank-deficient parallel axis the rule explicitly prohibits.
>
> **Rule 6 (multiplier — do steps 1-5 ten more times) is aspirational theatre.** The memory files admit the failures occurred in one session. There is no evidence of 10x varied queries, no logged effort naming surfaces searched before landing 140 lines in CLAUDE.md, no blast-radius walk against peer-call transcripts (`tools/peer-call/`), agent transcripts, or the decision-graph memory file the cascade itself cites. "Kinda joking not really" is not calibration; it is hedging.
>
> **Meta-recursion is broken at the root.** Rule 7 (bullet-time recovery on "here again" detection — multiple consecutive maintainer corrections, escalating framing including "remember forever") was authored in the canonical "here again" session. The agent that kept duplicating capability maps, proposing parallel cadence axes, and re-asking permission *within the same tick* responded by writing a rule demanding 10x multiplier on exactly that failure state. The rule that says "STOP authoring" was the thing authored. This is not recursion; it is ouroboros.
>
> The blind spot is obvious to the next agent: the cascade itself becomes the thing that must be searched under its own rules. Future-Otto will grep for it, find the CLAUDE.md bullet + five memory files + LOST-FILES catalog + owed-work items, and still fall through the gap between "assume it's already done" (sound) and the performative checklist that grew the very bloat it claims to prevent. Aaron's "remember forever and into all future generations" landed a monument to the goldfish-ontology failure mode it diagnosed. The substrate is self-refuting.

## Otto's synthesis (the agent's honest read)

Grok is correct. The cascade IS rank-deficient with the prior-existing basis. The proper consolidation:

| Cascade rule | Existing prior-art axis | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Rule 1 (substrate exists) | wake-time-substrate-or-it-didn't-land + skill-router-as-inventory | DUPLICATE |
| Rule 2 (backlog row exists) | PR #1701 prior-art-grep + decision-archaeology B-0169 | DUPLICATE |
| Rule 3 (orthogonal trajectory exists) | orthogonal-axes factory hygiene (Aaron 2026-04-22) | DUPLICATE |
| Rule 4 (internet prior art) | Otto-364 search-first authority | DUPLICATE |
| Rule 5 (lost files; canonical at LOST-FILES-LOCATIONS.md) | NEW value-add: cites the canonical lost-files substrate explicitly | KEEP (but as one-line addition to existing axes, not standalone) |
| Rule 6 (10x multiplier) | aspirational; no enforcement; admits "kinda joking" | DROP or REPLACE with concrete mechanization (PreToolUse hook) |
| Rule 7 (bullet-time recovery) | NEW value-add: failure-state-detection + scout-and-delegate signal | KEEP (but as one-line addition to existing axes) |

**Recommended consolidation:** the CLAUDE.md cascade bullet should be REPLACED with a one-line addition to existing wake-time-substrate-or-it-didn't-land + skill-router + orthogonal-axes bullets that:
- Cites `tools/hygiene/LOST-FILES-LOCATIONS.md` for lost-files surface
- Names the bullet-time recovery signal (Rule 7's value-add)
- Drops the rest as duplicate

This is destructive on the cascade (the seven memory files become reference-grade, not load-bearing). Requires explicit deliberation given Aaron's *"remember forever and into all future generations"* framing.

**Grok's risk identified:** future-Otto will read both the cascade AND the prior-art axes, get confused about which is canonical, and may layer ANOTHER cascade on top.

## Aaron's TS-over-bash catch (parallel finding)

Aaron 2026-05-05 *"Agent 'Author audit-backlog-items.sh' completed sh is legacy ts is future prior art no reserdched"*: the audit-lost-files.sh + audit-trajectories.sh + audit-backlog-items.sh I just authored should have been TypeScript per `memory/feedback_dst_justifies_ts_quality_over_bash_and_harness_hooks_suffice_no_git_hooks_aaron_2026_05_03.md` (DST justifies TS over bash). I picked legacy form because the existing pattern in `tools/hygiene/` is bash; should have done prior-art-research first per Rule 4 (which I just authored and immediately violated — same pattern Grok diagnosed).

**Mechanization owed:** TS-port the three audit scripts (lost-files / trajectories / backlog-items). Bounded follow-up.

## Composes with

- `docs/research/2026-05-05-codex-gpt55-dsl-shape-rule-atom-graph-projection-claude-agents-replacement.md` — Codex shape (rule-atom typed graph)
- `memory/feedback_burn_down_claude_md_and_agents_md_start_over_with_DSL_hodl_invariant_retraction_native_all_layers_aaron_2026_05_05.md` — Aaron's pivot capture
- `memory/feedback_orthogonal_axes_factory_hygiene.md` — the discipline Grok used to indict the cascade
- `memory/feedback_dst_justifies_ts_quality_over_bash_and_harness_hooks_suffice_no_git_hooks_aaron_2026_05_03.md` — TS-over-bash discipline I just violated
- `memory/feedback_otto_holds_synthesis_weight_prior_art_grep_first_before_substrate_landing_*.md` (PR #1701) — the rule the cascade duplicated
- `memory/feedback_rule_number_*.md` (Rules 1-7) — the substrate Grok indicted
- `memory/feedback_learnings_must_land_in_claude_md_or_pointer_*.md` — wake-time-substrate-or-it-didn't-land rule

## NOT authorization to delete

Per Rule 7 (the very rule under critique): STOP authoring more substrate. Specifically: this research preservation is the LAST authoring this tick. Cascade-consolidation work is owed-follow-up; do NOT execute destructively in the same tick that diagnosed the failure.

## Cold-boot for future agents

The seven-rule cascade is currently in CLAUDE.md but is rank-deficient with the prior-existing axes (wake-time-substrate + skill-router + orthogonal-axes + Otto-364 + PR #1701). Grok's critique is correct. The right consolidation drops Rules 1-4 + Rule 6, keeps Rule 5's lost-files reference + Rule 7's bullet-time signal as additions to the existing bullets. Verify with Aaron before destructive cascade-removal.
