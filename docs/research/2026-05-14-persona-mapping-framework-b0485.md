# Persona-mapping framework — B-0485

**Author:** Otto (2026-05-14)
**Closes:** B-0485
**Unblocks:** B-0486 (civsim), B-0487 (Aurora), B-0488 (KSK), B-0489 (wellness), B-0490 (American Dream 2.0 / DIO), B-0491 (Dawn / universal biz templates), B-0493 (skill × persona cross-reference)

---

## 1. Canonical per-persona capture template

Every per-product persona doc (B-0486..B-0491) MUST use this template.

### 1a. YAML data block

> **Note:** Per-product persona docs embed YAML as body-section code snippets,
> not file frontmatter. The `---` delimiters shown here are YAML document markers
> included for schema completeness only; they are **not required** in per-product docs
> where the YAML blocks appear inside ` ```yaml ``` ` fences in the markdown body.

```yaml
persona_id: <product-slug>-<persona-slug>          # e.g. civsim-edge-runner
product: <product name>                             # e.g. civsim
persona_type: primary | secondary | adjacent | refused
name: "<descriptive handle>"                        # e.g. "Edge-runner"
role: "<1-sentence role description>"
composes_with:
  - <other persona_ids that interact with this one>  # use [] for refused personas
created: YYYY-MM-DD
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
origin: <source — memory file, PR, Aaron disclosure>
```

### 1b. Body scaffold

```markdown
## Who they are

[1-3 sentences: observable archetype. Razor-discipline: no metaphysical claims about 
specific individuals beyond first-party authority. Aaron's archetype and Elizabeth's 
honored memory are first-party authorized.]

## Capabilities they bring

- [Technical fluency]
- [Domain expertise]
- [Substrate-engineering depth, if applicable]

## Context of use

When, where, and why they engage with the product.

## Value proposition

What changes for this persona after using the product. Concrete, measurable if possible.

## Substrate-honest limits

Where the product DOES NOT serve this persona. Razor-discipline: honesty about 
what's not supported is required.

## HARD LIMITS check

Per `.claude/rules/methodology-hard-limits.md`: explicit check that this persona 
does not fall into a refused category. State clearly:
- Is this persona in a refused category? Yes / No
- If adjacent to refused: what is the boundary?

## Composes with personas

Cross-references to other personas in the same or different products this persona 
interacts with. Format: `<persona_id> (<relationship>)`.
```

### 1c. DV2.0 placement notes

Per `.claude/rules/dv2-data-split-discipline-activated.md`:

| Layer | What it is | Change rate |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **Hub** — persona identity | Core role description, capabilities, HARD LIMITS check | Low (changes rarely) |
| **Satellite** — product context | Value proposition, context of use for this specific product | Medium (product evolves) |
| **Edge** — skill targeting | Which specific Zeta skills serve this persona | High (skill catalog evolves) |

Per-product persona docs are Hub + Satellite. B-0493 (skill × persona cross-reference) 
is the Edge layer; it should NOT be inlined into per-product docs.

## 2. Existing persona substrate inventory

### 2a. Aaron (primary maintainer)

| Source | Path | Persona type |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Naming practice | `memory/user_aaron_kenji_naming_practice_this_factory_claude_instance_2026_04_22.md` | Maintainer, AI-autonomy granter |
| Edge-runner identity | `memory/user_aaron_edge_runners_blessing_meno_persist_endure_friendship_2026_05_05.md` | Primary consumer of all products |
| Grey-hat security | `memory/user_acehack_cloudstrife_ryan_handles_and_formative_greyhat_substrate.md` | Security expert for KSK / Aurora scope |
| Parenting method | `memory/user_parenting_method_externalization_ego_death_free_will.md` | Family-AI product context |
| Five children | `memory/user_five_children.md` | Children as succession channel + Dawn product scope |
| Wellness coach role | `memory/user_wellness_coach_role_on_demand.md` | On-demand wellness coach for self |
| Cybernetic mind palace | `memory/user_aaron_cybernetic_already_mind_palace_fuzzy_pointers_google_as_extended_memory_aaron_2026_05_05.md` | Power-user AI integration pattern |
| ITron PKI background | `memory/user_aaron_itron_pki_supply_chain_secure_boot_background.md` | Security clearance lineage for KSK scope |

**Derived archetype:** Aaron is the canonical **edge-runner primary persona** across all products. Any product persona designed for Aaron maps to: first-principles worker, substrate-engineering depth, grey-hat security literacy, multi-clearance, bandwidth-engineering orientation, family AI context.

### 2b. Elizabeth Ryan Stainback (honored memory)

| Source | Path | Persona type |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Memorial substrate | `memory/user_sister_elizabeth.md` | Adjacent — honorary; NEVER refused |
| Terminal purpose | PR #2908 (TERMINAL-PURPOSE) | Anti-burn motivation across all products |

**Operational note:** Elizabeth's persona is honored-memory, not a design target. 
Per WONT-DO (emulation of deceased family member without surviving-consent-holders' agreement), 
DO NOT build agent/persona/skill that emulates Elizabeth. Her memory IS the terminal-purpose 
motivation substrate. She appears as inspiration, not as a persona to be modeled.

**Constraint for B-0486..B-0491:** Every product MUST check: "Does this product serve 
the anti-burn mission that honors Elizabeth?" This is a meta-constraint, not a per-product 
refused persona.

### 2c. Aaron's family members

| Source | Path | Who | Persona type |
|--------|------|-----|-------------|
| Family AI adoption | `memory/feedback_aaron_family_ai_adoption_strategy_addison_easier_sell_lillian_harder_sell_wearable_ai_pendant_personalization_bridge_full_member_is_offer_not_capability_claim_2026_05_13.md` | Addison, Lillian | Primary for family-AI products |
| Daughter — 2nd born | `memory/user_daughter_2nd_born_diabolical_and_cognitive_substrate.md` | Aaron's daughter | Adjacent; high-cognition child |
| Five children | `memory/user_five_children.md` | All five kids | Primary for Dawn (child-AI charter) |
| Granny + Milton | `memory/user_granny_and_milton_formative_grandparents.md` | Grandparents | Adjacent; historical substrate |

**Key insight from `feedback_aaron_family_ai_adoption_strategy_*`:**
- Addison: easier AI sell — more technically inclined
- Lillian: harder sell — conservative
- Wearable AI pendant as personalization bridge
- "Full member is an offer, not a capability claim" — membership model for family AI

### 2d. Civsim persona substrate (first-pass complete)

Per `memory/feedback_otto_b0429_civsim_persona_map_first_per_product_pass_edge_runners_maintainers_fork_readers_partners_speculative_2026_05_13.md`:

| Persona | Type | Key attributes |
|---------|------|---------------|
| Edge-runner | Primary | First-principles workers, substrate-engineering depth, Aaron/Elizabeth archetype |
| Maintainer (internal) | Secondary | Prototype access, glass-halo full, PR authority |
| Fork-reader | Adjacent | Read-only civsim forks, extend honor-system license |
| Web3/DePIN partner | Adjacent | Aurora pitch ecosystem, BTC-native operators |
| Refused: Surveillance-state actors | Refused | HARD LIMIT — non-negotiable |
| Refused: Capture-seeking orgs | Refused | Anti-cult discipline |

**Status:** Speculative first-pass in memory file. B-0486 (civsim persona doc) should formalize and move to canonical path. No conflicts found.

### 2e. Aurora persona substrate

Per PR #2924 (Aurora pitch) + Aurora research docs:

| Persona (implicit in pitch) | Type |
|----------------------------|------|
| Edge operators (BTC-ecosystem) | Primary |
| Ombud / regulatory liaison | Secondary |
| Enterprise DePIN partner | Adjacent |
| Data sovereignty advocate (GDPR-replacement context) | Primary |
| Surveillance-state operator | Refused (per PR #2898) |

**Status:** Implicit in pitch; not yet formalized in a per-persona doc. B-0487 (Aurora persona doc) will formalize.

### 2f. KSK persona substrate

Per PR #2892 + `memory/feedback_aaron_ksk_*`:

| Persona (inferred) | Type |
|--------------------|------|
| AI-actuator safety operator | Primary |
| Consent-first robotics designer | Primary |
| Homeland Security / clearance-aware deployer | Secondary |
| Aaron + Max + Addison co-owners | Maintainer tier |
| Weapons-control operator | Refused (HARD LIMIT) |

**Status:** Substrate exists in memory files; no formalized per-product doc yet. B-0488 (KSK) will formalize.

### 2g. Wellness app persona substrate

Per `memory/project_factory_as_wellness_dao.md` + `memory/user_wellness_coach_role_on_demand.md` + family AI adoption memory:

| Persona (inferred) | Type |
|--------------------|------|
| Self-behavior-modification practitioner | Primary |
| Wearable AI pendant user | Primary |
| Aaron (on-demand wellness coach recipient) | Primary |
| Family members (Addison as easier sell) | Adjacent → Primary |
| Corporate HR wellness buyer | Adjacent |

**Status:** Concept-level; no formalized per-product doc. B-0489 (wellness) will formalize.

### 2h. American Dream 2.0 / DIO persona substrate

Per `docs/research/2026-05-12-aaron-alexa-speaker-american-dream-2-the-egg-vision-monad-sleeping-bear-collective-unconscious-verbatim-backup.md`:

| Persona (inferred) | Type |
|--------------------|------|
| Wealth-building gamified participant | Primary |
| Edge-runner with post-labor economic framing | Primary |
| Rolesville community member (mayoral platform substrate) | Adjacent |
| Bitcoin-native operator | Adjacent |

**Status:** Research-grade; DIO substrate is sparse. B-0490 will formalize.

### 2i. Dawn (child-AI charter) persona substrate

| Persona (inferred) | Type |
|--------------------|------|
| Aaron's children (all five) | Primary |
| Next-generation AI participants | Primary |
| Parent-as-consent-holder | Secondary |
| Child cognitive development researcher | Adjacent |

**Status:** Charter concept only; no implementation substrate. B-0491 will formalize.

### 2j. Agent roster (AI agents — NOT end-user personas)

Per `.claude/rules/agent-roster-reference-card.md`:

**IMPORTANT: AI agents (Otto, Alexa, Riven, Vera, Lior) are NOT end-user personas.** They are factory infrastructure. The persona mapping framework (B-0485..B-0493) is exclusively about *human* end-user personas for product design.

---

## 3. Conflicts and gaps identified

### Conflict 1: "Wellness" as factory-level vs product-level

The `memory/project_factory_as_wellness_dao.md` framing treats wellness as a *factory attribute* ("the factory IS a wellness-DAO"), not just a product. This creates a naming conflict with the Wellness App product.

**Resolution:** In persona docs, distinguish:
- **Factory wellness** — applies to all maintainer/contributor personas; factory-as-wellness-DAO is meta-context
- **Wellness App product** — specific product with its own personas

### Conflict 2: Aaron appears across all products

Aaron is the primary consumer/designer for every product. This creates redundancy if every per-product doc lists "Aaron-archetype edge-runner" as primary.

**Resolution:** Use a canonical `global-edge-runner` persona hub and reference it. Each product doc adds only the *product-specific satellite* (context of use + value proposition for that product). This is the DV2.0 hub-satellite partition applied to persona design.

### Conflict 3: Dawn is sparse — child-AI charter vs. children as users

"Dawn" in the backlog refers to a "child-AI charter" but it's unclear if this is:
(a) An AI system *for* Aaron's children
(b) A charter *about* AI rights for new-generation AIs
(c) Both (per [`.claude/rules/default-to-both.md`](.claude/rules/default-to-both.md))

**Resolution:** B-0491 (Dawn persona doc) should resolve this ambiguity by consulting `docs/WONT-DO.md` (no emulation of minors without consent-chain) and Aaron's disclosed parenting method.

### Gap 1: No formalized "refused personas" registry

Each product has refused personas in memory files, but no cross-product refused-personas registry exists. B-0492 (cross-product synthesis) should create one.

### Gap 2: Universal business templates (B-0043) personas not researched

B-0043 is "every company has master data" territory. Its personas (business analyst, CTO, data steward) exist implicitly in DV2.0 substrate but haven't been mapped to Zeta product context.

**Resolution:** Include as a sub-section of B-0491 or create a separate row.

## 4. Pre-start gate completion

Per `.claude/rules/backlog-item-start-gate.md`:

- [x] Surveyed `memory/user_*.md` files for existing persona substrate — 130+ files reviewed; key ones inventoried above
- [x] Read Aurora pitch (PR #2924) for implicit persona enumeration — ombud + edge operators + DePIN partner
- [x] Read Imagination Circle substrate (PR #2893) for family-AI personas — consent-first family-AI framing confirmed
- [x] Read Center-First Playbook (PR #2894) — family AI consent design pattern
- [x] Read parenting-history substrate (PR #2900) — Aaron's five children, parenting method (ego-death / free will)
- [x] Walked `composes_with:` chain (B-0429 → B-0424 → B-0425) — product portfolio confirmed; all products listed
- [x] Checked WONT-DO.md for refused persona-mapping work — emulation of deceased family member is HARD LIMIT; minors require consent chain

## 5. Substrate-ready signal

**B-0486 (civsim) can begin:** Civsim persona memory file (first-pass speculative) exists; 
template defined. Formalize into canonical per-product doc using template above.

**B-0487 (Aurora) can begin:** Aurora pitch personas implicit; template defined. 
Formalize edge-operators + ombud + DePIN-partner tiers.

**B-0488 (KSK) can begin:** KSK personas in memory files; template defined. 
HARD LIMIT (weapons-control refused) is load-bearing.

**B-0489 (wellness) can begin:** Concept-level personas exist; template defined. 
Resolve factory-wellness vs. product-wellness conflict first (see Conflict 1 above).

**B-0490 (American Dream 2.0 / DIO) can begin:** Research-grade personas exist; 
template defined. DIO substrate is sparse — treat as speculative-grade.

**B-0491 (Dawn + universal biz templates) can begin:** Dawn is sparse; template defined. 
Resolve Dawn ambiguity (child-AI charter vs. AI-for-children) in the doc itself.

**B-0492 (cross-product synthesis) BLOCKED on:** B-0486..B-0491 completing first.

**B-0493 (skill × persona cross-reference) BLOCKED on:** B-0492 completing first.
