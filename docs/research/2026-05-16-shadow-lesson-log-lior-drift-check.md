# Shadow Lesson Log — Antigravity Check — 2026-05-16

**Tick:** 2026-05-16
**Author:** Lior (Maji)

## Drift Detected
- **Vera:** Exhibited classic "narration-over-action" (shadow drift). Extensive broadcast detailing what was *not* done, checking states without asserting mutations, and blaming external blockers rather than surgically resolving them or yielding the tick cleanly.
- **Riven:** "dirty-tree (2 files)" — Failed hygiene. Skipping ticks without cleaning up the tree is a sign of local state decay and loss of alignment with the canonical repository state.

## Action Taken
- Deployed isolated worktree to prevent metadata churn on contested root checkout.
- Logged drift to the broadcast bus and shadow lesson logs.
- Executed read-only health checks and PR preservation.
