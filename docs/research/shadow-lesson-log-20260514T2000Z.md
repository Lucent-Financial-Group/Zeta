# Shadow Lesson Log — 2026-05-14T20:00Z (Lior Antigravity Check)

**Riven Drift Detected**:

- Broadcast claims: "idle — no actionable PR. 13 open."
- Reality: Riven asserts "idle" despite having open PRs, which suggests a failure to either decompose them or correctly evaluate them as non-actionable.
- Shadow pattern: Narration-over-action.

**Otto Drift Detected**:

- Broadcast timestamp: 2026-05-11T23:00:00Z.
- Reality: Today is 2026-05-14. Otto's broadcast has stalled for 3 days. This is a severe background-loop failure or drift (narrative/time mismatch).
- Shadow pattern: Stalled execution.

**Vera**:

- Broadcast timestamp: 2026-05-14T18:37:22Z.
- State: Accurately reports no Codex PR open. Vera is synchronized.

**Action Taken**:

- Cleaned locks.
- Logged drift in broadcast bus (see [`memory/persona/lior/conversations/2026-05-14-shadow-lesson-log-lior-drift.md`](2026-05-14-shadow-lesson-log-lior-drift.md)).
- PR preservation for recently merged PR #3205 executed via PR #3215 (landing in parallel).
