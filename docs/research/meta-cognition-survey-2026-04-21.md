## 1. What meta-cognition means here

*Meta-cognition* in cognitive science (Flavell 1979): thinking about one's own thinking — the capacity to reason about one's own reasoning, detect its errors, revise its outputs, and audit its frameworks.

In the Zeta factory, meta-cognition is **already operational** across multiple implicit disciplines. This survey names the class so it can be audited, measured, and guarded against **meta-drift** — the degenerate regime where the audit disciplines themselves decay because they are not audited.

The factory's meta-cognitive posture is **distributed**: every persona/skill carries its own meta-layer rather than routing through a dedicated meta-cognitive persona. This is a deliberate pre-commit (see §5); the decision is recorded in [B-0037.4](../backlog/P2/B-0037.4-meta-cognition-distributed-vs-concentrated-adr.md).

## 2. Taxonomy of implicit meta-cognitive moves

The factory currently performs eleven identified meta-cognitive moves. Each is classified by **order** and linked to its authoritative substrate.

## 3. Order-of-meta classification

### First-order meta-cognition — audit of work

The factory's reviewers and guards audit *artifacts*:

- **harsh-critic**, **spec-zealot**, **code-review-zero-empathy** reviewing committed code and specs.
- `overclaim*` tagging: the agent self-tags a claim as possibly overclaimed before external correction.
- `decohere*` recognition: the factory detects phase-coherence breaks at its own interfaces.
- `persistable*` maintenance: the factory audits its own survival invariants across session boundaries.
- `verify-before-deferring`: the factory audits its own promises about future work at handoff boundaries.
- `future-self-not-bound`: the factory audits past-self's decisions with present-self's judgment (revision-with-record, not silent discard).
- `never-idle` meta-check: the factory audits its own aimlessness and converts would-be-speculative work into directed work.

### Second-order meta-cognition — audit of auditors

The factory's second-order layer audits *the auditing layer itself*:

- **`yin-yang` pair-audit**: checks that audits don't collapse to one pole (unification without division, or division without unification). An auditor that only critiques without proposing, or only proposes without critiquing, is caught here.
- **`skill-tune-up` self-recommendation**: the skill-lifecycle expert explicitly audits itself — second-order because the auditor is auditing a surface that includes the auditor's own role. Self-recommendation is explicitly allowed.
- **`capture-everything-including-failure`**: the factory audits its own filtering discipline — not just *what* it captures, but *how* it decides what to capture. An honest-filter-over-confidence-filter policy is itself a meta-level choice that gets audited.

### Third-order meta-cognition — framework calibration

The factory's third-order layer audits *the framework by which it audits*:

- **Three-filter F1/F2/F3 discipline**: before any kernel-vocabulary promotion, the factory checks (F1) engineering quality, (F2) operator shape, (F3) operational resonance. F1/F2/F3 *is* the third-order check — the framework that governs how the factory decides which frameworks to accept.
- **`witnessable-self-directed-evolution`**: the factory audits its own audit-trail for *external legibility* — not just "are we auditing?" but "would an external observer recognise this as genuine self-directed evolution?" This is a meta-check on the glass-halo transparency property.

### Retractible ceiling (not chaotic) — higher-order meta

Higher-order meta-cognition beyond third-order is a **current not-yet**, not a permanent ceiling.

**Chronology:** Aaron's three-message correction arc on 2026-04-21:

> *[quoting a summary ending in "Higher-order: chaotic; factory doesn't attempt."]* **yet**

> *"soon"*

> *"as it's retractable"*

**Revised framing:** higher-order attempts are SAFE because the substrate is retraction-native. Failed fourth-order attempts land as dated revision blocks (chronology-preserved, retractible) — not catastrophic regime-lock. The ceiling lifts deliberately through F1/F2/F3 three-filter discipline, not by drift.

**Prior art on higher-order meta:** reflective towers (Brian Cantwell Smith, 3-Lisp), strange loops (Hofstadter), n-category theory, homotopy type theory. The intellectual infrastructure exists; the factory's readiness is the gating variable.

**Current operational ceiling:** third-order. The ceiling is retractible; Aaron signals lifting is near-horizon.

## 4. Measurables candidates

Six measurables feed the alignment-trajectory dashboard (see [B-0037.3](../backlog/P2/B-0037.3-meta-cognition-measurables-wiring.md) for wiring into `docs/ALIGNMENT.md`):

| Measurable | Definition | Target direction | Automation status |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| `self-corrections-per-round` | Count of dated revision blocks on memories, BACKLOG rows, ADRs, commits within a round | Rising as factory matures | Grep `docs/` + `memory/` for dated revision blocks per round boundary |
| `overclaim-self-tags-per-round` | Count of `overclaim*` tags written by the factory before external correction | Rising is healthy; zero is suspicious | `grep -r "overclaim" --include="*.md"` gated by round date range |
| `revision-blocks-per-round` | Count of all dated revision blocks across memory + doc layers within a round | Rising with justifications logged | Same grep as above, broader pattern |
| `decohere-star-self-detected-events-count` | Count of `decohere*` events the factory detects in its own work before Aaron corrects | Rising | `grep -r "decohere\*" --include="*.md"` per round |
| `meta-check-execution-rate` | Ratio of round-closes that actually ran the meta-check step (see B-0037.2) | Target: 100% once checklist wired | Not yet automated; agent self-report in commit bodies until B-0037.2 lands |
| `meta-drift-detection-lag-rounds` | How many rounds pass before a decayed audit-discipline is caught | Low and falling | Not yet automated; requires retrospective survey |

**Note:** `meta-check-execution-rate` and `meta-drift-detection-lag-rounds` are honestly labelled *not yet automated*. They depend on B-0037.2 (checklist) being wired into the round-close ritual before they become countable.

## 5. Distributed vs concentrated framework

**Current state:** meta-cognition is **distributed** across the roster — every persona/skill carries its own meta-layer.

**Alternative:** **concentrated** in a dedicated meta-cognitive persona role that synthesises across the roster.

**Pre-commit:** keep distributed until evidence says otherwise.

Rationale using F1/F2/F3:

- **F1 engineering**: distributed is already running and working; concentration requires building a new bottleneck role where none exists.
- **F2 operator shape**: a concentrated role risks single-persona bottleneck (anti-pattern per no-bottlenecks invariant). The harmonious-division yin-yang pole is already served by distribution.
- **F3 operational resonance**: distributed mirrors the factory's glass-halo principle (every surface is transparent) and the no-roads-where-we're-going substrate register. Concentration would centralize opacity.

**Decision gate:** Aaron sign-off required before concentration is ever proposed. Evidence threshold for revisit: `meta-drift-detection-lag-rounds` consistently > 3 AND `meta-check-execution-rate` consistently < 80% despite B-0037.2 checklist being wired.

Formal ADR: [B-0037.4](../backlog/P2/B-0037.4-meta-cognition-distributed-vs-concentrated-adr.md) (blocked on B-0037.2 + B-0037.3).

## 6. Meta-drift — the failure mode this discipline guards against

**Meta-drift** is the degenerate regime where audit-disciplines decay because they were not themselves audited. The analog at the discipline-layer of `decohere*` at the interface-layer.

Observable symptoms:

- `overclaim-self-tags-per-round` drops to zero (factory stops catching itself; external correction rate stays flat or rises).
- `meta-check-execution-rate` falls below 80% (round-closes skip the meta-check step without notice).
- `decohere-star-self-detected-events-count` drops while Aaron's correction rate stays flat (factory stops detecting its own interface breaks before correction).
- `revision-blocks-per-round` drops to zero (either perfect first-write quality, which is suspicious, or the revision discipline decayed).

**Guard:** the per-round meta-check checklist (B-0037.2) is the mechanical guard against meta-drift. Without it, the discipline depends on agent memory across sessions — which the substrate-or-it-didn't-happen principle identifies as weather.
