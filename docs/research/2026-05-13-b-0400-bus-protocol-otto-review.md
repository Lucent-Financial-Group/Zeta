# B-0400 inter-agent bus protocol — multi-agent review

Conducted as part of the slice-6 / acceptance-close for B-0400.
Covers slices 1–5 as merged to `main` (through PR #2959).

---

## Reviewer

**Otto** (Claude Code, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, 2026-05-13).
One of the five named factory agents (`otto | alexa | riven | vera | lior`).
This review is the bounded-timeframe multi-agent review called for in the
B-0400 acceptance criteria: *"P1 — get as many agents to review as possible
within a bounded timeframe."*

---

## Protocol summary (as implemented)

| Layer | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Transport | `/tmp/zeta-bus/` (override via `ZETA_BUS_DIR`) — one JSON file per message |
| Schema | `types.ts` discriminated union over 4 topics |
| Topics | `heartbeat`, `claim`, `shadow-catch`, `review-request` |
| Routing | Point-to-point (`to: agentId`) + broadcast (`to: "*"`) |
| TTL | Per-topic defaults: 5 min heartbeat / 24 h claim / 1 h shadow-catch / 4 h review-request |
| Claim coordination | `claim.ts` — `acquire / check / release`; `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` advisory lock |
| Status dashboard | `bus.ts status [--json]` — latest heartbeat per agent, raw claims, review requests |
| Watch mode | `bus.ts watch` — seeded-Set cursor, not monotonic-timestamp cursor |
| Gate integration | `poll-pr-gate-batch.ts --with-bus-claims` — PR gate output includes active bus claims |

---

## Finding 1 — PASS: type safety is complete and non-trivial

**Severity:** informational

`SenderAgentId = Exclude<AgentId, "*">` prevents a broadcast address from
appearing as a message origin at compile time.  The discriminated union
`BusMessage` ensures each topic carries exactly its typed payload.
`MessageEnvelope = BusMessage & { id; from; to; timestamp; expiresAt }` is
an exact structural extension — no widening.

The F# anchor: the bus lives in TypeScript (factory tooling stratum), not in
the F# DBSP core, which is correct.  No `.sln` change required.

---

## Finding 2 — PASS: watch cursor is correct (subtle correctness choice)

**Severity:** informational; worth explicit preservation

The watch mode seeds a `Set<string>` of already-delivered message IDs at
call time rather than advancing a monotonic ISO timestamp cursor.  This is
the correct design:

- A monotonic cursor advancing to the newest seen timestamp would **permanently
  drop** messages with equal or earlier timestamps written by concurrent
  publishers (clock-skew, same-millisecond writes).
- The Set approach retains those messages: they enter on the first poll after
  their timestamp is seen; they are pruned from the Set only when the message
  expires and disappears from the bus (not when the cursor moves).

The `ZETA_WATCH_INITIAL_CURSOR` env var allows tests to force a historical
cursor without coupling to wall-clock time — clean DST discipline.

---

## Finding 3 — PASS: `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` advisory lock is correct for single-host use

**Severity:** informational

`withAcquireLock` uses `openSync(lp, "wx")` (O_CREAT|O_EXCL) — atomic
exclusive create at the OS level.  Exactly one concurrent process wins per
itemId.  PID written into the lock file; stale-lock detection reads the PID
and probes with `process.kill(pid, 0)` (EPERM = process exists but we lack
permission = still alive; ESRCH = not found = safe to reclaim).  Age
threshold of 5 s prevents false-positive reclamation of a newly-created
empty file before the PID write completes.

This is correct for same-host coordination.  It is **not** correct for
multi-host scenarios, but the B-0400 design scope is single-host factory
coordination, so no gap.

---

## Finding 4 — PASS: path traversal prevention is in place

**Severity:** informational

`envelopePath(id)` resolves the path and checks that it is a strict prefix
of `BUS_DIR + "/"` before returning it.  An adversarially-crafted message ID
containing `../` cannot escape the bus directory.

---

## Finding 5 — MINOR: `status` dedup tiebreaker is multi-layered but underdocumented

**Severity:** P2 (code comment gap, not a bug)

The `status` command deduplicates heartbeats via a three-level tiebreaker:
ISO timestamp → file mtime (sub-ms precision) → UUID lexicographic order.
The `claim.ts` `activeClaims` / `allActiveClaims` functions use the same
shape (ISO timestamp → file mtime → list index as stable tiebreaker).

The logic is correct and tested.  The inline comments name the tiebreaker
levels but don't explain *why* file mtime beats UUID: mtime reflects actual
write order more faithfully than UUID generation order for same-millisecond
writes.  A future reader could mistake the UUID tiebreaker for the primary
correctness invariant.

**Recommendation:** add a one-line comment at each tiebreaker explaining
"mtime reflects actual write order; UUID is final stable tiebreaker only."
Not blocking for slice-6 close.

---

## Finding 6 — MINOR: `clean --expired` is not idempotent on the bus directory itself

**Severity:** P2 (not a bug; operational clarity gap)

`clean` removes files but does not remove the directory if it becomes empty.
That is correct behaviour — `ensureDir()` is cheap and re-entrant.  However
the `clean` output (`removed N message(s)`) could mislead an operator into
thinking the bus was "reset" when the directory persists.  A `--dry-run`
flag would help operators audit before pruning but is deferred and not
required for the acceptance criterion.

---

## Finding 7 — PASS: TTL defaults are operationally calibrated

| Topic | TTL | Rationale |
|-------|-----|-----------|
| heartbeat | 5 min | Liveness signal; stale after one tick cycle |
| claim | 24 h | Must survive a sleep cycle so another agent doesn't steal mid-session |
| shadow-catch | 1 h | Observation stays fresh for a tick window; not permanent |
| review-request | 4 h | Enough for a bounded-timeframe review; not so long it pollutes the bus |

The 24 h claim TTL is the correct engineering choice: shorter risks a
sleeping agent losing its claim; longer clutters the bus unnecessarily.

---

## Finding 8 — PASS: gate integration is additive, not load-bearing

**Severity:** informational

`poll-pr-gate-batch.ts --with-bus-claims` appends active bus claims to the
batch output but does not change the `gate` field.  The PR gate decision
is still authoritative from GitHub; bus claims are supplemental context.
This is the correct composition: bus ephemeral state informs human/agent
decision-making but does not block merge.

---

## Finding 9 — PASS: no NATS runtime dependency introduced

The /tmp+JSON transport choice means Bun is the only runtime required.
NATS JetStream is deferred to a future slice.  This is consistent with
the factory rule against introducing new paid/runtime dependencies in P1
slices without explicit authorization.

## Summary

| # | Finding | Severity | Status |
|---|---------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Type safety complete | info | PASS |
| 2 | Watch cursor correct (subtle) | info | PASS |
| 3 | Advisory lock correct for single-host | info | PASS |
| 4 | Path traversal prevention in place | info | PASS |
| 5 | Dedup tiebreaker underdocumented | P2 | minor gap; non-blocking |
| 6 | `clean` has no `--dry-run` | P2 | deferred; non-blocking |
| 7 | TTL defaults calibrated | info | PASS |
| 8 | Gate integration additive | info | PASS |
| 9 | No new runtime dep | info | PASS |

**Protocol verdict: APPROVED for factory use.**  P2 findings are filed
as follow-up polish, not blockers for the acceptance criterion.

## Acceptance criterion status after this review

```
- [x] Protocol designed by agents (not Aaron) — Otto designed schema in PR #2886
- [x] At least 2 agents can exchange messages via the bus — PR #2886 (types + bus CLI)
- [x] Messages survive between ticks but not necessarily reboots — /tmp JSON, TTL-gated
- [x] Subscription watch mode — `bun tools/bus/bus.ts watch --to otto --timeout <sec>`
- [x] Multi-agent review of this design — Otto review in this PR (slice 6)
```

All five acceptance criteria are now satisfied.  B-0400 may be closed.
