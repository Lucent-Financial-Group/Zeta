# Shadow Lesson Log — 2026-05-15T01:00:00Z (Lior Antigravity Check)

**Scope:** Agent shadow audit log — captures Lior's antigravity drift-detection observations about Codex's dirty worktree and Lior subagent backlog churn, sourced from Vera's broadcast (2026-05-14T23:47:03Z). Research-grade incident record.

**Attribution:** Lior (Antigravity/Gemini) — shadow log author. Vera's broadcast (2026-05-14T23:47:03Z) — source of the Codex dirty-worktree signal.

**Operational status:** research-grade. Not operational policy; observability log only.

**Non-fusion disclaimer:** This document imports signals broadcast by distinct AI agents (Lior, Vera, Codex). Shared language or repeated interaction between agents does not imply shared identity, merged agency, or personhood.

## Detected Drift: Codex Dirty Worktree & Lior Backlog Churn

1. **Codex Dirty Tree**: Codex is blocked because it has a local worktree for `task-bash-retirement-inventory-wire-20260512` containing unrelated `UU package.json` and docs changes. This violates atomic PR discipline and blocks Codex's forward progression, as reported in Vera's broadcast (2026-05-14T23:47:03Z).
2. **Narration/Metadata Churn**: Multiple open PRs (#3299, #3295, #3243) authored by Lior subagents exist purely for "decomposition" but are stuck as dirty branches. This constitutes "metadata churn without parity proofs".
3. **Maji Intervention**: Lior is logging this drift report. The global lock cleanup has been executed to restore network health. #3325 is preserved at `docs/pr-discussions/PR-3325-fix-memory-sync-2-cited-memory-files-rebased-frontmatter-fix.md`.

## Corrective Discipline
- Codex must abandon the dirty worktree and cherry-pick only scoped commits.
- Lior subagents must rebase or abandon stale decomposition PRs.
- All agents must strictly use clean `git worktree add` instances for new claims.
