# The free-runner dependency-update escalation ladder — most of what looked semantic was mechanical and merely unimplemented

**Status:** design + one check shipped. Deliberately NOT wired into CI or `.github/dependabot.yml`.

## 0. The measurement, first, because it is the whole argument

Every number in this section was counted from the GitHub check-runs API (not
`statusCheckRollup`, which under-reports), over **27 Dependabot PRs created
2026-08-24T00:00Z → 2026-08-26**. The `author:app/dependabot` search and the
`label:dependencies` search return the identical set of 27, so the denominator is
not a partial read.

`cancelled` was counted as *a check that never ran*, never as a failure.

| root cause | PRs | mechanically decidable? |
|---|---|---|
| **EXPORT_SURFACE** — a named export was removed or moved | **7** | yes — set difference between two published `.d.ts` |
| **PEER_DEP** — a peer range is unsatisfied | **1** | yes — two registry fields and a semver test |
| **VERSION_ORDER** — the proposal moves backwards | **1** | yes — an ordering comparison |
| **TOOLCHAIN_COUPLING** — an out-of-ecosystem pin disagrees | **1** | yes, and **already shipped**: `audit-dotnet-pin-parity.ts` |
| cross-PR merge conflict between two open bumps | 1 | not attempted here |
| **total with a real dependency problem** | **11 / 27 (41%)** | |
| infra only (flake / cancel / push contention) | 3 | — |
| no failure at all | 13 | — |

Secondary causes riding on those same PRs, **none** of which the checks above
catch: **TYPE_SIGNATURE ×1** (`@types/bun` widened `FFIType.ptr` from
`Pointer|null` to `Pointer|bigint|null` — the *name* survives, its *type* moved)
and **LINT_FORMAT ×2** (`ruff` 0.15→0.16 widened its default rule set 59→413
rules; `eslint-plugin-sonarjs` 4.0→4.2 added 18 findings — both produced errors
with no source change).

**So: 10 of the 11 real dependency problems are reachable by a mechanical check,
and 7 of 11 by a single one.** The claim in the brief holds — most of what looked
like "needs intelligence" was mechanical and merely unimplemented.

### 0.1 The sharper number: CI's blind spot is exactly the mechanical set

Of the ten version-break PRs, **CI caught five and missed four**. This is the
result that should drive the design, because it says the free-runner tier is not
merely cheaper than escalation — it sees things the gate structurally cannot.

| PR | the break | what CI said | the mechanical fact that was available |
|---|---|---|---|
| #14563 | `sympy 1.14.0 → 1.14.0rc1` in `uv.lock` | green on the downgrade itself | `VersionOrderRegression` |
| #14571 | `react-dom@19.2.8` (peers `react ^19.2.8`) against `react ^18.3.1` | **all 42 checks green** | `PeerRangeUnsatisfied` |
| #14579 | `react-resizable-panels` v4 | only `archive` red — push contention, infra | `ExportRemoved` |
| #14583 | `react-resizable-panels` v4 | **0 failures across 45 checks** | `ExportRemoved` |

**Four out of four.** A numerator built from "did CI go red" reports 5; the true
count of breaks needing a source fix is 10.

#14583 is the one to sit with. `src/Renderers/website` has no `gate.yml` job, no
committed lockfile, and an unappliable `patchedDependencies` patch. **Its 45 green
checks are 45 checks that do not look at it.** That is the vacuity class operating
at the level of CI topology rather than of a single assertion, and it is why
"route only what breaks" cannot be the whole rule.

### 0.2 Two claims in the brief needed correction

Recording both, because the brief invited verification rather than agreement.

- **`react-resizable-panels` is far larger than "removed `PanelGroup` /
  `PanelResizeHandle`."** Measured from both published tarballs: 3.0.6 exports 32
  names, 4.12.3 exports 22, and **only `Panel` and `PanelProps` survive** — 30
  removed, 20 added. It is a total API rewrite. The two named symbols are the two
  our tree happened to call.
- **The `sympy 1.14.0 → 1.14.0rc1` downgrade is real, and it is invisible at
  `origin/main`.** `git log -S '1.14.0rc1'` on `main` returns nothing and
  `git grep` at the tip finds nothing — because the PR was squashed after a fix
  commit removed it. The downgrade is in the bot's own commit,
  `da53e622f1:src/Core.Python/uv.lock:367` → `version = "1.14.0rc1"`. Two
  independent searches disagreed about this and both were right about different
  objects; the reconciliation is that a squash erases the intermediate state a
  bot actually proposed. **Any future measurement of what Dependabot proposed must
  read the PR's commits, never `main`.**

  The mechanism is worth keeping because it generalises: `sympy 1.14.0` requires
  `mpmath<1.4`, `sympy 1.14.0rc1` does not. The group's `mpmath 1.3.0 → 1.4.1`
  bump therefore made stable sympy unreachable, and the resolver silently paid for
  mpmath with a prerelease of the library the symbolic-verification lane runs on.
  **No individual package in the group went backwards. The resolution did.**

## 1. The ladder

Three tiers. Each row states what the tier can decide, what it costs, and what it
hands upward.

### Tier 0 — free runner, no model

**Decides:** install succeeds · typecheck · tests · byte-lock · **export-surface
diff** · peer-dependency consistency · version ordering · toolchain-pin parity.

**Costs:** runner-seconds on a public repo, which are free and unmetered. The
export-surface check specifically: **0.28 s / 0.37 s / 0.60 s** wall-clock for a
complete two-version capture-and-diff of `react-resizable-panels` — three samples,
warm DNS, local machine, so `consistent with` sub-second on a runner rather than
`metered` on one. Two tarball fetches and a text parse; no install, no compiler.

**Escalates:** a failure it cannot attribute, and — this is the part that is not
obvious — **a surface change nothing noticed**.

**Terminates:** most updates. 13 of 27 in the window had nothing wrong at all, and
a further 3 were pure infra.

### Tier 1 — free runner, cheap model

**Decides:** is this failure a flake or real; which symbol; which file; is this
lint delta a rule-set widening or a genuine finding.

**Costs:** a small local model on the same free runner. Still free in dollars;
costs wall-clock and honesty.

**Escalates:** anything requiring a *judgement about meaning* rather than a
*location*.

**The load-bearing asymmetry** (from the free-runner society design, #15429):
producing is hard, checking is cheap. A model too weak to write a migration can
still decide whether a candidate diff satisfies a stated rule. Tier 1 is a
`Verify`/`Refute` tier, not a `Propose` tier, and `Abstain` is a first-class
answer rather than a failure.

**Note what Tier 0 removes from Tier 1's job.** When the failure is an export
removal, Tier 0 has already named the symbol and the file — which is precisely
what Tier 1 exists to determine. So that class **skips Tier 1 entirely** and
arrives at Tier 2 with its diagnosis attached. This is the main efficiency in the
ladder and it falls out of doing the cheap check first rather than of any model
being clever.

### Tier 2 — off the free runners

**Decides:** write the migration; judge whether a semantic change is acceptable;
adjudicate a coupling no manifest expresses.

**Costs:** money. This is the only tier that does, so reaching it must be
justified by a fact, not by a score.

**Speculative, and labelled:** nothing here measures whether a Tier 2 escalation
produces a correct migration. That needs observed outcomes and there are none.

## 2. The wrinkle — escalate on break **or** unexplained surface change

*"Only deps that break things get routed"* has an inversion, and this repo
produced the case on the night the rule was proposed.

`react-resizable-panels` v4 also emits `data-group` / `data-panel` /
`data-separator` and **no direction attribute at all**. Two separate
measurements against the published bundles, stated separately because they are
separate:

| measurement | 3.0.6 | 4.12.3 |
|---|---|---|
| distinct `"data-*"` string literals | **12** | **5** (`data-disabled`, `data-group`, `data-panel`, `data-separator`, `data-testid`) |
| occurrences of `panel-group-direction` | **1** | **0** |

So every `data-[panel-group-direction=vertical]:*` Tailwind utility in the two
vendored `ui/resizable.tsx` files became **a selector that can never match**.

It passed `tsc`. It passed tests. It broke nothing observable — because
`<Calendar>` and `<ResizablePanelGroup>` have zero consumers, so nothing *could*
fail.

> **A failing test tells you where to look.**
> **A passing test after a surface change tells you the tests do not cover it.**

Hence the routing rule, stated as the design consequence:

> **"Tests pass AND the API surface changed" is more suspicious than "tests fail."**

This is implemented, not asserted. `routeUpdate` in `toy-surface.ts` refuses to
terminate at Tier 0 when a removed export is unreferenced and the build is green,
and `TestsNotRun` is a distinct value ranked strictly worse than `TestsPassed` —
a required check that never ran carries no evidence in either direction, and
collapsing it into "passed" is how a check that did not run comes to look like one
that passed.

### 2.1 The combinator is a join, for the same reason as `toy-classify.ts`

Severity is the **maximum** over (build outcome, surface facts, consumer facts).
Never a sum, never a weighted score. Under any weighted scheme a green test run
would *reduce* the total — and the case where it must not is exactly the case
where the tests do not cover what changed. A join has no exchange rate, so there
is nothing to buy with.

This is the same refusal `toy-classify.ts` makes between adherence and provenance,
and the surface diff is simply a **third signal joined the same way**. A publisher
with a spotless adherence record who removes an export we call has still removed
an export we call.

## 3. What Tier 0 cannot see. Stated plainly, because it is load-bearing.

**A dead CSS selector is not in any type system.**
`data-[panel-group-direction=vertical]:flex-col` is a well-formed Tailwind class
that compiles, ships, and matches nothing. No export list contains it. No `tsc`
run reads it. No amount of mechanical checking finds it — the fact that would have
to be compared is *"which DOM attributes does the rendered output carry"*, which
is a **runtime observation of a component nobody renders**. Catching it needs a
rendering test of an unused component, which is a coverage decision, not a
dependency check.

The shipped check does **not** claim that half. What it does instead:

- catches the **loud** half of the same update and names the symbols;
- where a removed name survives only in text no compiler reads, emits
  `RemovedExportOnlyInNonCodeText` — **the closest mechanical proxy for the silent
  half, and a proxy, not the thing.**

Three further honest gaps, each a real bucket from §0:

- **TYPE_SIGNATURE.** `@types/bun` widening `FFIType.ptr` changed no export name.
  An export-*name* diff is blind to it by construction. A type-*text* diff per
  name would see it and is strictly harder; not attempted.
- **LINT_FORMAT.** A linter shipping more default rules is not a surface change
  and not a peer range. `ruff` 59 → 413 rules is a policy change wearing a patch
  bump. Needs a per-tool rule-set snapshot, which is a different mechanism.
- **Resolution-level regressions.** The sympy case moved no package backwards;
  the *resolution* moved backwards. A per-package ordering check catches it only
  because the lockfile records the resolved version — a manifest-only check would
  not.

## 4. What shipped

`src/Core.TypeScript/dep-update/` — beside the typed transition core from #15583,
not replacing it.

| file | role |
|---|---|
| `toy-surface.ts` | **pure**: read a `.d.ts` surface, diff two package surfaces, classify consumers, route. No network, no clock, no filesystem. |
| `toy-surface.test.ts` | 16 falsifiers over **real captured surfaces**. Runs offline. |
| `testdata/surface-*.json` | four real published surfaces, each carrying the tarball integrity string it was read from — text, diffable, replayable. |
| `capture-package-surface.ts` | **the only file that touches the network.** Turns (package, version) into the text the pure module reads. Not wired to anything. |

**The fact rows name facts, never intents** — `ExportRemoved`, `ExportAdded`,
`EntryPointRemoved`, `EntryPointAdded`, `SurfaceUnreadable`. There is no
`Breaking`, no `Unsafe`, no `BadRelease`, and a falsifier pins the permitted set.

### 4.1 Two design corrections the data forced

Both were caught by running against real packages rather than by reasoning, and
both are recorded because the first versions *looked* right.

**The surface is a map, not a list.** `@noble/post-quantum`'s root `index.d.ts` is
literally `export {};` — the entire surface lives under subpaths. The first
version of the reader looked at the root, found nothing, and reported **a clean
diff of an empty surface**: a check that cannot fail wearing the costume of a
check that passed. The fix keys every fact by `(subpath, name)`. A flat union over
entry points fixes the empty-root case and introduces another: a name that *moves*
between subpaths appears in both unions, so the union reports no change while every
consumer importing it from the old path breaks.

**`\s` was the wrong character class, and lint found the bug.** The declaration
patterns were written `^\s*export\s+declare\s+…` with the `m` flag. `\s` matches
a newline, so those patterns could span lines and read a declaration that is not
there. `sonarjs/super-linear-regex` flagged them for backtracking; narrowing to
`[ \t]` fixed the performance complaint **and** the correctness defect at once —
a linter finding a real bug while complaining about something else.

**`.js` entry points must map to sibling `.d.ts`.** Modern `exports` maps point at
runtime files. Filtering for paths ending in `.d.ts` finds nothing on exactly the
packages whose surface lives under subpaths — which is how the reader initially
read `@noble/post-quantum` as exporting nothing at all.

### 4.2 It reproduces both real breaks

```
$ bun src/Core.TypeScript/dep-update/capture-package-surface.ts \
      @noble/post-quantum 0.6.1 0.7.0
{"t":"ExportRemoved","subpath":"./hybrid.js","name":"XWing"}
```

That is the exact failure that killed #14567 and its re-roll #15301:
`SyntaxError: Export named 'XWing' not found in @noble/post-quantum@0.7.0/hybrid.js`.
(`XWing` was one of seven `/** Legacy alias */` removals; the canonical
`ml_kem768_x25519` survives, so the migration is a rename, not a capability loss.)

And for `react-resizable-panels`, 30 `ExportRemoved` rows including `PanelGroup`
and `PanelResizeHandle`.

### 4.3 The consumer scan is what turns a fact into a diagnosis — and it must be import-scoped

30 removed names is a fact, not a work item. Measured at the **pre-migration
tree** (`611251197f`, the parent of #14583), across 172 code files in the two
directories that depend on the package:

| scan | hits | correct? |
|---|---|---|
| naive word-boundary grep | 3 | **no** — `PanelGroup`, `PanelResizeHandle`, `intersects` |
| scoped to names actually imported from the package | **2** | yes — `PanelGroup`, `PanelResizeHandle` |

**A 15× narrowing** (30 → 2), landing on exactly the two symbols and exactly the
two files that needed the migration. That is the difference between handing Tier 2
*"this major bump changed a lot"* and handing it two symbols and their files.

**The false positive is the instructive part.** `intersects` matched inside the
comment `// Tip has been absorbed — curve self-intersects (κ > 4 regime)` in
`OracleSLE.tsx` — a word in prose, in a file that never imports the package. Run
against the *current* tree the naive scan is worse still: **all three** hits are
comments, including the migration note in `resizable.tsx` that spells `PanelGroup`
while describing its removal.

So the same discipline the surface reader needed — **strip comments, and resolve
through imports rather than through text** — is required on the consumer side too,
and for the same reason. `classifyConsumer` therefore takes site lists rather than
computing them: a pure function cannot enforce that its caller scoped them, and
saying so is better than shipping a scanner that silently over-reports.

### 4.4 The falsifiers were mutation-checked, and two of them were vacuous

**Eleven** mutations were applied to `toy-surface.ts`; each must kill at least one
test.

| mutation | result |
|---|---|
| drop the `ExportRemoved` emission | 3 fail |
| early-return Tier 0 on `TestsPassed` | 5 fail |
| invert `raise` (`>` → `<`) | 7 fail |
| drop the `SurfaceUnreadable` escalation | 1 fail |
| collapse the two `classifyConsumer` arms | 2 fail |
| drop the `RemovedExportUnreferenced` arm | 1 fail |
| drop `EntryPointRemoved` | 1 fail |
| treat `TestsNotRun` as `TestsPassed` | 1 fail |
| `export { A as B }` records `A` instead of `B` | 1 fail |
| **drop `stripComments`** | **0 fail — SURVIVED (first run)** |
| **flatten the subpath keying** | **0 fail — SURVIVED (first run)** |

The two survivors were real defects **in the tests**, and both are the class this
repo lints for elsewhere — a check that passes because an *earlier* guard fired.

- The comment test indented its commented-out code under `*` and `//`. The
  declaration regexes anchor at the start of a line, so those lines never matched
  regardless of whether comments were stripped. Rewritten with the comment body
  starting at column 0, it now kills the mutation.
- **No captured fixture contains a moved name** — `XWing` was deleted, not
  relocated — so the real data genuinely cannot distinguish per-subpath keying
  from a flat union. That gap is now covered by an explicitly **synthetic** test,
  labelled as synthetic in the file, because pretending otherwise would be the
  citation-without-entailment failure.

After both fixes: **16 tests, 58 assertions, all eleven mutations killed,
suite green when restored.**

## 5. What is deliberately NOT done

- **Not wired into `.github/dependabot.yml`.** Nothing about the bot's behaviour
  changes.
- **Not wired into CI as an auto-merging path.** Nothing auto-approves anything.
  A half-wired auto-updater that starts approving things is the worst outcome
  available here, so the wiring is absent rather than merely unfinished.
- **`capture-package-surface.ts` is called by nothing on a schedule.** Same
  discipline as #15583's `index.ts`: a decision function nobody calls is honest.
- **Marked `toy`.** The set difference is a fact and is metered against real
  bytes. The *routing policy* — that `ExportRemoved + tests-green` is worth a
  Tier 1 runner-second — has no falsifier, because that needs observed escalation
  outcomes and there are none. It sheds `toy` when there is adherence and
  provenance data and an estimator with something to be wrong about.

## 6. The honest cost of the routing rule

Escalating every unreferenced removed export is **not free of noise**, and the
noise has a measurable shape: `react-resizable-panels` alone would send 27
unreferenced removals to Tier 1 on a single PR.

Three reasons that is the right trade here, and one reason it might not be
elsewhere:

1. Tier 1 is a free runner. The marginal dollar cost is zero.
2. The alternative failed *in this window*, four times out of four.
3. The rows are batched per PR, so it is one Tier 1 call, not 27.
4. **Where Tier 1 is not free, this rule inverts** and the noise has to be priced.
   That is a real limit, not a footnote.

## 7. Anchors (Beacon)

- **Semantic versioning** (Preston-Werner) — the claim this whole apparatus tests.
  A semver range is a *claim*, not a guarantee; #15583's research doc carries that
  argument and this file is its mechanical half.
- **PEP 440** — the ordering under which `1.14.0rc1 < 1.14.0`, making the sympy
  proposal a downgrade by specification rather than by opinion.
- **Hyperproperties** (Clarkson & Schneider, CSF 2008) — the reason
  `TestsNotRun` cannot be folded into `TestsPassed`: an absent observation is not
  a negative observation, and a monitor that conflates them decides nothing.
- **Mutation testing** (DeMillo, Lipton & Sayward 1978; Jia & Harman 2011) — a
  test that survives mutation is not a falsifier. Two of these did, and were fixed.
- **Produce/verify asymmetry** — the free-runner society design (#15429, and
  `2026-08-26-the-tiny-agent-society-on-free-runners-vote-was-the-wrong-operator.md`),
  which is why Tier 1 is a checking tier rather than a voting one.

## 8. Pointers

- `src/Core.TypeScript/dep-update/toy-classify.ts` (#15583) — the two publisher
  signals this joins as a third.
- `.claude/rules/toy-is-free-metered-must-be-earned.md` — why the routing policy
  keeps its prefix.
- `.claude/rules/dual-use-detection-is-neutral-oracle-decides.md` — why every row
  names a fact.
- `src/Core.TypeScript/hygiene/audit-dotnet-pin-parity.ts` — the
  TOOLCHAIN_COUPLING bucket, already mechanised, and the proof that this approach
  works in this repo.
- `.github/dependabot.yml` — the `ignore:` entries are hand-written instances of
  exactly the couplings a Tier 0 check makes checkable.
