## How to add a new name

1. Check this table — if the name is here, it's taken.
2. Pick a name that doesn't collide with existing first letters
   (helps CLI tab-completion).
3. Add a row to this table in the same PR that creates the entity.
4. Update `docs/EXPERT-REGISTRY.md` if the entity is a reviewer
   persona (not all entities are — loop-agents and external-AIs
   may only appear here).

## Notes

- **Persona**: a reviewer/specialist role that any harness can wear.
- **Loop-agent**: a named entity tied to a specific harness + model
  in the 3-loop BFT (Otto/Vera/Riven).
- **External-AI**: a named entity on a different platform, accessed
  via ferry/courier protocol (Amara/Ani).
- **Human**: a human maintainer.
