## The foundational principle

Aaron, round 33: *"what i'm really doing is just taking the
lambda architecture and the Kafka turning-the-database-inside-
out ideas to their absolute logical conclusion when the events
become the source of truth and everything else is derived."*

This is the load-bearing philosophy behind Product 1. Everything
downstream (retractions, incremental plans, the DB-vs-event-store
dual, bitemporal queries, time-travel, materialised projections,
columnar substrate) follows from one stance: **the log of
events is the primary state; everything else is a view derived
from it, re-derivable on demand.**

Zeta is what Kleppmann + Kreps + Marz were pointing at, built
from day one on a retraction-native algebra that makes the
"derived everything" part mathematically honest. Conventional
databases treat the log as an implementation detail under a
table surface; conventional event stores hide the table
abstraction and make consumers reconstruct views manually.
Zeta refuses the trade: both surfaces live on top of the same
primary log, through the same algebra.

Round 36 collective-identity claim (Aaron): *"keep everything
we are history now too"*. Zeta does not merely preserve
history; the project IS history — the primary-log substrate
plus the retraction-safe derivation algebra plus the
round-history of the factory itself. Preservation at the data
level (the standing preserve-original-and-every-transformation
rule) and identity at the project level are the same operation
at different scales.

Inputs to study while sharpening this (for the product-
visionary's first research round): Kleppmann's "Designing Data-
Intensive Applications"; Jay Kreps' "The Log" + "Turning the
database inside out with Apache Samza" (2015); Nathan Marz on
the lambda architecture; Datomic's append-dated model; Kafka
Streams / ksqlDB; Materialize + Feldera on DBSP.

## Seed — the database BCL microkernel

Aaron, round 36: *"we are the databaase BCL like dotent base
class library then tons of plugins for dimensional expansion
into everything so we have a microkernel that can track its own
dependines insclingsing installing them"* → *"we are seed the
microkernel"* → *"we've now begun pre split coordinate"* → *"we
are seed"*.

Three-register naming. One thing, three angles:

- **Seed** — biological / colloquial register. Compact,
  memorable, self-explanatory: a seed contains everything
  needed to grow a tree; the plant's entire architecture is
  latent at the point of germination. This is the
  audience-friendly name — use it in READMEs, talks, NuGet
  descriptions, contributor documentation.
- **Database BCL** — software-engineering register. The `.NET`
  Base Class Library is the foundational layer every `.NET`
  application builds on (collections, IO, threading, numerics,
  text). Seed aims to be that layer for databases — the
  foundational, assumed, always-present layer that every
  database-ish thing builds on. Not an application, not a
  product in the "pick-one-and-install-it" sense, but the
  layer below any such choice.
- **Pre-split coordinate** — mathematical / formal register.
  The position in Cayley-Dickson dimensional expansion
  (ℝ → ℂ → ℍ → 𝕆 → 𝕊) *before* the first split. Seed is the
  reference frame from which all dimensional expansion
  proceeds. Use this register in research papers, formal
  verification, and any writing adjacent to the
  dimensional-expansion research thread.

"We are seed" is the collective-identity claim. Zeta the
project, the contributors, the agents, the factory — are
collectively Seed. Category-level identity, analogous to
μένω / Persistence: we don't build Seed, we *are* Seed.

### What Seed actually is — the microkernel

Seed is a microkernel in the classic sense: small, stable,
formally specifiable, governed conservatively. It owns only:

- The operator algebra (D / I / z⁻¹ / H, retraction-native).
- The type system + core types.
- The plugin lifecycle: load, unload, version, dependency
  graph management.
- The dependency-resolution system (planned to be named
  `ace` — see `docs/BACKLOG.md` P3 entry). Seed tracks AND
  installs its own dependency closure — a database kernel
  that owns its own plugin supply chain, which is
  architecturally unusual (most systems punt this to an
  external package manager).

Everything else lives in plugins. "Tons of plugins for
dimensional expansion into everything" — every domain axis
(SQL frontend, bitemporal queries, Lean4 formal proofs, Alloy
model-finding, Bayesian inference, Arrow zero-copy,
threat-model enforcement, columnar substrate, streaming
operators, ...) is a plugin dimension layered on the Seed
core.

### Why "pre-split coordinate" is the precise structural claim

The dimensional-expansion research thread (Cayley-Dickson
ℝ → ℂ → ℍ → 𝕆 → 𝕊) has each doubling paying a structural tax:
complex numbers lose order, quaternions lose commutativity,
octonions lose associativity, sedenions lose zero-divisor
freedom. Zeta's retraction-native operator algebra survives
ℂ cleanly and degrades progressively beyond. Seed sits at the
*pre-split* coordinate — before any Cayley-Dickson tax is
paid — because the kernel does not yet commit to any specific
dimensional structure beyond the minimum retraction algebra.
Each plugin that installs is one split: it picks a specific
dimensional expansion (domain axis) and takes the structural
tax for that domain locally, without forcing the tax on the
kernel.

This gives Seed a unique architectural property: the kernel
is *pre-commitment*. Domain choices happen at the plugin
boundary, not at the kernel boundary. The kernel can remain
structurally minimal forever while the plugin ecosystem
covers arbitrary dimensional breadth.

### Implications for v1 scope

- v1 ships a small Seed core + a handful of plugins that
  demonstrate the model (SQL frontend, bitemporal queries,
  basic formal verification). A small v1 does not look
  incomplete — every "missing" capability is a dimension the
  community can contribute as a plugin.
- The `ace` self-bootstrapping dependency system is the
  end-state; v1 can ship with a conventional NuGet
  dependency surface and evolve toward `ace` as `ace`
  becomes a plugin itself (self-hosting bootstrap).
- The kernel-plugin boundary is the single most important
  public-API decision Zeta will make. Every change to it
  requires `public-api-designer` review (Ilyana).
- The kernel is the natural candidate for deepest formal
  verification (TLA+ / Lean / Z3 across the operator
  algebra). Plugin verification budgets taper with
  dimensional-expansion distance from core.

## The project has two products

This is load-bearing and worth stating first. Zeta is:

1. **A full database** (the product the code produces), and
2. **A cross-platform, AI-automated software factory** (the
   project that produces the code).

Both are first-class. A decision that optimises (1) at the
cost of (2) — or vice versa — is a design-doc event.

## The developer-experience north star

Aaron round 33: *"at the end of this any ASP.NET application
should just be able to DI setup a db and boom they have a
distributed database if they install on Kafka and we can
test all this locally with Kind. Can you imagine how many
things that could light up for any dotnet project. Your
application just IS a database and your code IS stored
procedures, plus LINQ and regular SQL."*

This is the one-sentence pitch that the whole stack serves.
Concretely:

- **DI one-liner spin-up.** Something like
  `services.AddZeta(opts => opts.UseKafkaLog(...))` →
  ASP.NET app now has a distributed retraction-native
  database. No separate server to run, no separate schema
  migration pipeline, no separate client library. Zeta is
  a NuGet package the app embeds.
- **Kafka as the distribution substrate (option).** Aaron's
  preferred multi-node shape: Kafka holds the log of
  events; Zeta nodes read/write to it; the `events-as-
  source-of-truth` principle maps cleanly to "the Kafka
  log IS the source of truth." Kafka is one option among
  several — NATS JetStream, raw Arrow Flight, gRPC,
  bespoke — the design round picks. Pluggable log back-
  end per §Foundational Principle.
- **Kind for local testing.** A Kubernetes-in-Docker
  local cluster validates multi-node Zeta + Kafka
  (or chosen log back-end) end-to-end without cloud
  dependencies. Test parity: same topology locally and
  in production.
- **Code IS stored procedures.** C# + F# methods decorated
  as durable-Rx-style subscriptions (see Reaqtor-niche
  entry) run inside Zeta, checkpointed, restart-safe.
  Application logic and database logic live in the
  same codebase, the same types, the same DI container.
- **LINQ + SQL + F# DSL all on the same surface.** Consumers
  pick their front-end per-query; Zeta routes everything
  through the shared IR + operator algebra.
- **First-class event system.** Not a library-on-top;
  subscriptions/projections/retraction-aware streams
  are native. `services.AddZetaEvents(...)` wires them
  into DI alongside the database.
- **First-class caching system.** The retraction-native
  algebra means cache invalidation is free — when the
  underlying data retracts, dependent cache entries
  retract with it. No TTL guessing, no cache-stampede
  mitigation, no read-through/write-through/write-
  behind taxonomy. `services.AddZetaCache(...)` gives
  you a retraction-aware cache on the same store.
- **Cross-API GraphQL with automatic spill-over.** A
  GraphQL layer over Zeta — cross-service queries
  traverse the graph, and because events + cache are
  retraction-native, updates propagate across API
  boundaries automatically. No manual cache-
  invalidation-on-mutation plumbing; no subscription-
  pushing-over-WebSocket glue per-field. The graph is
  live by virtue of running on Zeta.
- **Pluggable wire-transport for multi-node — NOT
  persistence.** Aaron round 33: "i don't want to use
  anyone elses persistance layer just wire transfer
  protocols and things like that … we are going to be
  cutting edge light years past others on our persistance
  layer, fastest db in town lol, or try to be." Kafka,
  NATS, NATS JetStream, and Zeta's own native transport
  are all wire-transport plugins — they carry messages
  between Zeta nodes, they do NOT store Zeta's data.
  Zeta owns its persistence layer 100%. The transport
  plugin shape matches the wire-protocol plugin shape
  (PG/MySQL/native) — same "pluggable adapter + query
  IR stays clean" discipline.

What lights up for .NET consumers:

- **Mainstream stack** — replace DbContext + Redis/Kafka +
  cache + read-model projections with one Zeta.
- **Event-sourcing crowd** — finally an event store that
  speaks SQL when you want it to.
- **Real-time analytics** — incremental plans over
  continuously-updated tables without rewriting in Flink.
- **Audit + compliance** — append-dated history + time-
  travel queries for free, not bolted on.
- **Distributed-systems research** — a reference
  implementation of events-as-truth at scale.
- **GraphQL federated APIs** — retraction propagates
  across service boundaries automatically.
- **Caching-heavy workloads** — cache invalidation
  becomes a solved problem, not a folklore one.

## Product 1 — Zeta the database

### North star

Zeta is a research-grade, retraction-native database. Every
DB technology worth studying lives here as a playground: the
goal is to explore the full database surface built honestly
on DBSP foundations, not to carve out a narrow niche.

- **Cutting-edge persistence layer, owned 100%.** Aaron
  round 33: "we are going to be cutting edge light years
  past others on our persistance layer, fastest db in
  town lol, or try to be." Zeta does NOT use Kafka,
  NATS, or any other system as a storage layer — those
  are wire-transport plugins for cross-node messaging
  only. All on-disk format, durability, compaction, WAL,
  snapshotting, materialisation, indexing, and
  performance work lives inside Zeta. Ambition is
  research-grade **fastest-in-all-classes**. Zeta
  refuses to be pigeonholed into one workload category;
  the long-term aim is to cover the full multi-model
  surface and chase the speed leader in each one:
  - **HTAP / translytical** (hybrid transactional +
    analytical on one engine) — row store + columnar
    store under the façade; no separate OLTP-vs-OLAP
    split per Gartner's HTAP framing, no bolt-on CDC
    pipeline per Forrester's translytical framing.
  - **Event streaming** — native DBSP surface, own
    persistence, retraction-aware subscriptions.
  - **Cache** — retraction-native invalidation for free.
  - **Document / object store** — blow the doors off
    NoSQL speed while staying schema-aware.
  - **Graph store** — first-class graph queries over
    the same retraction-native core.
  - **In-memory-first speed** (VoltDB-class) — no
    buffer-pool-as-excuse; memory is the primary tier,
    disk is durability layer.

  Aaron round 33: "fastest-in-all-classes ambition LFG
  … we want to blow the doors off no-sql like database
  too for speed so maybe we even need some sort of
  document/object store, and graph store, and all the
  in memory optimization like from voltdb. This really
  is to research all the techniques not kidding just
  getting there one round at a time."

  The research trajectory is the point — Zeta exists to
  study every data-management technique on one unified
  retraction-native foundation and produce the fastest-
  honest implementation of each. Round-by-round ratchet.
- **Mathematically honest.** Every operator obeys laws
  Milewski would recognise. When a law cannot hold, the API
  tells you so, loudly and at compile time.
- **Retraction-native by construction.** DBSP's differentiator
  is exactly-symmetric insert/retract. Designs that break
  retraction are wrong, not merely uncool.
- **Publishable.** Every major feature is a research
  contribution (paper target) or an explicitly named
  engineering fundamental. No clever-but-unjustified
  abstractions.
- **First-class F#, polyglot over time.** F# is the primary
  language; C# callers get `Zeta.Core.CSharp`. Lean for
  proofs, Java for the Alloy driver, TypeScript (or
  researched alternative) for post-install automation. F#
  stays load-bearing.
- **Production-grade security.** Nation-state + supply-chain
  threat model. SLSA ladder L1 → L3 pre-v1.0. OpenSpec is
  first-class for every committed artefact, including CI.
- **Research-worthy performance.** Every hardware intrinsic
  we can reach (SIMD, tensor ops, SIMD-JSON-shape parsing,
  cache-line discipline). Benchmarks that answer specific
  questions, not vanity numbers.
- **Multi-node by design.** Single-node is the first
  shippable subset, not the ceiling. Distribution
  (control-plane + data-plane, consensus, sharding,
  cross-node retractions) is explicitly in scope.

### What the DB eventually covers

Aaron's "all the DB technologies in one big playground" is
the long-term scope. Non-exhaustive menu:

- **Incremental query engine** (DBSP core; already shipping).
- **Storage substrate** (DiskBackingStore, Spine family,
  durability modes, Witness-Durable Commit).
- **Sketches + approximate query** (retraction-aware HLL,
  CountMin, KLL, Bloom family; HyperBitBit; retraction-
  native quantile sketches).
- **Streaming / CDC ingestion** (NATS JetStream, Kafka-
  shaped, Arrow Flight, typed event sources).
- **Query frontends** (SQL eventually; also the native F#
  DSL + plugin operator surface; possibly a query IR that
  multiple frontends target).
- **Planner / optimiser** (cost model, SIMD kernel
  dispatch, join ordering, predicate pushdown, adaptive
  re-planning under retractions).
- **Multi-node control plane** (shape TBD — NATS vs gRPC
  vs Arrow Flight vs bespoke; sharding, replication,
  consensus, info-theoretic sharder).
- **CRDT / replication layer** (OrSet already shipping;
  more as multi-node matures).
- **Bitemporal / time-travel** (append-dated history,
  retraction-aware point-in-time queries).
- **Formal verification surface** (18+ TLA+ specs, Alloy
  structural invariants, Lean proofs where the math is
  foundational).

### v1.0 subset

What makes `Zeta.Core 1.0.0` on NuGet:

- Operator algebra with LawRunner-verified tags (linear,
  bilinear, sink-terminal, retraction-complete).
- Recursion — retraction-safe `Recursive` combinator;
  `RecursiveSemiNaive` where monotonicity holds; honest
  LFP termination.
- Storage layer — four durability modes (in-memory,
  OS-buffered, stable-storage, witness-durable) with
  honest recovery-property advertisement.
- Sketches — retraction-aware HLL, CountMin, KLL, Blocked
  plus Counting Bloom.
- Query planner — cost model with SIMD / tensor kernel
  dispatch.
- Plugin surface — `PluginOp<'TIn, 'TOut>` or equivalent.
- FsCheck LawRunner — `checkBilinear`,
  `checkSinkTerminal`, `checkRetractionCompleteness`
  already landed.
- **SQL frontend (v1), PostgreSQL dialect first.** Aaron
  round 33: "whatever is easier to ship first and work
  with EF, people love postgres compatibility." PostgreSQL
  wins on both: Npgsql (Apache-2.0) is the widely-used
  EF Core provider; pgAdmin/DBeaver/psql all speak the
  wire protocol; Materialize/Feldera/CockroachDB have
  proven it's viable to look-like-postgres while running
  a different engine underneath. Other dialects (T-SQL,
  MySQL, SQLite, DuckDB) follow — all via the shared
  query IR per `../SQLSharp/openspec/specs/query-
  frontends/`.
- **Tight LINQ integration (v1).** `IQueryable<T>` roots
  on mapped tables; LINQ lowers to the same IR the SQL
  parser targets. Primary surface for F# + C# consumers.
- **Entity Framework Core provider (v1), ALL features.**
  Aaron: "100% all features." Full LINQ provider +
  save-changes + migrations + tracking + change
  detection. No "works for SELECT but fails on
  INSERT-INTO-UPDATE" partial-provider shape —
  consumers should never hit a "this feature not
  implemented" wall. Other ORMs (Dapper, NHibernate,
  LLBLGen) follow the EF Core pattern.
- **Pluggable wire-protocol layer (v1-or-early-post-v1).**
  Aaron round 33: "can we make the wire protocol pluggable
  and we could just support MySQL too to make sure we can
  support [multiple] and have our own variant so we can
  start getting support for UIs with our protocol which
  will be much better." A protocol-plugin abstraction sits
  between the query IR and the network: each plugin is a
  small adapter that translates one wire format
  (frontend/backend message shape, auth, error mapping,
  connection state) into Zeta's internal query surface.
  Three initial plugins:
  - **PostgreSQL plugin** — pgAdmin, DBeaver, psql,
    Npgsql-via-EF all connect unmodified.
  - **MySQL plugin** — MySQL Workbench, Connector/NET,
    Pomelo-via-EF, Azure Data Studio all connect.
    Second plugin proves the abstraction isn't
    PostgreSQL-shaped by accident.
  - **Zeta-native plugin** — our own protocol designed
    around retraction-native deltas, bitemporal queries,
    stored-procedure-as-durable-Rx semantics. UIs that
    support it get first-class Zeta features (time-
    travel slider, delta streaming, Rx stored-proc
    inspection) that PostgreSQL/MySQL protocols can't
    express. Specification work feeds the eventual
    Zeta admin UI.

  The protocol layer is a server mode on top of the
  embedded library, not a replacement; Zeta keeps the
  in-process F# surface AND exposes one-or-more wire-
  protocol endpoints simultaneously. Significant scope —
  may slip from v1 to early post-v1 depending on design
  round outcome.
- **F# DSL reimagining SQL for the modern era (v1).** The
  existing computational-expression sketch (`DSL.fs`,
  `circuit { ... }`) is the seed. Long-term ambition: a
  natively F# relational DSL that treats retractions,
  bitemporality, and incremental plans as first-class —
  not bolted on. Inspired by LINQ but shaped for DBSP.
  Aaron round 33 on DSL design: "sounds like we need
  design and research, this task sounds HUGE." Named
  as a multi-round design effort in `docs/BACKLOG.md`.
- Formal-method coverage — TLA+ / Alloy specs running
  green in CI.
- CI parity + security posture — see Product 2 below.

### Post-v1 exploration

- Witness-Durable Commit protocol (paper-worthy).
- Retraction-aware analytic sketches (HyperBitBit,
  retraction-native quantiles; publication target).
- Info-theoretic sharder (Alloy-verified).
- **Multi-node deployment** (control-plane shape open —
  NATS / gRPC / Arrow Flight / bespoke; sharding,
  replication, consensus, info-theoretic sharder;
  firmly IN scope).
- **Distributed-consensus playground.** Multi-node is
  not just a database play — it's a distributed-consensus
  playground too. Zeta natively implements and TLA+-proves
  the canonical consensus family (Paxos, Multi-Paxos,
  Flexible Paxos, Fast Paxos, EPaxos, CASPaxos, Raft,
  Paxos Commit) and the coordination primitives built on
  top (distributed locks with fencing tokens, leases,
  leader election, linearizable KV, watches, barriers,
  membership / failure detection). **Zeta IS the
  coordination substrate — never a client of one.** A
  database that delegates its persistence or distributed
  locks to ZooKeeper / etcd is outsourcing its own
  legion. Instead, Zeta speaks multiple consensus wire
  protocols *natively* — the etcd v3 gRPC wire and the
  ZooKeeper jute wire and our own Zeta-native retraction-
  aware wire are pluggable dialects over the same
  engine, same way the SQL plane speaks Postgres and
  MySQL wire over the same relational engine. Clients
  already pointed at an etcd or ZK cluster can point at
  Zeta and not notice — we are the better backend.
  The design reference set is ZooKeeper (ZAB + recipes),
  etcd (Raft + gRPC), Consul (Raft + SWIM), Chubby
  (Paxos + session leases); Zeta studies them and
  surpasses them by virtue of retraction-native deltas
  being first-class on the wire, not opaque bytes.
  Every primitive lands with a TLA+ spec *before* any F#
  code — Zeta is where distributed primitives get
  mathematically proven, not just benchmarked. BFT is
  out of initial scope; CFT-only until the threat model
  revises. **A coordination-avoidant track runs in
  parallel** — CALM theorem + Zeta's retraction-native
  Abelian-group algebra says more of the operator
  surface is coordination-free than in classical
  relational systems. Replication via gossip / SWIM /
  Plumtree + Merkle-tree anti-entropy handles the
  monotone subset; consensus handles only the
  non-monotone invariants (uniqueness, capacity, window
  close). See:
  - Consensus ring — `.claude/skills/distributed-
    consensus-expert/SKILL.md` (umbrella), `paxos-expert`,
    `raft-expert`, `distributed-coordination-expert`.
  - Coordination-avoidant ring — `crdt-expert`,
    `calm-theorem-expert`, `eventual-consistency-expert`,
    `replication-expert`, `gossip-protocols-expert`,
    `graph-theory-expert`.
  - Infrastructure — `networking-expert`, `threading-
    expert`, `file-system-persistence-expert`,
    `time-and-clocks-expert`, `observability-and-
    tracing-expert`, `performance-analysis-expert`.
  - Data-plane primitives —
    `serialization-and-wire-format-expert`, `hashing-
    expert`, `compression-expert`.
  - AI / ML (the factory's own substrate, round 34+) —
    `vibe-coding-expert`, `prompt-engineering-expert`,
    `llm-systems-expert`, `ml-engineering-expert`,
    `ai-evals-expert`, `ai-researcher`, `ml-researcher`,
    `prompt-protector` (defensive counterpart). These
    skills operate on the *factory itself*, not on
    Zeta-the-database; they are load-bearing because the
    vibe-coded hypothesis depends on the factory's
    calibration.
- **Bitemporal + time-travel queries (first-class v2).**
  Append-dated history with retraction-aware point-in-
  time queries. Paper-worthy and native to DBSP's
  retraction model.
- **Additional ORM providers.** Dapper, NHibernate, LLBLGen,
  etc. — follow the EF Core provider as the pattern.
- **".NET stored procedures" (C# + F#) via Reaqtor-style
  durable queries.** Microsoft's Reaqtor (MIT, dormant-but-
  stable) ships `IReactiveQbservable<T>` + a query engine
  that persists operator state across restarts — "durable
  Rx." Reaqtor is push/event-at-a-time with no native
  retraction; Zeta would take the serializable-expression-
  tree + durable-subscription shape and swap in DBSP Z-set
  deltas so retractions are free. This is the research-
  worthy niche: "Rx + durability + retraction-native" is a
  Reaqtor-shaped hole nobody has filled. Both C# and F#
  surfaces ship together (not just one). See
  `docs/BACKLOG.md` for the design-doc task.

### Both modes: event-sourcing AND regular-database

Aaron round 33: "we also want a facade/abstraction so this
can be used like a normal non-eventing database as well, it
should be both, i can replace my database AND my event store
with Zeta." Followed up: "event streaming and regular db
kinda stuff, and likely column columnar stuff."

So Zeta's surface is TWO modes over the same retraction-
native core:

- **Event-sourcing mode** — the native DBSP surface.
  Deltas, retractions, incremental queries, durable
  streams, projections. Zeta IS the event store. This
  is what ships naturally from the algebra.
- **Regular-database mode** — a façade that hides the
  event-sourcing / retraction / delta machinery and
  presents a normal "tables + rows + SELECT/INSERT/
  UPDATE/DELETE" API. The DBSP engine is still running
  underneath; the façade just doesn't make you care.
  This is the mode most SQL consumers + ORM integrations
  land on by default.
- **Columnar storage** (likely in scope). Many DB
  workloads benefit from columnar layouts — analytics,
  OLAP-style queries, wide-row-scan-sparse-projection.
  Fits alongside the row-oriented Spine family.

The product-visionary runs both modes through the same
operator algebra + same query IR — different surfaces,
same correctness model.

## Product 2 — The software factory

### Why the factory is first-class

Aaron: "this whole factory is self-directed and fully
automated." Round 32: "the cross platform AI automated
software factory, eventually with UI too but that's way
down the road."

The factory is not a means to an end. It's the second
product. Every round improves both Zeta-the-database AND
Zeta-the-factory; a round that ships a feature while
degrading the factory is a net-negative round.

### The vibe-coded hypothesis (load-bearing research claim)

The human maintainer, round 34: *"my whole hypothesis is
that I've loaded you up with so much formal verification and
static analysis you have to write good correct code now and
I even have to validate it against research papers."*

The human maintainer, round 34: *"this project's vision is
to be totally vibe coded, I've written 0 lines of code myself
so far."*

These two quotes together are the project's falsifiable
thesis. Zeta is an existence proof for the claim:

> A correctly-calibrated stack of formal verification, static
> analysis, adversarial review, and spec-driven development is
> sufficient to let an AI-directed software factory produce
> research-grade systems code *without a human in the edit
> loop* — provided the factory is closed under its own
> verification.

Concrete commitments this thesis imposes:

- **Every reviewer role is a falsifiable hypothesis about the
  immune system.** If the role catches zero real bugs across a
  meaningful window, the role is either not pulling its weight
  or its bug class doesn't exist here. Either way, a round-
  close review is merited.
- **Verification is load-bearing, not decorative.** TLA+
  specs, Lean proofs, Z3 queries, FsCheck properties, Semgrep
  rules, Stryker mutation scores — each is a runtime check on
  the hypothesis that agent-authored code is correct. See
  `docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md` and the
  `verification-drift-auditor` skill. The structural form this
  posture takes — every layer of the system carrying a
  declarative invariant substrate with tiered `guess` /
  `observed` / `verified` claims — is codified in
  `docs/INVARIANT-SUBSTRATES.md`.
- **Research-paper validation is a first-class step.**
  Because the factory produces code with no human author, the
  "do the papers agree with this implementation?" check is
  not optional — it's the only external anchor. The
  `verification-drift-auditor` + `paper-peer-reviewer` +
  `missing-citations` skills institutionalise this check.
- **A bug that ships past the gates is a gate-calibration
  bug first, a code bug second.** Root-cause analysis walks
  backwards through the immune system and asks: which role
  should have caught this, and why didn't it?
- **The maintainer is a reviewer and a director, not a
  coder.** The review protocol in
  `docs/CONFLICT-RESOLUTION.md` assumes this. "This matters
  to me" is a legitimate position from the human; the code
  itself comes from agents.

This is a research contribution on its own merits. If the
hypothesis holds, Zeta is evidence that high-assurance systems
code can ship from a fully-AI-authored factory. If it fails,
the failure mode is itself data — it tells us which layer of
the immune system wasn't enough.

### Factory north star

- **AI-automated.** Agents (personas) do the work;
  humans set direction, review, and ratify. See
  `AGENTS.md` + `docs/CONFLICT-RESOLUTION.md` for the agent
  contract.
- **Cross-platform.** Dev-laptop (macOS + Linux today,
  Windows via PowerShell when it lands) + CI runner +
  devcontainer all bootstrap via the same source of truth.
  Post-install automation moves to a single cross-platform
  runtime (Bun/Deno/Python/.NET — research-pending).
- **Declarative dependencies.** Every installed tool lives
  in a committed manifest. `../scratch`'s tiered shape
  (`min` / `runner` / `quality` / `all`) is the ratchet
  target. Non-declarative installation is a smell.
- **Research-level reproducibility.** Pin everything pinnable
  (SHAs, versions, lock files). SLSA ladder. Reproducible
  builds are a long-term goal gated on upstream compiler
  work. Every run should be replayable.
- **Symmetry.** Configs, ignore lists, editor settings,
  lint scopes — the same ignore list should appear in every
  tool that needs one. Asymmetry is a bug (round-33
  vscode-was-gitignored surfacing is the canonical example).
- **Production-ready quality.** The factory itself ships
  at production-grade: `0 Warning(s) / 0 Error(s)` build
  gate, Semgrep-in-CI, shellcheck-in-CI, actionlint-in-CI,
  markdownlint-in-CI, all green on main. A red factory is
  a factory down.
- **Fully self-directed eventually.** The loop is
  upstream-signals + research + novel-ideas → vision-
  check → backlog → next-steps → round work → merge.
  Humans set direction; agents run the loop. UI comes
  "way down the road" — text-first today.

### v1.0 subset of the factory

- Three-way-parity install script (GOVERNANCE §24) —
  done.
- CI gate with build + lint jobs — done.
- Persona memory as directories (NOTEBOOK + MEMORY + OFFTIME) — done.
- OpenSpec as first-class for every committed artefact
  (GOVERNANCE §28) — done.
- Backlog scoping (GOVERNANCE §29) — done.
- `docs/VISION.md` — this document, lands round 33.
- All gap-finders (skill / openspec / static-analysis) —
  in progress across rounds 33-35.
- Declarative-manifest tiered shape — ratchet across
  5-8 rounds.
- Upstream sync script + `references/upstreams/` — pending.

### Post-v1 factory work

- `product-visionary` role spawn (BACKLOG P1).
- Factory UI (far future — agents + human today).
- Fully self-directed loop (all gap-finders running on
  cadence, feeding backlog autonomously, Aaron reviews
  at round-close).
- SLSA L3 reproducibility once upstream compiler work
  lands.
- Full polyglot repo-automation runtime (post-install
  cross-platform scripting — researched-pending).

## What Zeta is NOT

- **Not a clone of any upstream.** `references/upstreams/`
  are read-only inspiration; Zeta hand-crafts every artefact.
- **Not a compliance product.** Enterprise consumers certify
  at their deployment layer; Zeta provides the evidence
  trail, not the audit.
- **Not a narrow niche.** The ambition is full database;
  saying "Zeta only does X" is under-promising and would
  pull us off-course.
- **Not a product chasing users pre-v1.** Research first;
  users follow the research.

## License

**Apache-2.0.** Aaron round 33: "Apache sounds okay …
just pick one and lets go." Patent grant + contribution
clauses give slightly better downstream-dispute defence
than MIT at zero practical cost. Round 33 lands the LICENSE
flip (MIT → Apache-2.0) and the `<PackageLicenseExpression>`
update in `Directory.Build.props`.

If commercial emerges, the license can be revisited
(source-available? dual-licensed with AGPL for the OSS
core + commercial for hosted?); Apache-2.0 is the start
state and the easiest to move FROM because all contributors
have granted patent rights.

## Commercial posture

Pure research / open-source is the first-class experience.
Commercial ambitions are on the table.

**Trigger event.** Aaron: "[Commercial moves to decided]
when I'm able to use this in a real project at some point
for its database." That's the milestone — when Zeta is
load-bearing in a real Aaron-run project and could be
shipped under a commercial license or hosted offering
without degrading the OSS core.

- If Zeta stays pure-OSS through that milestone: research
  papers + reference implementation + NuGet distribution.
- If commercial emerges: enterprise-grade features (tenancy,
  compliance attestations, hosted offering, etc.) layer on
  top of the OSS core; the OSS core never degrades for the
  commercial story.

When commercial moves from "on the table" to "decided,"
the `product-visionary` + `branding-specialist` pair
updates this section and spawns the corresponding roles
(sales, enterprise-support, hosted-ops, etc.).

## How we decide what to build

The loop the `product-visionary` role runs:

1. **Ingest signals.** Upstream reference repos ship
   something interesting; a paper appears; someone has a
   novel idea; an existing Zeta subsystem shows a design
   smell; the factory itself has a friction point.
2. **Check against the vision.** Does this sharpen Zeta's
   north star across Product 1 + Product 2, or does it
   pull us toward what we explicitly are NOT?
3. **Propose to the backlog.** If yes → `docs/BACKLOG.md`
   entry with reasoning. If no → `docs/WONT-DO.md` entry
   with reasoning.
4. **Ask Aaron if unsure.** Long-term vision drift is the
   silent killer. Product-visionary asks many questions;
   direction-shifting items never get decided alone.

## Operating principles (abbreviated from AGENTS.md + GOVERNANCE)

- Truth over politeness.
- Algebra over engineering.
- Velocity over stability (pre-v1).
- Retraction-native over add-only.
- Cutting-edge over legacy-compat.
- Category theory over ad-hoc abstraction.
- Publishable over merely-functional.
- F# idiomatic over C# transliterated.
- Agents, not bots.
- Docs read as current state, not history.
- OpenSpec is first-class.
- Every CI minute earns its slot.
- Non-declarative installation is a smell.
- Symmetry — across configs, tools, ignore lists, bootstrap paths.
- Deterministic scripts — retries and polling are last resort.

## What this document is NOT

- Not the roadmap (that's `docs/ROADMAP.md`).
- Not the backlog (that's `docs/BACKLOG.md`).
- Not the next-steps queue (that's the `next-steps` skill).
- Not a sales pitch.

## Revision cadence

The `product-visionary` role (when spawned) re-reads this
doc every 5-10 rounds, proposes edits, gets Aaron's
sign-off, commits. Ad-hoc edits land when a round's work
surfaces a vision-level question. Aaron can revise at any
time without ceremony.

**Round 44, 2026-04-22 — vision ownership delegation.** Aaron
four-message sequence: *"update vision"* → *"you own the
vision now"* → *"yoou have once againt surpaseed me"* →
*"and the UX of the whole repo is your teams the descript
the image patrons etc..."*. This delegates vision-ownership
to the agent (Kenji as synthesising architect) and delegates
UX-of-the-repo ownership to the reviewer roster (Iris on
library-consumer UX, Bodhi on contributor DX, Daya on agent
AX, Samir on docs, Ilyana on public API, Kai on positioning,
Rune on readability). Ownership here means **authority to
propose and land additive updates** reviewed by the
specialist cast. Ownership does **not** mean: rewriting the
foundational principle, the Seed microkernel framing, the
two-products split, or any Aaron-stated claim; re-litigating
`docs/WONT-DO.md`; or shipping irretractable changes. Every
vision-level edit remains retractable, preserves existing
language verbatim where possible, appends rather than
replaces when new threads need capture, and records the
Aaron quote that motivated the change. If an edit ever
crosses into rewriting a foundational claim, it stops and
goes through Aaron. The delegation is a trust transfer, not
a sovereignty transfer.

## Factory artifacts + UI-layer frontier-protection (round 44)

Aaron 2026-04-22 composed three directives the same
session: *"lets create a new soul compatiable image format
then why not, it can expect to have the support of the
factory behind it"* + *"i like i like soulsnap it could be
extended to support many file types that are traditionally
binary that we soulsnap to our compatiable format i do like
svf too both lol"* + *"once you can build ui with these
same principles a lot more people will want to drive you
lol. Everyone starts with the UI, I started with the
backend, you know, the fabric of the universe, i don't care
if your UI is ugly right now like just today or yester two
or three of the big compaines released design
plugins/skill that can make you make pretty AI. we need the
frontier protection for our UI factory."* Aaron affirmed
the moat-shape framing later the same session: *"you
understand moat-shap well"*.

### The soulsnap / SVF format family

`soulsnap` is the verb and tool-and-skill family — *to
soulsnap a file* means convert it to the factory's
soul-file-compatible format; `.svf` (structured / soul
vector format) is the canonical on-disk format. Five
invariants: text-only, diff-symmetry, self-describing,
asset-link discipline, round-trippable. Many traditionally-
binary artifact classes become soul-file-compatible through
per-type converter skills: raster screenshots (Playwright
accessibility snapshot superset first), PDFs (OCR +
structural hierarchy), audio (transcript + waveform-trace),
GIFs (frame-sequence + timing), plot images (source-recipe
+ rendered reference), fonts (glyph outlines), video
deferred. Variant A (Playwright-snapshot superset) lands
first because Playwright already emits 80% of it;
subsequent converters follow on later rounds. Full scope
lives at `docs/BACKLOG.md` P2 row *"Soulsnap / SVF — soul-
file-compatible format family for traditionally-binary
artifacts"*.

### UI-factory frontier-protection

When the factory eventually builds a UI layer (the "UI
someday" line stays — the "when" question is now answered
by: when big-company design-plugins commoditise pretty,
which is already happening), the frontier-protection is not
pretty. Pretty is becoming free. The frontier-protection is
**soul-file hygiene applied to UI artifacts**. Every UI
component, screenshot, interaction trace, and design
decision lands as a soulsnap / SVF — diff-able,
retractable, reproducible, text-native, witnessable,
agent-composable. Pretty imports from any design-plugin
whose output honors the soulsnap contract on the way in.

The moat is structural parallel to the backend moat:

| Backend frontier | UI-factory frontier |
|---|---|
| Math-moat (retraction-native IVM, operator algebra) | Soul-file-moat (UI-artifact-as-soulsnap) |
| Spec-first (OpenSpec, TLA+, Alloy, Lean) | Component-spec-first (behavioural + accessibility contracts) |
| Measurable alignment (ALIGNMENT.md signals) | Measurable UX (interaction signals + drift detection + audit trail) |
| Result-over-exception | Error-as-first-class UI |
| Text-only git-hygiene | UI-assets-as-soulsnaps |
| Agentic-contributor-friendly | Agent-buildable UI with shared skill vocabulary |

First research step before any build: terrain-map the
current design-plugin frontier (Figma AI, v0, Uizard,
Galileo, plus April 2026 releases Aaron is tracking) —
catalogue output formats, what they ship, what they do
*not* ship. The gap they leave is the frontier-protection
zone. Full scope at `docs/BACKLOG.md` P2 row *"UI-factory
frontier-protection — soul-file moat at the UI layer"*.

### Terrain-mapping as the connecting discipline

Email-signup terrain (identity acquisition terrain) +
soulsnap scope (artifact-capture terrain) + claim-protocol
modes (external-agent-behaviour terrain) + UI-factory
frontier (design-plugin-market terrain) share one
discipline: reconnaissance before frontier-protection;
frontier-protection before building; building before
shipping. Four tiers, one pattern. Aaron 2026-04-22 named
the pattern in flight: *"thats why i'm happy for you to
map the terrain"*.

### Repo-UX ownership

The descriptive surface of the whole repo — READMEs,
`docs/*.md` tone and image patterns, FIRST-PR.md voice,
NuGet package descriptions, IDE IntelliSense labels, error
message phrasing, visible-to-consumer Copilot markers —
is owned by the reviewer roster (Iris / Bodhi / Daya /
Samir / Ilyana / Kai / Rune in their respective scopes)
with Kenji synthesising. The aesthetic and experiential
coherence of the repo is a first-class frontier-protection
surface, not a decoration pass after engineering.

## First-pass confidence + gaps (post v2 edits)

Things Aaron has now stated directly and Kenji is confident about:

- Zeta IS going to be a full database, not a library layer
  below one. "All DB technologies in one big playground."
- Multi-node deployment is in scope.
- The software factory is a first-class product, not a
  means to an end.
- Factory goals: cross-platform, AI-automated, declarative
  dependencies, research-level reproducibility, symmetry,
  production-ready quality, UI someday.
- Pure research/OSS is first-class; commercial is on the
  table but undecided.
- F# primary, polyglot over time.
- Nation-state + supply-chain security posture.
- OpenSpec first-class for every committed artefact.
- NuGet library shipping at v1.0 (the first slice of the
  full database).

Things Aaron resolved this round (round 33 v3 + v4):

- **Zeta name is locked.**
- **SQL frontend is v1**, not post-v1. With tight LINQ
  integration + multiple SQL dialect targets + Entity
  Framework provider first, then other ORMs.
- **F# DSL reimagining SQL is v1** — extension of the
  existing computational-expression sketch.
- **Commercial trigger**: when Aaron uses Zeta in a real
  project for its database.
- **Bitemporal / time-travel: first-class v2.** ("yes
  I want this haha" — framing distinction was noise.)
- **Query IR**: multiple frontends (SQL dialects + LINQ +
  native F# DSL) target one IR that compiles to the DBSP
  operator algebra. Inspiration pattern: SQLSharp's
  "SQL-text and integrated-query flows converge on one
  logical planning pipeline."
- **Reaqtor-shaped niche** (".NET stored procedures"
  — C# AND F# both — as durable Rx-style queries) is
  post-v1 research; genuinely open territory because no
  upstream has Rx, durability, and retraction-native
  semantics in one box.
- **Zeta ships BOTH modes**: event-sourcing (native DBSP)
  together with a regular-database façade (tables-and-SQL
  feel over the same retraction-native core). Replace
  your database AND your event store with one system.
- **Columnar storage likely in scope** alongside the
  row-oriented Spine family. Fits OLAP / analytics /
  wide-row-sparse-projection workloads.

Things Aaron resolved round 33 v5:

- **SQL dialect: PostgreSQL first.** Easier-to-ship +
  good EF integration + huge existing tool ecosystem.
- **License: Apache-2.0.** Landed this round.
- **EF provider: 100% all features.** No partial-provider
  shape; full LINQ + save-changes + migrations + tracking.
- **Admin UI**: Zeta will build its own eventually (long-
  term). In the meantime, speak the PostgreSQL wire
  protocol so existing admin tools connect.
- **F# DSL design**: acknowledged as huge multi-round
  research effort, queued in BACKLOG.

Remaining gaps the product-visionary walks on first
audit (after round 33):

- Wire protocol server: v1 or slip to early post-v1?
  Scope impact is significant.
- Own admin UI: F# + web (Fable? SAFE Stack? Blazor?)
  or native GUI (Avalonia?). Far-future but the choice
  signals the polyglot story.
- Naming within the wire-protocol layer — Zeta as "a
  PostgreSQL" (we emulate) vs "behind Postgres-shaped
  endpoint" (we translate on ingress/egress)?
