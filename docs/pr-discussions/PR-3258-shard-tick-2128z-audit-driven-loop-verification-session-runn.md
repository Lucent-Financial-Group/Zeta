# PR #3258: shard(tick): 2128Z — audit-driven loop verification + session running tally (22 merged + 1 wait-ci)

## PR description

## Summary

Tick 2026-05-14T21:28Z shard. End-to-end verification that the audit-driven loop closed cleanly across the last three ticks, plus codification of 10 patterns from this session for future-Otto cold-boot.

## Audit-driven loop verification

`bun tools/hygiene/audit-backlog-items.ts` on freshly-merged `origin/main` (after #3250 + #3253):

```text
## 3. Broken depends_on pointers
**Broken depends_on edges: 0**

## 4. Broken composes_with pointers
**Broken composes_with edges: 0**

## 8. Duplicate IDs (factory-wide uniqueness violation)
**Duplicate-ID groups: 0**
```

All three ID-integrity classes report 0 issues. End-to-end loop closed:

1. **Tick 2113Z** ([#3250](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3250)) — added duplicate-ID audit class
2. **Tick 2123Z** ([#3253](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3253)) — fixed the broken-composes_with finding it surfaced (filed B-0461)
3. **Tick 2128Z** (this) — verified main reports 0 across all three classes

## Session running tally: 22 merged + 1 wait-ci

| Lane | Merged count |
|---|---|
| Multi-Otto contamination defenses | 5 |
| Cold-boot rule promotion | 1 |
| Tick shards | 10 |
| KSK personas + close-out | 2 |
| BACKLOG.md regen | 1 |
| Audit hygiene | 2 |
| Audit-driven row filing | 1 |
| **TOTAL** | **22** |

Plus [#3256](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3256) (shard 2123Z) wait-ci.

## 10 patterns codified this session (durable substrate)

1. Composite branch-guard at commit time
2. `gh pr create --head <branch>` explicit ref
3. Row-close-out includes BACKLOG.md regen in same PR
4. Tick shards reproduce real command output verbatim
5. Backlog-ID-collision class + `renumbered_from` breadcrumb
6. Three-step propagation (review-time catch → fix → mechanization)
7. Audit-driven workflow (run-time audit → finding → inline fix)
8. `Section:` + blank line + list (MD032)
9. Plist-file machine-specific paths as canonical exception
10. Substantive engagement with AI-reviewer findings

## Prior-tick PRs merged this batch

- [#3253](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3253) → `54236b4` (B-0461 filing)

## Test plan

- [x] `markdownlint-cli2` clean
- [x] Audit shows 0 across all three ID-integrity classes
- [x] Composite branch-guard + `gh pr create --head` used
- [ ] CI clears
- [ ] Auto-merge

## Pull request overview

This PR adds a tick-history shard documenting audit-loop verification, session tally, and durable session patterns for future cold-boot context.

**Changes:**
- Records audit output showing zero broken `depends_on`, `composes_with`, and duplicate-ID issues.
- Adds a session running tally and codifies ten operational patterns from the session.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/2128Z.md:50 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-14T21:31:29Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Reconcile tick-shard merged count with listed PRs**

The `Tick shards` row reports `Merged | 9` but lists ten PR numbers and even ends with `(10)`, which creates an internal contradiction in the session tally. Because this document is used as durable audit substrate for loop accounting, inconsistent counts can propagate incorrect merged-volume metrics and make later verification or trend analysis unreliable.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

### Thread 2: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/2128Z.md:50 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T21:33:16Z):

This row makes the session tally internally inconsistent: the lane says 9 merged tick shards, but the PR list contains ten entries and even annotates “(10)”; with 9 here the lane totals sum to 21, not the stated 22. Update the count so the historical tally is self-consistent.

### Thread 3: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/2128Z.md:108 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T21:33:17Z):

This is written as a path, but `docs/backlog/P3/B-0519-*.md` is not an actual file, so the cross-reference is not navigable. There is a single concrete matching row (`docs/backlog/P3/B-0519-multi-otto-branch-state-contamination-rca-2026-05-14.md`); use that filename instead so future readers can jump to the cited substrate.

## General comments

### @AceHack (2026-05-14T21:37:16Z)

Addressed all three reviewer findings:

1. **Tick-shard count 9→10** (threads by chatgpt-codex-connector + copilot): The PR list had 10 entries (#3231, #3233, #3237, #3240, #3245, #3246, #3248, #3249, #3251, #3252). The running total of 22 is only consistent with count=10 (5+1+10+2+1+2+1=22). Fixed count and removed the trailing "(10)" annotation.

2. **Exact filename for B-0519** (thread by copilot): Replaced glob `B-0519-*.md` with `B-0519-multi-otto-branch-state-contamination-rca-2026-05-14.md` so the cross-reference is directly navigable.

All threads resolved; changes pushed in 6fc2b026.
