# PR #3620: shard(tick): 2300Z — arm-sweep #3617 (merged) + #3618 (armed); Lior-thread PRs left

## PR description

## Summary

- **Cheap-survey discipline**: used `gh pr list --json mergeStateStatus,autoMergeRequest` (single call) instead of `poll-pr-gate-batch --all-open` (37 calls). Composes with `memory/feedback_gh_graphql_rate_limit_cascade_cost_*.md` cost-awareness.
- **2 thread-free arms**: #3618 (B-0544 research) + #3617 (Lior 23:05Z drift; MERGED immediately).
- **2 thread-laden LEFT alone**: #3610 (codex P2 archive-naming) + #3609 (copilot threads on Lior content) — Lior-payload threads pending peer-Lior cycle; respects `honor-those-that-came-before` discipline.

## Test plan

- [x] Budget verified before/after: 4177 → 4151 (26 units this tick — sustainable)
- [x] #3617 confirmed MERGED via gh pr view
- [x] #3618 confirmed armed via gh pr view
- [x] Cron `d97cdace` still listed

## Pull request overview

Adds a new hygiene-history tick shard (2300Z, 2026-05-15) documenting an arm-sweep decision, GitHub rate-limit budgeting, and which PRs were armed vs intentionally left due to thread ownership.

**Changes:**
- Add `2300Z.md` tick shard with frontmatter + narrative sections (refresh, per-PR filter table, budget accounting, CronList check, visibility signal).
- Document “cheap survey” approach (`gh pr list --json ...`) vs batch polling to reduce GraphQL unit burn.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/15/2300Z.md:27 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T23:05:08Z):

Line 27 references the rule as a bare filename (`honor-those-that-came-before.md`). In recent tick shards these rule refs are linked to their canonical `.claude/rules/...` path (so readers can click through and so renames don’t silently break references). Please convert this to a markdown link to `.claude/rules/honor-those-that-came-before.md` using the appropriate relative path from this file.

### Thread 2: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/15/2300Z.md:28 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T23:05:08Z):

`PR-3607.md` is mentioned as if it were an on-repo archive file, but that filename doesn’t exist anywhere in the current tree. If this is a proposed/canonical name that’s missing, consider clarifying that it’s not yet present (or link directly to the relevant preservation doc/PR where the naming question lives) to avoid sending readers on a dead-end search.
