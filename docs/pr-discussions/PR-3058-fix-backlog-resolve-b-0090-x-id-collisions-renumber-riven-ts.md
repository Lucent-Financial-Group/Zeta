# PR #3058: fix(backlog): resolve B-0090.x ID collisions — renumber Riven ts-* series .1-.4 → .5-.8

## PR description

## Summary

Second per-collision cleanup from the [B-0451](docs/backlog/P1/B-0451-duplicate-row-id-substrate-cleanup-2026-05-13.md) sweep. Two complete B-0090 decompositions had landed with overlapping sub-row IDs:

| Sub-ID | First filer (2026-05-10, [#2503](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/2503)) | Second filer (2026-05-11, [#2680](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/2680)) |
|---|---|---|
| B-0090.1 | Riven ts-worktree-survey | lost-substrate-3-bucket-taxonomy |
| B-0090.2 | Riven ts-orphan-branch-survey | worktree-branch-delta-audit |
| B-0090.3 | Riven ts-closed-pr-survey | closed-not-merged-pr-scan |
| B-0090.4 | Riven ts-draft-pr-aged-survey | cadence-and-hygiene-history-hook |

## Resolution

The B-0090 parent body describes the SECOND decomposition explicitly as canonical (3-bucket-taxonomy / worktree-delta / closed-not-merged / cadence-hook, lines 14-17 + 39-42). Per the external-references rule (same as [#3053](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3053), [#3057](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3057)), the second set keeps the original IDs; Riven's ts-* series renumbered as a unit:

```
B-0090.1 → B-0090.5  (TS worktree survey)
B-0090.2 → B-0090.6  (TS orphan branch survey)
B-0090.3 → B-0090.7  (TS closed-PR survey)
B-0090.4 → B-0090.8  (TS draft-PR aged survey)
```

Internal `depends_on: [B-0090.1]` cross-refs in siblings remapped to `B-0090.5` (the renumbered Riven root). Body text references updated. `renumbered_from` + reason recorded in each frontmatter.

## Empirical effect

Inline duplicate-ID count on the branch:

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| 11 dup groups | 7 dup groups |

[B-0451](docs/backlog/P1/B-0451-duplicate-row-id-substrate-cleanup-2026-05-13.md) cleanup progress: **1/12 → 5/12** (B-0068.1 in [#3057](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3057) already merged; B-0090.1-4 in this PR).

Remaining 7: B-0370-0373 (4 cross-priority bleed), B-0409 (3-way), B-0410, B-0411.

## Test plan

- [x] All 4 Riven files renamed + frontmatter id updated + body title updated
- [x] Internal `depends_on` chain remapped (`.6/.7/.8` now point at `.5`)
- [x] `bun tools/backlog/generate-index.ts` regenerated `docs/BACKLOG.md` cleanly
- [x] Inline audit confirms 11 → 7
- [x] Worktree-isolated build (`/tmp/zeta-b0090-fix`)

## Pull request overview

Renames Riven's four B-0090.x atomic child rows (.1-.4 → .5-.8) to resolve ID collisions with a second B-0090 decomposition, remaps internal `depends_on` references, and regenerates the backlog index.

**Changes:**
- Delete old `B-0090.{1,2,3,4}-...riven...md` files and add `B-0090.{5,6,7,8}-...riven...md` with `renumbered_from` + reason frontmatter
- Remap internal `depends_on: [B-0090.1]` → `[B-0090.5]` on the renumbered siblings
- Regenerate `docs/BACKLOG.md` to reflect the new IDs
