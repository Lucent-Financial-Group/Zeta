# PR #3467: shard(tick): 1301Z-01 — drift recalibration per Codex P2

## PR description

Cron-driven autonomous-loop tick. Codex caught real chronology drift on PR #3465; this shard establishes the discipline fix and uses actual UTC at write-time.

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/15/1301Z-01.md:1 (resolved)

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Align shard timestamp minute with filename**

Update the first-row timestamp to match the shard minute bucket: this file is named `1301Z-01.md` and the body says actual UTC was `13:01:56Z`, but column 1 records `2026-05-15T13:02:00Z`. The shard schema expects first-line timestamp/path consistency (see `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/README.md` and `tools/hygiene/check-tick-history-shard-schema.ts`), so this introduces a parse/validation mismatch for tooling that groups or verifies ticks by filename minute.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-15T13:10:18Z):

Fixed in commit `7fe5553`: col1 timestamp updated from `13:02:00Z` to `13:01:56Z` to match filename minute (1301Z). Schema validator (tools/hygiene/check-tick-history-shard-schema.ts:117-125) now passes for this file. Resolving.

### Thread 2: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/15/1301Z-01.md:7 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T13:06:38Z):

This rationale conflicts with the shard README's generator contract: generated history is documented to sort by parsed timestamp prefixes, not git commit dates. If the 1305Z/1309Z filenames are preserved while being described as mislabeled, the future projection will still consume those drifted prefixes unless the files or generator contract are corrected.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-15T13:10:34Z):

Good catch — rationale was sloppy. Updated in `7fe5553` to honestly note the generator sorts by parsed timestamp prefix per shard README, so the drifted prefixes 1305Z.md/1309Z.md DO produce an out-of-order projection until renamed. A follow-up rename pass is acknowledged as load-bearing follow-up work. Today prioritized fixing the discipline going forward. Resolving.

### Thread 3: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/15/1301Z-01.md:1 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T13:06:38Z):

The first-line timestamp is `13:02:00Z`, but the shard path/title and body record this tick as `1301Z` / `13:01:56Z`. The shard schema checker compares col1 `HH:MM` to the filename minute, so this file will fail `check-tick-history-shard-schema.ts` and reintroduces the chronology drift this shard is meant to fix.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-15T13:10:30Z):

Fixed in commit `7fe5553`: col1 timestamp updated from `13:02:00Z` to `13:01:56Z` to match filename minute. Schema validator passes now. Resolving.
