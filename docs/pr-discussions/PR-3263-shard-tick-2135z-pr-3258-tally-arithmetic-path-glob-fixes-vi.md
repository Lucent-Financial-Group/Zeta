# PR #3263: shard(tick): 2135Z — PR #3258 tally arithmetic + path-glob fixes via parallel-Otto convergence

## PR description

## Summary

Tick 2026-05-14T21:35Z shard. Two substantive review catches on [#3258](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3258) addressed via parallel-Otto convergence (another Otto landed the equivalent fix first).

## Catches addressed

1. **Codex + Copilot (independent same finding)** — tally row `Tick shards | 9` contradicted the listed 10 PRs; lane totals summed to 21, not the stated 22.
2. **Copilot** — line 108 used `docs/backlog/P3/B-0519-*.md` glob instead of the concrete filename; not navigable.

## Parallel-Otto convergence pattern

- Authored equivalent fix commit `2f0f577` locally
- Push rejected because another Otto had already pushed commit `6fc2b02` with the same fixes
- Rebase skipped my commit (`skipped previously applied commit 2f0f577` — same tree)
- Verified remote has the correct content; resolved all 3 threads

Unified-identity discipline + shared substrate produced bit-for-bit-equivalent fixes without coordination overhead. Substrate-honest move: **trust the rebase**, don't `push --force`, verify remote state, resolve threads.

## Session running tally: 24 merged + 2 wait-ci

24 merged: #3221, #3222, #3226, #3227, #3228, #3231, #3232, #3233, #3235, #3237, #3239, #3240, #3244, #3245, #3246, #3247, #3248, #3249, #3250, #3251, #3252, #3253, #3256, #3262.

Wait-ci: #3258, this shard's PR.

## Test plan

- [x] All 3 threads on #3258 resolved (`isResolved=true` verified via GraphQL)
- [x] Remote `shard/tick-2128Z-...` has corrected tally + concrete B-0519 filename
- [x] Composite branch-guard + `gh pr create --head`
- [x] `markdownlint-cli2` + `audit-md032-plus-linestart` clean
- [ ] CI clears
- [ ] Auto-merge

## Reviews

### COMMENTED — @copilot-pull-request-reviewer (2026-05-14T21:40:20Z)

## Pull request overview

A tick-history shard documenting work on PR #3258, where two AI reviewers (Codex + Copilot) independently flagged a tally arithmetic error and Copilot caught a glob-path issue, both addressed via parallel-Otto convergence (another Otto landed an identical fix first).

**Changes:**
- Adds a new tick shard file documenting the 2135Z tick.
- Records the parallel-Otto convergence pattern: independently authored equivalent fixes, rebase skipped duplicate commit.
- Updates session running tally (24 merged + 2 wait-ci).
