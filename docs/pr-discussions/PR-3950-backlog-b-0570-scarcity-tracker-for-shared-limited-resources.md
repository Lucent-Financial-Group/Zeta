# PR #3950: backlog(B-0570): scarcity tracker for shared limited resources

## PR description

## Summary

Files B-0570 — design row for a scarcity tracker covering GitHub API GraphQL/REST budgets (and future: runner minutes, etc.). Empirically motivated by today's session saturating 5000/hr GraphQL across 3-4 concurrent agents authenticating as the same user.

## Why now

The 2026-05-16 session demonstrated the failure mode in real time: thread resolution on PR #3945 was blocked ~13 minutes by GraphQL exhaustion. A tracker would have surfaced \`graphql.remaining: 800\` mid-session; agents could have deferred or switched to REST.

## Mitigation axes (sibling rows)

The row's mitigation-axes table identifies 3 orthogonal axes; sibling rows file follow-on work:
- **B-0571** — GitHub App for factory automation (separate rate-limit pool; primary mitigation)
- **B-0572** — LFG GitHub tier audit (XS effort; Enterprise = 3× per-user headroom for free if already paid)
- Per-user-account partition (e.g., Addison's account) — discretionary, no row

## Diff

- \`docs/backlog/P1/B-0570-*.md\` (170 lines) — design row with origin, acceptance criteria, 6-slice decomposition, design sketch, mitigation-axes table, composes-with
- \`docs/BACKLOG.md\` (+1 line) — generated index updated via \`BACKLOG_WRITE_FORCE=1 bun tools/backlog/generate-index.ts\`

## Pull request overview

Adds a new P1 backlog row (B-0570) designing a scarcity tracker for shared limited resources (GitHub API GraphQL/REST budgets, runner minutes, etc.), motivated by a real GraphQL rate-limit exhaustion observed in the 2026-05-16 session. The generated backlog index is updated accordingly.

**Changes:**
- New per-row file `B-0570-...md` with origin, acceptance criteria, 6-slice decomposition, design sketch, and mitigation-axes table
- Regenerated `docs/BACKLOG.md` index to include the new row
