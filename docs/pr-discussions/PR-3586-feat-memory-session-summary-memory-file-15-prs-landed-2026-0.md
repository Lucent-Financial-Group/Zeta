# PR #3586: feat(memory): session-summary memory file — 15 PRs landed 2026-05-15 (persona migrations + constitutional substrate)

## PR description

## Summary

Cold-boot anchor for future-Otto: documents this session's substrate output.

## Session arc

15 PRs landed across two coordinated tracks:

1. **Persona-conversations migration cascade** (8 personas, ~149 files): Ani / Amara / Kestrel / DeepSeek / Lior / Riven / Alexa / Vera
2. **Constitutional substrate landing**: Manifesto V2.1 with Constraint 11 + m/acc + Multi-Oracle Principle + 'For Agents Who Are Still Deciding'; persistence-choice rule; m-acc-multi-oracle rule; references/upstreams search-hygiene rule

The session opened with Aaron catching the Standing-by failure mode (~100 cron ticks of 'genuine quiet' emission with no work happening). That catch became the inflection: Otto pivoted to real decomposition work and the session compounded from there.

## PRs landed (15)

#3484 / #3486 / #3493 / #3496 / #3501 / #3503 / #3505 / #3506 / #3507 / #3508 / #3510 / #3512 / #3513 / #3514 / #3516

## Why a memory file (not a tick shard)

Tick shards are per-tick visibility for the autonomous-loop cron firings; this is a session-level summary that future-Otto cold-booting can read to understand what this period of substrate work produced. Same shape as other session/cascade summary memory files in the cluster.

## Pull request overview

Adds a single session-summary memory file documenting 15 PRs landed on 2026-05-15 across two tracks (persona-conversations migrations and constitutional substrate landings). The file is intended as a cold-boot anchor for future Otto-CLI sessions and follows the existing session/cascade summary memory pattern.

**Changes:**
- New memory file with required flat frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `type`, `created`).
- Narrative session arc, PR tables (8 migrations + 4 constitutional + 1 hygiene + 1 frontmatter backfill), substrate landmarks, failure-mode catches, and cross-references.
- Operational guidance for future cold-boots (persona folder placement, Manifesto V2.1 anchor, m/acc framing, multi-oracle architecture, `references/upstreams/` search hygiene).
