## Pull request overview

Adds a new hygiene-history tick shard documenting the 2026-05-16 05:35Z Otto-CLI session state (rate-limit constrained “pure git” mode) and the discovery that PR #3757 supersedes PR #3746, with a planned post-reset closure.

**Changes:**
- Added tick log `0535Z` capturing refresh status, rate-limit constraints, and planned PR actions.
- Documented comparison between PR #3746 and merged PR #3757, and the intended superseded-close disposition.

* Same issue here: the comparison table starts rows with `||`, creating an unintended empty column. Use the standard markdown table format (`| Aspect | ... | ... |`) to avoid the extra column and keep rendering consistent.

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T06:03:02Z):

The table is formatted with a leading double pipe (`|| ... | ... |`), which renders as an extra empty first column. Other tick shards use the standard `| col | col |` form; please switch to single leading pipes here so the table renders consistently.

This issue also appears on line 26 of the same file.

## General comments

### @AceHack (2026-05-16T06:09:09Z)

Re: Verified FP class per `.claude/rules/blocked-green-ci-investigate-threads.md` ("Table double-pipe"). Direct `awk -v N=<line>` inspection on the merged branch shows single-pipe `|`, not `||`. Resolving no-op — no edit needed.
