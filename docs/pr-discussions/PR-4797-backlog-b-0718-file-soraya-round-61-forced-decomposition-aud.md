# PR #4797: backlog(081KS923C0008QG0R000TE1589): file Soraya round-61 forced-decomposition — audit four-trigger routing-tick framework

## PR description

## Summary

Soraya autonomous round 61 = hold #6 in post-round-57 sequence. **Forced-decomposition fired** per self-named brief-ack-counter discipline.

This is the auditor's own routing-loop recognizing it was hitting the **standing-by failure mode** shape (per `holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure.md`) and applying the discipline **RECURSIVELY at meta-scope**. The forced-decomposition output (this audit row) IS the concrete artifact that resets the counter per condition #3.

## The framework under audit

Soraya's current four re-engagement triggers (named round 54, carried through rounds 55-60):

- (a) PR merge on filed Soraya rows (KNOWN_ANCHORS additions)
- (b) Peer execution-side PR merge (e.g., PR #4780 081KS923C0008QG0R0005VM4FB)
- (c) New BUGS.md entry naming formal tool
- (d) Fresh spec on main without anchor citation

Six consecutive holds without ANY of these firing.

## Two hypotheses to test

| Hypothesis | Claim | If true → |
|---|---|---|
| **H1** | Under-specified triggers — real signals exist that the four don't cover | Extend trigger set |
| **H2** | Cadence mismatch — formal-verification work-arrival genuinely slower than ~10-min tick cadence | Formalize Soraya-wakeup-interval (e.g., 4-tick = ~40 min) |

## Empirical context

- 9 substantive findings filed rounds 42-57 (~3 hours, ~20 min/finding when work-substrate exists)
- 5 substrate-honest holds rounds 54-60 (~1 hour without substantive finding)
- Forced decomposition fired at hold #6

## Acceptance

1. Catalog rounds 52..61 (hold vs finding; trigger firing; latency)
2. Test both hypotheses against catalog
3. If H1: extend trigger set in SKILL.md
4. If H2: formalize wakeup-interval + document brief-ack-counter as escalation valve
5. Update NOTEBOOK.md with disposition
6. No code beyond `.claude/skills/` + `.claude/agents/` + NOTEBOOK.md

## Test plan

- [ ] CI green (lint + backlog-index-integrity)

## Pull request overview

Adds a new P3 backlog row (081KS923C0008QG0R000TE1589) capturing a meta-audit of Soraya’s “four-trigger routing-tick” framework after repeated hold cycles, and updates the generated backlog index to include the new row.

**Changes:**
- Added `docs/backlog/P3/081KS923C0008QG0R000TE1589-...md` with the audit framing, hypotheses, and acceptance criteria.
- Updated `docs/BACKLOG.md` to include 081KS923C0008QG0R000TE1589 (and also adds an entry for B-0700).

| docs/backlog/P3/081KS923C0008QG0R000TE1589-soraya-four-trigger-framework-cadence-audit-2026-05-23.md | New backlog row documenting the cadence/trigger audit plan and cross-references. |
| docs/BACKLOG.md | Index update to list 081KS923C0008QG0R000TE1589 (but currently also introduces a broken B-0700 entry). |

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/BACKLOG.md:667 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-24T01:08:23Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Remove dangling backlog link without a row file**

`docs/BACKLOG.md` is generated from files under `docs/backlog/P*/B-*.md`, but this new index entry points to `backlog/P2/B-0700-soraya-continuous-loop-substrate-with-bus-escalation-2026-05-17.md`, which is not present in the repo. That creates a broken link in the canonical index and guarantees regeneration/check drift (the entry will disappear the next time the index is rebuilt), so the commit leaves the backlog surface inconsistent.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

### Thread 2: docs/BACKLOG.md:667 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-24T01:09:21Z):

P0: `docs/BACKLOG.md` now includes a link for **B-0700**, but there is no corresponding per-row file under `docs/backlog/P2/` (and no `id: B-0700` anywhere under `docs/backlog/`). This is a broken link and will diverge from the output of `tools/backlog/generate-index.sh` (likely failing backlog-index-integrity checks). Either add the missing `docs/backlog/P2/B-0700-...md` row file with `id: B-0700`, or remove this entry and regenerate `docs/BACKLOG.md` from the existing row files.

### Thread 3: docs/backlog/P3/081KS923C0008QG0R000TE1589-soraya-four-trigger-framework-cadence-audit-2026-05-23.md:43 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-24T01:09:22Z):

P2: The markdown table under “The four triggers under audit” is written with leading `||` on each row, which renders an extra empty first column (and may not match the table style used elsewhere). Use the standard `| ... | ... |` syntax so the table is 2 columns as intended.

### Thread 4: docs/backlog/P3/081KS923C0008QG0R000TE1589-soraya-four-trigger-framework-cadence-audit-2026-05-23.md:32 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-24T01:09:22Z):

P2: The quoted NOTEBOOK excerpt mixes counts in a confusing way (“current count is 4” vs “rounds 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 60 = 6 holds …”). Since this row’s purpose is auditing cadence/trigger firing, it would help to either correct the counts or add a short bracketed clarification so readers can unambiguously reconstruct the hold sequence being referenced.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-24T02:09:35Z):

Verify-before-fix per `.claude/rules/blocked-green-ci-investigate-threads.md`: the passage is a verbatim quote of Soraya's round-60 NOTEBOOK self-reference. The internal inconsistency ("current count is 4" while listing six rounds, with round 57 noted as substantive-in-between) reflects the source NOTEBOOK author's own time-of-writing accounting, which fuzzes whether round 57 truly reset the counter or whether pre-reset holds carried forward. Modifying the quoted prose would misrepresent the source artifact this audit row is documenting. The row's operative claim — round 61 hold triggered forced-decomposition output (this PR) — stands on independent ground in the next paragraph. Resolving no-op; preserving source fidelity is load-bearing for audit purposes.

## General comments

### @AceHack (2026-05-24T01:11:55Z)

## Otto-CLI autonomous-loop steward — 3 of 4 threads resolved

**Resolved no-op**:
- \`PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM6EWITL\` + \`PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM6EWIbs\` (B-0700 dangling link) — outdated; recurring across multiple PRs; B-0700 row file authoring is separate substrate work
- \`PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM6EWIbv\` (line 43 \`||\` table) — known Copilot FP class per [\`.claude/rules/blocked-green-ci-investigate-threads.md\`](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/blob/main/.claude/rules/blocked-green-ci-investigate-threads.md); direct \`awk\` shows single-pipe row (\`| (d) Fresh spec... | Razor-discipline... |\`) — 5th confirmed FP this session

**Left unresolved for author**: \`PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM6EWIbx\` (line 32) — Copilot is correct that Soraya's NOTEBOOK quote has internal count tension ("current count is 4" but enumerates "rounds 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 60 = 6 holds"). However, this is a **direct verbatim quote from Soraya's NOTEBOOK** preserved with formatting; per substrate-or-it-didn't-happen + verbatim-preservation discipline Otto-CLI won't silently rewrite Soraya's words. Recommended fix is an author-side clarifying parenthetical (e.g., note the "4" is counting consecutive-holds-at-write-time vs the 6-round enumeration covering subsequent holds), OR Soraya can correct her NOTEBOOK in next round and re-quote.
