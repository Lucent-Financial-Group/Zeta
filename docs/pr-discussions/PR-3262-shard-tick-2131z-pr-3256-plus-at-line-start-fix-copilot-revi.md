# PR #3262: shard(tick): 2131Z — PR #3256 plus-at-line-start fix (Copilot review)

## PR description

## Summary

Tick 2026-05-14T21:31Z shard. Substantive work was a thread fix on [#3256](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3256): Copilot caught a wrapped continuation line starting with `+` inside a `-` bullet — markdownlint parses that as a new list item with a different bullet style.

## What landed

- **Commit `9c4590e` on PR [#3256](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3256)'s branch** — rewrote the wrapped continuation as prose so no line starts with `+`. Thread resolved.
- This shard.

## Repo has dedicated audit for this class

The fix used [`tools/hygiene/audit-md032-plus-linestart.ts`](tools/hygiene/audit-md032-plus-linestart.ts) for the proactive sweep — empty result across all today's shards after the fix.

## Pre-push catch

Pre-lint of this shard caught a fresh MD018 (ATX-heading-missing-space): line starting with `#3256.` parsed as an ATX heading missing a space. Prefixed with `PR ` so the line doesn't start with `#`. Cheap pre-push lint catches it before CI.

## Pattern codified

When authoring tick shards with structured content (bulleted descriptions of file sections), use plain prose for the description rather than `+`-separated lists inside existing `-` bullets. Also avoid `#NNN` at line start when referencing PRs — prefix with `PR `.

## Test plan

- [x] `markdownlint-cli2` clean on the fixed 2123Z shard
- [x] `markdownlint-cli2` clean on this shard
- [x] `audit-md032-plus-linestart --list` empty across today's shards
- [x] Thread resolved via GraphQL
- [x] Composite branch-guard + `gh pr create --head` used
- [ ] CI clears
- [ ] Auto-merge

## Pull request overview

This PR adds a single tick-shard markdown file documenting work performed in tick 2026-05-14T21:31Z: addressing a Copilot review finding on PR #3256 about a wrapped continuation line starting with `+` inside a `-` bullet (markdownlint hazard), plus a proactive sweep using the repo's dedicated audit tool.

**Changes:**
- New hygiene-history tick shard recording the `+`-at-line-start fix and resolution of the Copilot thread on PR #3256.
- Documents the dual-audit pattern (`audit-md032-plus-linestart.ts` + `markdownlint-cli2`) for future shard authoring.
