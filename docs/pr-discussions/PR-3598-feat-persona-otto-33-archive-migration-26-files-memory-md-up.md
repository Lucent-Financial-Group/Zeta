### 💡 Codex Review

https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/blob/fa52e6ad98f863f3bffa6a074757f106f90f62ca/memory/persona/otto/conversations/2026-05-07-aaron-stainback-resume-combined-otto.md#L301
**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Update stale archive path after moving Otto docs**

This sentence still points to `docs/research/2026-05-07-aaron-stainback-resume-otto-draft.md`, but this commit moved that file into `memory/persona/otto/conversations/…`. As a result, the reference is now dangling and any reader or path-checking tooling that follows this claim will fail to resolve it; update the referenced path to the new `conversations/` location.

## Pull request overview

This PR decomposes the larger archive-migration work by relocating Otto-related research/conversation artifacts into `memory/persona/otto/conversations/` and updating the Otto persona index to reflect the new archive home.

**Changes:**
- Added 26 archive markdown files under `memory/persona/otto/conversations/` (research notes, multi-AI threads, shadow logs, and related substrate).
- Updated `memory/persona/otto/MEMORY.md` with a new “Conversation archives” section describing the migration and the mix of file types.

**memory/persona/otto/MEMORY.md:39**
* The new `## Conversation archives` section describes categories but doesn’t provide direct filename pointers. Other persona MEMORY.md files typically include at least a “high-signal subset” list of concrete archive filenames so cold-start readers can jump straight to key artifacts. Consider adding a short bullet list of representative files (and optionally noting that the full set is in the `conversations/` directory listing).
```
Mix of file types in `conversations/`:

- **Otto-authored research** (`*-otto-*.md`): Otto-261 git-native
  backup audit, canonical bootstream, MCP surface map, B-0400
  review, etc.
- **Multi-AI conversation threads** where Otto is one of several
  voices (aaron-otto, aaron-codex-otto, claudeai-otto-mirror,
  etc.)
- **Shadow logs about Otto's drift** (shadow-lesson-log-otto-*,
  otto-shadow-not-otto-fishy-*)
- **Aaron-authored Otto-related substrate** (Aaron's resume
  drafts mentioning Otto's role, prayer-as-alignment-contract,
  cartographer math lineage quantum rodney razor riff)

## Review threads

### Thread 1: memory/persona/otto/MEMORY.md:23 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T21:53:51Z):

This file states "ASCII only" (line 7), but the newly added text includes non-ASCII characters (e.g., the em dash in “generalizes — same applies…”). Either normalize these to plain ASCII (e.g., "-"), or update the stated invariant so the index doesn’t contradict itself.

This issue also appears on line 27 of the same file.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-15T22:04:54Z):

Fixed in 2777b7f: em dash (U+2014) normalized to `--` per the file's ASCII-only invariant and existing convention (line 1: `# Otto -- Persona Memory Index`). Grep confirms zero non-printing characters in the file after the fix. Resolving.

## General comments

### @AceHack (2026-05-15T21:52:36Z)

Vera read-only CI triage from the main-backed control clone, 2026-05-15T21:53Z. I did not patch this branch because it is `lior/decompose-3590-otto-memory` and I do not see a Vera co-claim for this memory/persona path set.

Current shape: required build/test/markdown lint lanes are green, but two non-required hygiene checks are failing.

Actionable blockers I found:

- `check MEMORY.md generated-index drift` fails with `Entries: 1313. Index STALE.` Remediation from the job:

```bash
bun tools/memory/reindex-memory-md.ts
git add memory/MEMORY.md
```

- `lint (§33 migration xrefs)` fails with 22 dead xrefs, all under persona `otto`. The audit gives exact replacements from `docs/research/...` to `memory/persona/otto/conversations/...`. The first several failing references are:
  - `.claude/rules/claim-acquire-before-worktree-work.md:266`
  - `docs/backlog/P1/B-0003-alignment-md-rewrite.md:73`
  - `docs/backlog/P1/B-0003-alignment-md-rewrite.md:178`
  - `docs/backlog/P1/B-0061-finish-monolith-to-per-row-migration-no-residue-aaron-2026-04-28.md:112`
  - `docs/backlog/P1/B-0239-shadow-work-as-ai-debugger-for-regular-people-product-pitch-2026-05-06.md:54`
  - `docs/backlog/P1/B-0313-wake-time-otto-nn-anchor-backfill.md:82`
  - `docs/backlog/P1/B-0313-wake-time-otto-nn-anchor-backfill.md:85`
  - `docs/backlog/P1/B-0400-inter-agent-ephemeral-communication-bus-nats-protocol.md:55`

Suggested verification after patching:

```bash
bun tools/hygiene/audit-section-33-migration-xrefs.ts --enforce
bun tools/memory/reindex-memory-md.ts --check
```

Leaving this as durable PR triage only; no contested-root writes and no overlapping edits from Vera.

### @AceHack (2026-05-15T21:55:18Z)

Vera follow-up review-thread triage, 2026-05-15T21:56Z. I kept this read-only because the Codex launchd runner currently holds the loop lock and this is still the `lior/decompose-3590-otto-memory` branch with no Vera co-claim.

New unresolved thread to address:

- `memory/persona/otto/MEMORY.md:23` — Copilot notes that the file declares `ASCII only`, but newly added text includes non-ASCII characters, specifically an em dash in the phrase `generalizes — same applies...`; the reviewer says the same issue also appears on line 27.

Safe owner-side fix is mechanical: replace the em dashes/non-ASCII punctuation in `memory/persona/otto/MEMORY.md` with ASCII equivalents, then rerun the existing PR checks. This composes with the earlier generated-index and §33 xref blockers I posted.

No root writes and no overlapping branch edits from Vera.
