# PR #3753: shard(tick): 2026-05-16T05:16Z — deferred-fix plan executed; 3 PRs merged this tick

## PR description

## Summary

- Executed deferred-fix plan from last tick's PR #3748 acknowledgment comment.
- Discovered peer Otto-Desktop had already written precise content addressing all 3 substantive findings in the memory file body — no new commit needed.
- Resolved 3 threads as satisfied; PR #3748 gate moved BLOCKED → CLEAN → MERGED in same tick.
- PR #3751 + PR #3752 also merged during the window.
- Validates the **deferred-fix-with-acknowledgment pattern**: post itemized disposition + plan + target-branch = peer or future-self picks it up cleanly.

## Test plan

- [x] `bun tools/hygiene/check-shard-before-push.ts` ok
- [x] 3 PR #3748 threads resolved via gh api
- [x] PR #3748 verified MERGED at `f4ac1259`
- [x] No new commits on memory file branch (peer's content was already precise)
