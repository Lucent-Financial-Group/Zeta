# PR #3619: backlog(B-0545): B-0498 ID collision — renumber sweep (Riven cursor-terminal → next ID)

## PR description

## Summary

- **Real ID collision** caught by `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` on PR #3604 (tick shard 2217Z thread):
  - `docs/backlog/P1/B-0498-riven-cursor-terminal-*-2026-05-15.md` (from merged #3603)
  - `docs/backlog/P2/B-0498-substrate-evolution-algebra-*-2026-05-14.md` (pre-existing)
- Per `b0451_per_collision_renumber_procedure`: first-merged-wins → P2 (2026-05-14) keeps B-0498; P1 (2026-05-15) renumbers to next free (B-0546).
- This row IS the filed-correction surface; implementation in a follow-up PR.
- P2 priority — collision exists but no active break; address within 1-2 weeks.

## Test plan

- [x] Verified via `git ls-tree origin/main -- docs/backlog/` — both files exist
- [x] Rule discipline confirmed via memory file lookup
- [x] B-0545 ID allocated via on-disk + in-flight check (B-0543/0544 in #3614; B-0545 free)
- [ ] Implementation PR (renumber sweep) to follow

## Pull request overview

Adds a new P2 backlog row (B-0545) to document and track the discovered B-0498 ID collision, and to define the intended renumber target/sweep scope for a follow-up implementation PR.

**Changes:**
- Introduces backlog row B-0545 describing the B-0498 collision (P1 vs P2 rows) and the “first-merged-wins” renumber procedure reference.
- Captures proposed renumber target (B-0546) and a checklist of cross-reference updates to perform in the implementation sweep.
- Records rationale for P2 priority and scope-bounds (filed-correction surface only).

* P1: The example command `gh pr list --search "B-NNNN" --state all` won’t actually enumerate the in-flight IDs you list below (it searches for the literal string `B-NNNN`). Use a concrete search term/pattern that matches real PR titles (e.g., the specific IDs, or a prefix like `B-054`), or reword this to describe the check without giving a non-functional command.
```
## Next free ID

At time of filing (2026-05-15T22:55Z), `git ls-tree origin/main` plus `gh pr list --search "B-NNNN" --state all` shows:

- B-0542 last on main
- B-0543/B-0544 taken in flight (PR #3614, OPEN)
- B-0545 — THIS ROW, claimed
- **B-0546** — next free for the renumber target
```
**docs/backlog/P2/B-0545-b0498-collision-renumber-sweep-2026-05-15.md:70**
* P1: `tick-shards-are-immutable` is referenced as if it’s a named rule, but there’s no such rule/doc in the repo; this reads like a dead xref. Consider linking to an existing authority that states shard immutability (e.g., `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/README.md`, which describes shards as immutable events) or rename this to the actual rule/document name.
```
- Update `id:` frontmatter inside the moved file
- Update any `depends_on:` / `composes_with:` fields in OTHER backlog rows that pointed at B-0498 in the Riven sense
- Update tick shards that QUOTE the Riven B-0498: PER `tick-shards-are-immutable` discipline, do NOT in-place-edit; instead, append a correction note in a new shard OR add a glossary entry in the renumber row
- Update any tools/scripts: rename references via `grep -rln "B-0498-riven\|B-0498.*riven" memory/ docs/ .claude/ tools/`
```
**docs/backlog/P2/B-0545-b0498-collision-renumber-sweep-2026-05-15.md:88**
* P2: In the “Composes with” section, `claim-acquire-before-worktree-work.md` and `refresh-before-decide.md` are referenced as bare filenames, but the canonical paths are under `.claude/rules/…`. Consider linking them with their full repo paths (as other backlog rows do) so readers can navigate unambiguously.
```
## Composes with

- The `b0451_per_collision_renumber_procedure` memory (2026-05-14) — same shape, second instance
- The `claim-acquire-before-worktree-work.md` rule's "ID allocation discipline" section — this collision is an instance the discipline is meant to prevent
- `refresh-before-decide.md` invariant at ID-allocation scope — both surfaces (merged + in-flight) must be checked; the Riven-cursor row at 2026-05-15 likely skipped the on-disk B-0498 P2 check
```

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/backlog/P2/B-0545-b0498-collision-renumber-sweep-2026-05-15.md:66 (unresolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-15T23:02:31Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Replace wildcard destination in rename command**

The documented sweep command uses a wildcard in the destination (`git mv ... B-0546-riven-*`), which is unsafe in Bash because unmatched destination globs are passed literally; running this as written can rename the file to a path containing a `*` character instead of the intended concrete filename. In the renumber workflow, that would leave the backlog row under an invalid/unexpected name and likely break follow-up references/indexing, so the command should name the exact target file (or compute it programmatically) rather than using a wildcard destination.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

### Thread 2: docs/backlog/P2/B-0545-b0498-collision-renumber-sweep-2026-05-15.md:7 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T23:03:16Z):

P1: This backlog row frontmatter is missing the required `last_updated` field (the backlog schema requires it and it should be updated on every content edit). Add `last_updated: 2026-05-15` (or the correct date) to the YAML frontmatter to keep the row schema-compliant.
