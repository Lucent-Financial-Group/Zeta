# PR #3154: shard(tick): 1813Z — PR #3153 thread resolution (verified parallel-Otto find-portability fix)

## PR description

## Summary

Tick shard for 2026-05-14T18:13Z.

PR #3153 (Aaron-authored, ID-allocation discipline section for otto-channels rule) was BLOCKED on a Codex P2 thread flagging `find ... -printf` as GNU-only (fails on BSD/macOS find).

**Investigation**: another agent had already pushed commit `1636908` with the portable-find fix (Aaron + Co-Authored-Claude). The fix replaces `-printf` with the portable `find ... -type f | grep -oE "B-[0-9]+"` pattern. The code was correct; only the thread close was missing.

**Otto-CLI's contribution this tick**: verified portability on this BSD-find macOS environment + closed the Codex thread via GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` mutation.

PR #3153 now wait-ci (6/7 required ok, 1 in-progress, threads:0, autoMerge armed).

## Parallel-Otto coordination pattern observed

Canonical work distribution: one agent ships the code fix, a second agent verifies + signs off. Both halves needed to clear the gate. The thread-resolution half is invisible from CI logs but observable from the GraphQL `reviewThreads` query.

## Cleanup

Removed stale `/private/tmp/zeta-otto-id-alloc` worktree (4h-old leftover from yesterday's session crash; PR #3153 body confirms original session was lost). 22 other prunable worktrees still listed — would benefit from periodic `git worktree prune` cadence.

## Test plan

- [x] Verified portable find command: `find docs/backlog -name "B-*.md" -type f | grep -oE "B-[0-9]+" | sort -u -t- -k2 -n | tail -5` → returns top row IDs as expected
- [x] Codex thread `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM6CJju2` resolved
- [x] PR #3153 gate transitioned BLOCKED→wait-ci
- [x] Cron sentinel still armed

## Pull request overview

This PR adds a single tick-history shard documenting the Otto-CLI agent's work resolving a Codex P2 review thread on PR #3153. The shard records verification of a portable `find` command fix authored in parallel by another agent, closure of the review thread via GraphQL, and cleanup of a stale worktree.

**Changes:**
- Adds new tick-history shard at `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/1813Z.md` documenting PR #3153 thread resolution
- Records parallel-Otto coordination pattern (one agent fixes, another verifies + closes thread)
- Notes stale-worktree cleanup and suggests periodic `git worktree prune` cadence
