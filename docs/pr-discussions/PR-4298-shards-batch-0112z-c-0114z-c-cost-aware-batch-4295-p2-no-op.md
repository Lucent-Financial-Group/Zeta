# PR #4298: shards(batch 0112Z-c..0114Z-c): cost-aware batch + 4295 P2 no-op

3 local shards batched + 4295 P2 markdown ordered-list no-op resolved.

## Reviews

### COMMENTED — @copilot-pull-request-reviewer (2026-05-19T01:16:45Z)

## Pull request overview

Adds three new hygiene-history tick shard entries for 2026-05-19 (0112Z-c, 0113Z-c, 0114Z-c), documenting a cost-aware batching decision and recording that #4295’s P2 markdown ordered-list finding was a no-op / immutable-shard case.

**Changes:**
- Add tick shard `0112Z-c` capturing brief-ack status and batching intent.
- Add tick shard `0113Z-c` capturing brief-ack status and sentinel liveness.
- Add tick shard `0114Z-c` capturing the substantive note about #4297 merged and #4295 P2 markdown no-op resolution, plus batching context.
