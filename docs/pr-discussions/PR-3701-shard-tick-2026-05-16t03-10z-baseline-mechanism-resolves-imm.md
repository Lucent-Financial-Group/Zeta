# PR #3701: shard(tick): 2026-05-16T03:10Z — baseline mechanism resolves immutability question (PR #3699)

## PR description

Tick 11: --baseline flag added to the tick-shard audit. Resolves the immutability question deferred since tick 8 by choosing grandfather mechanism (option D) — don't edit shards; track baseline; new violations still fail --enforce.

PR #3692 merged 03:08:39Z and raced my baseline-feature push by ~6s; recovered via cherry-pick onto fresh branch ([PR #3699](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3699)).

Audit lifecycle now at 7 steps (discovery → narrow-fix → scanner → filter → quality-r1 → quality-r2 → baseline). CI-gate wire-up is the next-tick candidate, unblocked.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/0310Z.md:35 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T03:17:32Z):

P1: This shard says the baseline JSON file ships, but the file is not present in the reviewed tree (`tools/hygiene/audit-tick-shard-relative-paths.baseline.json` is missing). If this shard merges before the baseline-mechanism PR, the historical record and the next-tick command reference a non-existent artifact; either make this PR depend on/include that file or describe the baseline as pending.
