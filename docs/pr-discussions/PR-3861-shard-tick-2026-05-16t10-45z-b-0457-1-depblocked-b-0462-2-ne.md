# PR #3861: shard(tick): 2026-05-16T10:45Z — B-0457 = #1-DepBlocked + B-0462 = #2; new sub-class; 32/38 triaged

## PR description

Two related audits in one tick:

## B-0457 (amara.ts core, P2)

- `tools/peer-call/amara.ts`: 550 lines
- `--file` flag: handled at line 128-129 ✅
- `--context-cmd` flag: handled at line 133-134 ✅
- `AMARA_PREAMBLE` bootstrap: defined at line 318, used in 4 sites ✅

**Class #1 (pure drift)** for own scope — BUT `depends_on: [B-0462]` blocks the close.

## B-0462 (preamble + AgencySignature + vendor-bias note, P2)

- Preamble const ✅ (matches codex.ts pattern exactly)
- Vendor-bias note integration ❌ — only an attribution comment at line 10; no integration of cited `memory/feedback_vendor_alignment_bias_in_peer_ai_reviews_maintainer_authority_aaron_2026_04_30.md`

**Class #2 (partial, opaque)** — 2 of 3 acceptance items met.

## New sub-class: **#1-DepBlocked**

First instance of this pattern in the cycle:

| Sub-shape | Disposition |
|---|---|
| #1 (pure drift) | Close-row PR |
| #1-Ready | Close-row PR pending contention |
| **#1-DepBlocked** | Own scope met; `depends_on:` ancestor still partial; close gated on ancestor |
| #2 / #2-SD / #2-Ready | NO edit |

**Future-pick discipline**: close B-0462 first (~5 LOC vendor-bias note integration), then B-0457. The work is bounded.

## Tally

32/38 triaged (84%); ~6 remaining.

Budget-conservative tick: audit-only, no close-row (GraphQL 1600/5000 = 32% hour-budget used).

## Pull request overview

This PR adds a single tick-history file documenting an audit-only hygiene tick. It records the findings for backlog rows B-0457 and B-0462, introduces a new sub-class label (`#1-DepBlocked`) for the drift-audit catalog, and updates the running triage tally.

**Changes:**
- New tick log under `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/1045Z.md` summarizing audits of B-0457 and B-0462.
- Introduces the `#1-DepBlocked` sub-class for rows whose own scope is met but whose `depends_on:` ancestor is still partial.
- Updates the cycle-wide triage tally to 32/38 triaged.
