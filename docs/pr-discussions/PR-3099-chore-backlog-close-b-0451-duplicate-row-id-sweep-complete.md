# PR #3099: chore(backlog): close B-0451 — duplicate row-ID sweep complete

## PR description

## Summary

- Closes B-0451 (Duplicate row-ID substrate cleanup, P1)
- The 12-collision sweep completed across PRs #3056–#3073 (merged 2026-05-13) but the row status was never updated to `closed`
- Verified: `bun tools/bg/audit-duplicate-row-ids.ts` exits 0 — "561 rows with id field, no duplicate IDs"

## Changes

**`docs/backlog/P1/B-0451-*.md`** — `status: open → closed`; ACs checked off:
- [x] All 12 colliding groups resolved (across PRs #3056–#3073)
- [x] `audit-duplicate-row-ids.ts` exits 0 on main — verified 2026-05-14
- [x] All cross-references updated (renumbered rows carry `renumbered_from` provenance)
- [x] `docs/BACKLOG.md` regenerated
- [ ] CI wiring — documented as future work (separate slice; does not block closure)

**`docs/BACKLOG.md`** — `[ ]` → `[x]` for B-0451

**`docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/0521Z.md`** — per-tick shard

## Test plan

- [x] `bun tools/bg/audit-duplicate-row-ids.ts` — exits 0, "561 rows, no duplicate IDs"
- [x] `dotnet build -c Release` — 0 warnings, 0 errors
