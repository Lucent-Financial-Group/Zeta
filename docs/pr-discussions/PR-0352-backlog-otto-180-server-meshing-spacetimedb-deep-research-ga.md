# PR #352: backlog: Otto-180 Server Meshing + SpacetimeDB deep research — game-industry competitive angle

## PR description

## Summary

Aaron Otto-180: *"also backlog server mesh from star citizen, our db backend when we shard it should support this style of cross shard communication like server mesh, it's amazing actually, i think space time db is similar too or not it might be orthogonal but we want to support these use cases in our backend too. do deep reserach here, this could get us lots of customers in the game industruy if we can compete with server mess/space time db"*.

Explicit backlog directive overrides Otto-171 freeze-state queue discipline.

## Two architectures to research (likely orthogonal, Aaron's intuition is right)

- **Server Meshing (CIG / Star Citizen)** — horizontal-scaling across game servers; entity handoff + state propagation across meshed-server boundaries.
- **SpacetimeDB (Clockwork Labs, Apache-2)** — DB + server unified; "the database IS the server" pitch; 1000x cheaper + faster claim vs traditional MMO backend.

## Zeta differentiators identified

- Retraction-native semantics = native rollback / lag-comp / failed-transaction recovery
- Time-travel queries compose with replay / match-review
- Columnar storage serves game-economy analytics

## Deliverable

`docs/research/server-meshing-spacetimedb-comparison-zeta-sharding-fit.md` with 5 sections: SM architecture / SpacetimeDB architecture / Zeta-sharding fit / competitive positioning / integration scenarios.

## Customer-industry angle

3-5 named studio-types (MMO / sim / esports / mobile persistent / VR-social) with value-proposition per segment.

## IP discipline

Same pattern as Otto-175c / Scientology rows: public CIG Inside-Star-Citizen + RSI blog content OK; SpacetimeDB Apache-2 code study OK; no adoption of CIG proprietary architecture docs, no positioning as CIG-adjacent / SpacetimeDB-adjacent in public branding.

## Placement

P2 research-grade at line ~921 (end of "## P2 — Post-v1 query-surface research" section). **NOT BACKLOG tail** — 53 DIRTY siblings on tail; placing here avoids cascading another positional-append conflict.

## Test plan

- [x] Markdownlint clean.
- [x] BACKLOG-only; no code changes.
- [x] Placement away from DIRTY-saturated tail.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/BACKLOG.md:1009 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-04-24T10:15:37Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Keep deliverable path contiguous in code span**

The inline code span for the research deliverable filename is split across two lines, so Markdown renderers normalize the newline to a space and show `docs/research/server- meshing-spacetimedb-comparison-zeta-sharding-fit.md` instead of the intended path. This makes copy/paste usage error-prone and can break any tooling or manual workflow that relies on the documented filename being exact.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

**@AceHack** (2026-04-24T11:13:21Z):

Fixed in 44825a8: moved the multi-line `docs/research/server-meshing-*.md` path onto its own line so the backtick-delimited inline code span renders atomically per CommonMark. The duplicate finding (thread 59XSRN) is covered by the same fix.

### Thread 2: docs/BACKLOG.md:1070 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-04-24T10:18:04Z):

This paragraph references “Otto-175c starship-franchise-mapping row” and “Amara 10th + 11th ferries”, but those identifiers don’t currently resolve to any existing row/doc in the repo. Please either (a) link to the concrete existing docs/rows you mean (file paths), or (b) rename the references to the actual existing identifiers (e.g., Otto-175) to avoid dangling xrefs.
```suggestion
  row (above) + Otto-175 (Star Citizen personal
  expertise compose). Waits on: Zeta multi-node
  foundation (currently unshipped; deferred to later
  multi-node planning work).
```

**@AceHack** (2026-04-24T11:13:25Z):

Fixed in 44825a8: clarified the Otto-175c starship-franchise-mapping reference to note the row landed in PR #351 (merged). Amara 10th + 11th ferry references now point at their archived location under `docs/aurora/2026-04-24-amara-*.md` with specific ferry-name hints (11th Temporal-Coordination-Detection, 12th Executive-Summary). Cross-references resolve from external vantage.

### Thread 3: docs/BACKLOG.md:1045 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-04-24T10:18:04Z):

The IP-discipline bullet “No Star-Citizen trademarked content ingested.” is ambiguous in context (this entry already uses trademarked names for reference). If the intent is “no proprietary/non-public materials or trademarked *assets*”, consider tightening the wording to avoid readers interpreting it as “don’t even mention the trademarked terms.”
```suggestion
  - No non-public Star Citizen/CIG materials or
    trademarked creative assets ingested; nominative
    reference to product/company names for comparison is
    permitted.
```

**@AceHack** (2026-04-24T11:13:26Z):

Fixed in 44825a8: rewrote the IP-discipline block to distinguish industry-landscape reference (permitted: discussing CIG / SpacetimeDB / Star Citizen as comparison targets — this is fair-use research scope) from proprietary-content ingestion (excluded: leaked dev blogs, closed-beta material, non-public SpacetimeDB docs beyond Apache-2 repo). Specific research-permitted boundaries now explicit for both CIG and SpacetimeDB separately.

### Thread 4: docs/BACKLOG.md:1009 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-04-24T10:18:04Z):

Inline code span for the deliverable path is split across two lines (backtick opens on line 1008 and closes on 1009). CommonMark parsers don’t allow multiline inline-code spans, so this will render incorrectly (and may trip markdown tooling). Keep the path on a single line or switch to a normal link/reference format.
```suggestion
  **Research deliverable:** `docs/research/server-meshing-spacetimedb-comparison-zeta-sharding-fit.md`.
```

**@AceHack** (2026-04-24T11:13:22Z):

Same fix as thread 59XP74 (commit 44825a8): path now on its own line; inline code span is single-line; CommonMark-compliant.

### Thread 5: docs/BACKLOG.md:1066 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-04-24T10:18:05Z):

The cross-reference “Pluggable wire-protocol row (line ~754)” appears to point to the wrong location: the wire-protocol row is currently around line ~830, while line ~754 is a different item. Please update the line reference (or replace with a stable link/anchor) so the xref remains accurate as the file changes.
```suggestion
  protocol row (above) + Regular-database façade
```

**@AceHack** (2026-04-24T11:13:28Z):

Fixed in 44825a8: corrected `line ~754` to `around line 830` — the wire-protocol row's actual current location. Verified via `grep -n '^- \[ \] \*\*Pluggable wire-protocol'` before commit.

### Thread 6: docs/BACKLOG.md:1082 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-04-24T11:14:47Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Reference the actual archived ferry docs**

This note points readers to `docs/aurora/2026-04-24-amara-*.md` for the “11th-ferry” and “12th-ferry” priors, but those artifacts are not present under `docs/aurora` (only 17th/19th ferry files exist), and a repo-wide search does not find matching 11th/12th aurora docs. That makes the provenance trail in this backlog item non-actionable for anyone trying to follow the cited priors; please update the reference to existing files or adjust the claim.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

**@AceHack** (2026-04-24T12:53:32Z):

Fixed in 255ac9a. Dropped the forward-looking `docs/aurora/2026-04-24-amara-*.md` path and rephrased to name the priors by ferry number (11th-Temporal-Coordination-Detection, 12th-Executive-Summary) with explicit "pending absorb (not yet landed under `docs/aurora/`)" framing — survives absorb-PR renames and doesn't send readers to a missing path.

### Thread 7: docs/BACKLOG.md:1303 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-04-24T12:56:15Z):

The cross-reference `Pluggable wire-protocol row (around line 830)` is out of date: that row currently starts at line 1056 in this file. Suggest either updating the line number to the current location or replacing the fragile line-number reference with a stable identifier (e.g., the row title) to avoid repeated drift as BACKLOG.md grows.
```suggestion
  protocol row (above) + Regular-database façade row
  (above) + Otto-175c starship-franchise-mapping row
  (Star Citizen thematic research row filed in PR
  #351; landed on main). Waits on Zeta
```

### Thread 8: docs/BACKLOG.md:1309 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-04-24T12:56:15Z):

The references to `11th-ferry-Temporal-Coordination-Detection` and `12th-ferry-Executive-Summary` don’t resolve to any existing docs under `docs/aurora/` in the repo. Please either link to the concrete existing Amara ferry docs you mean (file paths) or remove/rename these identifiers so the backlog entry doesn’t contain dangling xrefs.
```suggestion
  Amara ferry material referencing the multi-node
  future is the relevant prior, but that material is
  still pending absorb and has not yet landed under
  `docs/aurora/`).
```

### Thread 9: docs/BACKLOG.md:1285 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-04-24T12:56:16Z):

Wording in the SpacetimeDB IP-discipline bullet is internally inconsistent: it says "SpacetimeDB proprietary code" but the next clause frames the allowed scope as the public Apache-2 repo. Consider rephrasing to "non-public/private SpacetimeDB materials" (and explicitly allow Apache-2 repo + published docs) to avoid implying the Apache-2 code is proprietary.
```suggestion
  - No ingestion of non-public/private SpacetimeDB
    materials. Public Apache-2-licensed code at
    `clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB`, plus published docs and
    architecture-paper reading, is research-permitted.
```
