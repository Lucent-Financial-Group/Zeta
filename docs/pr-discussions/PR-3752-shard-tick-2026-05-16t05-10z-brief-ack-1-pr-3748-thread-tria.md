## Pull request overview

Adds a new hygiene-history tick shard capturing the 2026-05-16T05:10Z Otto-CLI session brief-ack and the per-thread triage outcomes for PR #3748, including current refresh state and the rationale for not opening additional PRs during active CI waits.

**Changes:**
- Added a new tick log entry documenting refresh status (main SHA, rate limit, PR states) at tick-open.
- Recorded PR #3748 review-thread triage dispositions (1 resolved as stale, 3 deferred to a follow-up commit).
- Linked the brief-ack decision back to the “holding without a named dependency” rule and summarized active named-dependency waits.
