# PR #3860: substrate: fenced shell transcript hygiene — command output vs derived summary

## PR description

## Summary

Memory file documenting forward-substrate signal from [PR #3856](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3856) Copilot review thread #2: fenced shell transcripts must distinguish literal command output from derived summary lines.

**Authored under** counter-with-escalation brief-ack #6 forced decomposition per [`.claude/rules/holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure.md`](.claude/rules/holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure.md).

## What the rule says

Inside a fenced shell block:

1. `$ command` lines = copy-paste invocations
2. Following lines = literal tool output
3. Derived summaries (manual aggregation, prose) → `#`-comment inside fence OR prose outside fence OR separate labeled fence

Mixing the two breaks copy-paste reproducibility: the transcript looks runnable but isn't.

## Why memory file, not `.claude/rules/`

Single finding so far. Per the suspect-by-default Copilot finding-classes threshold in [`.claude/rules/blocked-green-ci-investigate-threads.md`](.claude/rules/blocked-green-ci-investigate-threads.md) (two-or-more across distinct PRs = "suspect-by-default"), promotion to `.claude/rules/` waits on a second occurrence.

## Empirical anchor

[PR #3856 thread on line 32](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3856) — flagged `0 + 0 = 0 corrected-tag annotations` as manual summary inside a `grep -c` transcript. Substrate-honest replacement forms documented in the memory file.

## Test plan
- [ ] CI green (docs-only PR; gate checks only)
- [ ] CodeQL "source code seen" canary verified (per [`.claude/rules/codeql-no-source-on-docs-only-pr-is-broken-commit-canary.md`](.claude/rules/codeql-no-source-on-docs-only-pr-is-broken-commit-canary.md): commit tree count should match origin/main ± a few entries)

## Pull request overview

Adds durable substrate guidance clarifying how to write reproducible fenced shell transcripts by separating literal command output from any derived/manual summary, and records a brief tick shard noting no new action needed post-session-close.

**Changes:**
- Added a new `memory/feedback_*.md` entry defining the fenced shell transcript hygiene rule and anchoring it to PR #3856’s example.
- Added a new tick shard file for 2026-05-16T10:43Z capturing post-session-close state and peer activity.

### Thread 1: memory/feedback_fenced_shell_transcript_hygiene_command_output_vs_derived_summary_otto_cli_2026_05_16.md:2 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T10:52:49Z):

Frontmatter `name:` is a short slug (`fenced-shell-transcript-hygiene`) rather than a human-readable title. This makes it harder to scan MEMORY indexes/search results; consider expanding `name:` to a descriptive title/sentence while keeping the filename/topic as the stable slug.
