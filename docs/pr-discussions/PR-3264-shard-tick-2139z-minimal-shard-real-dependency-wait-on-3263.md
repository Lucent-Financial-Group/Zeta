# PR #3264: shard(tick): 2139Z — minimal shard; real-dependency-wait on #3263 (no actionable findings)

## PR description

## Summary

Tick 2026-05-14T21:39Z minimal shard. Per the [2001Z precedent](docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/2001Z.md): when CI-wait is real + bounded + no actionable atom exists from audit sweep, the substrate-honest tick output IS the shard itself.

## Audit sweep (no clean atom surfaced)

| Audit | Findings | Atom for this tick? |
|---|---|---|
| `audit-backlog-items` (depends_on / composes_with / duplicate-IDs) | 0 / 0 / 0 | n/a |
| `audit-memory-index-duplicates` | 0 | n/a |
| `audit-rule-cross-refs` | 39 candidates | requires 9-variant taxonomy — not single-tick |
| `audit-machine-specific-content` | 46 findings | mostly doc-context inside code-blocks |
| `audit-orphan-role-refs` | many | mostly archive surfaces |

## Pattern codified: minimal-shard at natural rest vs Standing-by-failure

| Aspect | Standing-by-failure | Minimal-shard at rest |
|---|---|---|
| Real-dependency named? | No | Yes (PR #3263 CI wait) |
| Bounded? | No | Yes (CI clears in minutes) |
| Audit sweep done? | No | Yes — no clean atom |
| Tick output | "Holding" string | Substantive shard documenting state + audit-sweep table |

Future-Otto in same state: run sweep → write shard → don't force substantive PR.

## Prior-tick

[#3258](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3258) (shard 2128Z + tally/glob fix) merged as `82ac778`.

## Session running tally

25 merged + 1 wait-ci (#3263) + this shard's PR.

## Test plan

- [x] Composite branch-guard
- [x] `markdownlint-cli2` + `audit-md032-plus-linestart` clean
- [x] `gh pr create --head` explicit ref
- [ ] CI clears
- [ ] Auto-merge

## Pull request overview

Adds the 2026-05-14T21:39Z hygiene-history tick shard documenting a bounded real-dependency wait on PR #3263 and recording that an audit sweep did not surface a clean single-tick “atom” to pursue.

**Changes:**
- Adds a new tick shard file for 2139Z capturing refresh/hold/audit/verify/visibility notes.
- Records the audit sweep results and the “minimal-shard at rest” vs “standing-by-failure” comparison table.

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/2139Z.md:13 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T21:45:46Z):

P1 (xref): These markdown links to `.claude/rules/...` are relative to the tick file’s directory, so they resolve to `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/.claude/...` and will 404. Use root-relative links (e.g., `/.claude/rules/...`) or follow the surrounding tick convention of referencing rule files in backticks without a link.

This issue also appears in the following locations of the same file:
- line 30
- line 39

**@AceHack** (2026-05-14T21:48:46Z):

Substantive catch — confirmed. Post-merge cleanup landed via PR #3269: replaced 3 broken relative links with plain backtick paths (matching established shard-authoring convention).
