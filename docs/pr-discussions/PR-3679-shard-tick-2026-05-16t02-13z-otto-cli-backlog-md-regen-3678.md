**Changes:**
- Adds a new `0213Z.md` tick log.
- Records PR #3678 as the BACKLOG.md regeneration cleanup.

* This relative link goes up to `docs/` and then appends `docs/backlog/...`, so it resolves as `docs/docs/backlog/...` instead of the existing B-0545 row. From this tick directory, the link should target the `backlog/` subtree under `docs/`, not a nested `docs/` directory.

* This relative link only climbs to `docs/`, so it resolves under `docs/.claude/rules/...`; the existing rule file is at the repository root under `.claude/rules/...`. The link needs one more `..` segment or another root-relative form to avoid landing broken.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/0213Z.md:4 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T02:19:09Z):

This parent-tick link points to `0210Z.md`, but that file is not present under `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/` in this branch. Unless this PR is strictly merged after the shard that adds that file and then rebased, the new history page lands with a broken cross-reference.

This issue also appears in the following locations of the same file:
- line 28
- line 35
