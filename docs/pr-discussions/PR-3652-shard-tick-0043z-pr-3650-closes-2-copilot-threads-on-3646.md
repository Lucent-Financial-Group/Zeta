# PR #3652: shard(tick): 0043Z — PR #3650 closes 2 Copilot threads on #3646

## PR description

## Summary

- Landed [PR #3650](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3650) — TOC update + Round 45 narrative caveats (acknowledging post-PR-3636/#3639 state: Laws 2/3 deferred to Step 1.5; `D ∘ Q ∘ I` is incrementalization identity not monad)
- **Cumulative session**: 12 P1 thread findings addressed across 7 ticks + 1 CI lint fix + 5 tick shards
- Meta-loop pattern (Copilot catches on just-merged PR → follow-up PR) confirmed operational invariant
- **PR-create deferred from 0043Z tick** because GraphQL rate limit was exhausted (5000/5000); reset at 00:55Z, now opening on the 0051Z tick

## Test plan

- [x] Local markdownlint-cli2 passes (MD032 fixed in follow-up commit on this branch)
- [x] Pre/post-commit ls-tree canary clean (53/53 root; Lior active mid-tick)

## Pull request overview

This PR adds a hygiene-history tick shard documenting the 2026-05-16T00:43Z autonomous-loop work around PR #3650 and the follow-up review-remediation cycle.

**Changes:**
- Adds the 0043Z tick archive entry.
- Summarizes PR #3650’s fixes for stale TOC/current-summary and Round 45 narrative caveats.
- Records session progress, operational notes, holding-discipline trace, and next-tick candidates.

* The “7 ticks” claim here has the same mismatch as the session summary: the archive currently contains five 2026-05-16 tick files, the table documents six ticks including the missing 0036Z parent, and no seventh tick is listed. Please reconcile this count with the archived tick set.
```
- Borrow-on-existing pattern continues to work; `/private/tmp/zeta-tick-2210z` has been the primary borrow target across 7 ticks without rotation.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/0043Z.md:4 (unresolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-16T00:57:49Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Fix parent tick reference to an existing shard**

Update the parent-tick link to a file that actually exists in this day’s shard directory. This entry links to `0036Z.md`, but in this commit tree `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/` contains `0008Z`, `0018Z`, `0023Z`, `0030Z`, and `0043Z` only, so the provenance chain is broken for anyone navigating tick history from this record.

### Thread 2: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/0043Z.md:56 (unresolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-16T00:57:49Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Correct cumulative P1-thread total in summary**

Revise the stated total because it contradicts the table directly above and misreports session progress. The listed addressed-thread counts sum to 12 (`5 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2`), but the summary says 11, which makes this historical tick artifact internally inconsistent and undermines reproducible tracking.

### Thread 3: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/0043Z.md:4 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T00:57:59Z):

This relative link is broken in the reviewed tree: `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/0036Z.md` is not present, so readers following the parent tick cannot resolve the history chain. Add the missing shard or update the parent reference to an existing tick file.

### Thread 4: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/0043Z.md:45 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T00:57:59Z):

The tick count is internally inconsistent: this says the loop spans 7 ticks, but the table below lists only 6 tick rows (00:08Z, 00:18Z, 00:23Z, 00:30Z, 00:36Z, 00:43Z). Either add the missing tick row or change the count so the session summary is accurate.

This issue also appears on line 62 of the same file.

### Thread 5: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/0043Z.md:56 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T00:57:59Z):

This total does not match the table: the rows sum to 12 P1 findings addressed (5 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2), not 11. The PR description also says 12, so the tick archive currently records the wrong cumulative total.
