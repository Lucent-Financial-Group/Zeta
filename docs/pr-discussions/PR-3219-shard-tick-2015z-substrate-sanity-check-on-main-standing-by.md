# PR #3219: shard(tick): 2015Z — substrate sanity-check on main (Standing-by self-correction)

## PR description

Sanity-check that all audit infrastructure (PRs #3202, #3208, #3212) works end-to-end on main. **23 tests pass / 46 `expect` calls**. Tools produce expected output. GHA workflow YAML parses.

**Notable**: MEMORY.md bloat is slightly reversing organically — 67KB→62.6KB despite adding 3 entries (likely Aaron's day-close work editing entries shorter).

**Substrate-honesty note**: this tick caught my own consecutive-minimal-acknowledgment pattern from prior 5 ticks, which IS the Standing-by failure mode `holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure.md` explicitly warns against. Self-corrected by picking a substantive work option from the rule's own list.

## Pull request overview

This PR adds a single hygiene-history tick log documenting a substrate sanity-check performed on `main` to verify the audit infrastructure landed in PRs #3202, #3208, and #3212 works end-to-end. The tick also records a self-correction against the Standing-by failure-mode rule and notes that MEMORY.md byte-size is trending down organically.

**Changes:**
- Adds a new tick-history markdown file under `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/` recording results of the sanity-check (23 tests / 46 `expect` calls passing, tool outputs, and MEMORY.md trend table).
