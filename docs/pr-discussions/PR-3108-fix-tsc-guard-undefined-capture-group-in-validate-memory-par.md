# PR #3108: fix(tsc): guard undefined capture group in validate-memory-parity

## PR description

## Summary

- TypeScript 6.0 types `RegExpMatchArray` capture groups as `string | undefined` — even non-optional groups like ours — causing five `TS18048`/`TS2345` errors in `tools/memory/validate-memory-parity.ts`
- Adds a two-line guard (`const captured = m[1]; if (captured === undefined) continue;`) that narrows the type to `string`, fixes all five errors, and eliminates the `lint (tsc tools)` failure on every future CI run
- No functional change: the regex's single capture group will never actually be `undefined`, so the guard is only type-level

## Test plan

- [x] `bun --bun tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json` exits 0 locally
- [ ] `lint (tsc tools)` CI check passes green

## Pull request overview

This PR fixes TypeScript 6.0 strict typing in `validate-memory-parity` by narrowing a regex capture group before using it as a string.

**Changes:**
- Adds an explicit `undefined` guard for `m[1]`.
- Preserves existing runtime behavior while satisfying stricter `RegExpMatchArray` typing.
