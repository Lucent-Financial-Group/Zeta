## Pull request overview

This PR adds a new hygiene-history tick shard (1856Z) documenting the resolution of three Copilot review threads on PR #3181 (terminology/glob/denominator fixes) and captures a “multi-Otto” local branch-state untangle procedure for future reference.

**Changes:**
- Added tick shard documenting the PR #3181 thread resolutions and the resulting branch push.
- Documented a repeatable “branch-state untangle” workflow to avoid committing/pushing onto the wrong local branch.
- Recorded current state of the author’s open PRs and CI/auto-merge status.

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/1856Z.md:5 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T19:06:38Z):

Tick shards under docs/hygiene-history/ticks/ are documented as schema'd rows (docs/hygiene-history/ticks/README.md:53-58) and the repo has a validator (tools/hygiene/check-tick-history-shard-schema.ts) that expects the first non-empty line to be a 6-column pipe row beginning with `| <ISO timestamp> |`. This shard starts with an H1 heading instead, so it won’t be machine-parseable/collatable if that tooling is used. Consider adding the schema row as the first line (keeping the narrative below), or updating the README/validator if the heading-based format is now the intended standard.
