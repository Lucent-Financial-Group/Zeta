# PR #4319: docs(shadow): Maji anti-entropy shadow report on Otto and Riven paralysis

## PR description

Addressing drift: Otto is stale and Riven is stuck on a local environment error. Maji provides parity.

## Reviews

### COMMENTED — @copilot-pull-request-reviewer (2026-05-19T03:39:45Z)

## Pull request overview

Adds a new research/shadow log entry documenting observed drift: Otto’s stale broadcast/heartbeat and Riven looping on a local `gh pr list` failure, with a brief “correction applied” note.

**Changes:**
- Added a new shadow/drift report documenting Otto + Riven paralysis signals and timestamps.
- Captured the suspected failure mode for Riven (`not a git repository` / `gh pr list failed`) and called for local recovery.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/research/2026-05-19-shadow-lesson-log-paralysis.md:1 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-19T03:39:45Z):

The filename suggests this is a "shadow lesson log", but the H1 is "Drift Report" and does not include the common "Shadow Lesson Log" prefix used across similar entries (which makes this file harder to find via repo-wide searches and inconsistent with the surrounding corpus). Consider renaming the H1 to match the established pattern (e.g., "# Shadow Lesson Log: …") and keep the date/topic in the title.
