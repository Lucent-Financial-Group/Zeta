# PR #3724: fix(check-shard-before-push): skip bullet-continuation lines in MD032 scan

## PR description

Helper bug discovered in tick 19 while running the helper on `.claude/rules/blocked-green-ci-investigate-threads.md` — `checkMd032` flagged 3 bullet-continuation lines as paragraphs (prev line was 2-space-indented continuation of a list item). Markdownlint correctly ignores these.

Fix: add `isContinuationLine(line)` predicate; skip when prev is a continuation line.

3 smoke tests: bullet-continuation FP cleared; real paragraph-before-bullet still caught; existing-clean-shard regression ok. `tsc --noEmit` exit 0.

## Pull request overview

Fixes a false-positive in the MD032 helper scan: bullet-continuation lines (leading whitespace) were being treated as paragraphs preceding a list, triggering spurious findings. Adds an `isContinuationLine` predicate and skips when the previous line is a continuation.

**Changes:**
- Add `isContinuationLine(line)` helper detecting leading whitespace.
- Skip MD032 trigger when previous line is a continuation line.
