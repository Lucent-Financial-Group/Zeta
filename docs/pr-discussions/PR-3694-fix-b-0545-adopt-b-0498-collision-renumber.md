# PR #3694: fix(b-0545): adopt B-0498 collision renumber

## PR description

## Summary

- adopts the existing Otto B-0498 collision-renumber fix onto current main without rewriting Otto's branch
- renumbers the Riven cursor-terminal backlog row to B-0549 and preserves breadcrumbs
- regenerates docs/BACKLOG.md so the generated index matches the row rename

## Verification

- git diff --check
- bun tools/hygiene/audit-backlog-items.ts --enforce-duplicate-ids
- bun tools/backlog/generate-index.ts --check

## Coordination

This unblocks PR #3674's factory-wide duplicate-ID gate once merged.

## Pull request overview

Adopts the existing duplicate backlog ID collision fix by renumbering the Riven cursor-terminal backlog row from **B-0498 → B-0549**, updating cross-references, and regenerating the generated backlog index so it matches the per-row files.

**Changes:**
- Updated the Riven cursor-terminal research design doc to reference **B-0549** (with renumber breadcrumb).
- Updated backlog row files to reflect the renumber (frontmatter + breadcrumbs) and updated the collision-sweep row to point at the new ID.
- Regenerated `docs/BACKLOG.md` to drop the old B-0498 entry and add B-0549.

* Per `tools/backlog/README.md` the `last_updated` frontmatter field is required and must be updated on every content edit. This row's frontmatter is missing `last_updated` entirely; add it (likely `2026-05-16` given this edit).

* This new “Resolution” section states the renumber target is B-0549, but earlier in the same document the “Next free ID” / “Sweep scope” sections still describe renumbering to B-0546. Please update those earlier sections (or explicitly label them as historical/estimates) to avoid leaving contradictory guidance in a single row file.

## Resolution (2026-05-16)

Renumber executed in this same PR:

- Renamed `docs/backlog/P1/B-0498-riven-cursor-terminal-*-2026-05-15.md` → `docs/backlog/P1/B-0549-riven-cursor-terminal-*-2026-05-15.md`

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/backlog/P2/B-0545-b0498-collision-renumber-sweep-2026-05-15.md:6 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T02:55:55Z):

`status: done` is not a valid backlog-row status (schema allows `open`/`closed`/`superseded-by-*`/`deferred`/`decomposed`). It will also render as unchecked in the generated `docs/BACKLOG.md` because the generator only treats `closed`/`superseded-by-*` as closed. Use `status: closed` here if the intention is to mark B-0545 complete.

This issue also appears in the following locations of the same file:
- line 6
- line 92
