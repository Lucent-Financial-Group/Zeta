# PR #3281: shard(tick): 2204Z — PR #3276 double-backtick fix + Aaron off-duty signal observed

## PR description

## Summary

Tick 2026-05-14T22:04Z shard. Two pieces:

1. **Audit fix**: PR [#3276](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3276) Copilot caught a broken single-backtick code span; fix `a3dd133` wraps in double-backticks per the 2154Z inline-code-span discipline. Thread resolved.

2. **Aaron off-duty signal observed** via parallel-Otto branch contamination: commit `0a9a2e2` on `shard/2026-05-14-shadow-session-close-off-duty-aaron-signaled` reads `"off-duty until next signal (shadow*)"`.

## Response to off-duty signal

Per `.claude/rules/mechanical-authorization-check.md` (Aaron is the only authorization source), future ticks should:

- **Land in-flight work** (this tick + #3276 audit fix)
- **Not start new substantive PRs**
- **Continue per-tick discipline** with minimal shards (cron still fires every minute per `tick-must-never-stop`)
- **Wait for next signal** from Aaron

## Meta-pattern

Third reproduction this session of the inline-code-span class. Pre-push lint caught the bug AGAIN in THIS very shard while I was describing it (single-backtick code span with `](`). Fixed with fenced `text` block. The audit-discipline-mechanization gap is real and **load-bearing for next session, not this one**.

## Prior-tick

[#3277](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3277) (shard 2202Z) → `dcd8475`.

## Session running tally: 34 merged + 1 wait-ci (#3276) + this shard's PR

## Test plan

- [x] Thread on #3276 resolved
- [x] `markdownlint-cli2` + `audit-md032-plus-linestart` clean
- [x] Composite branch-guard caught + recovered from contamination (also surfaced the off-duty signal as collateral benefit)
- [ ] CI clears
- [ ] Auto-merge

## Pull request overview

Adds the 2026-05-14 22:04Z tick shard to the hygiene-history log, capturing (a) the Copilot-found inline-code rendering issue from PR #3276 and its resolution, and (b) an observed off-duty signal surfaced during branch-contamination recovery.

**Changes:**
- Introduces a new tick shard documenting the #3276 inline-code-span (backtick) rendering fix and verification steps.
- Records an observed authorization-source “off-duty” signal and the resulting minimal-tick discipline guidance.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/2204Z.md:15 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T22:12:21Z):

P1 (xref): This references `2158Z.md` directly, but there is no `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/2158Z.md` in the repo (it appears to only exist on PR #3276’s branch). To keep the shard self-consistent when read from `main`, refer to the PR (#3276) and/or the tick time (“the 2158Z shard in PR #3276”) instead of a filename that isn’t present.

### Thread 2: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/2204Z.md:35 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T22:12:22Z):

P1 (rendering): The quoted “double-backticks” example appears to have ambiguous/unbalanced backtick delimiters (e.g., `` ``content with ... backticks`` ``), which risks reintroducing the same inline-code rendering breakage this shard is documenting. Consider copying the exact table row from tick 2154Z verbatim, or move the example into a fenced `text` block so the backticks are displayed literally.
