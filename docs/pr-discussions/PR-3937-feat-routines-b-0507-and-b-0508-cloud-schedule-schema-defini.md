# PR #3937: feat(routines): B-0507 and B-0508 cloud-schedule schema definition

## PR description

Delivers slice 1 and 2 of B-0448 (Cloud Routines).
- B-0507: Added research doc on cloud routines API, auth, and triggers.
- B-0508: Added cloud-schedule.schema.json, updated install.ts with types, and updated tools/routines/README.md.

## Pull request overview

Lands slices 1 and 2 of B-0448 (Cloud Routines): a research doc capturing the Anthropic Cloud Routines API/auth/trigger surface, plus a schema and TypeScript types laying the groundwork for `cloud-schedule.json` files alongside the existing Desktop `schedule.json`.

**Changes:**
- Adds `tools/routines/cloud-schedule.schema.json` (taskId + trigger oneOf: scheduled/github_event/api, plus repos/connectors/notes).
- Exports `CloudTrigger` and `CloudScheduleResult` types from `tools/routines/install.ts` (no reader/consumer wired yet).
- Adds research doc and closes B-0507/B-0508 backlog rows; updates `tools/routines/README.md` to document `cloud-schedule.json`.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/research/2026-05-14-cloud-routines-api-auth-registration-surface-b0507.md:1 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T20:29:28Z):

This authored research doc uses a date-prefixed filename (`2026-05-14-...md`), which matches the markdownlint ignore pattern `docs/research/2026-*-*.md`. Per `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc:90-112`, that pattern is reserved for verbatim courier-protocol ferry absorbs whose lint violations are tolerated because reformatting would break verbatim preservation. This file is authored content (not a verbatim ferry absorb) and will silently skip lint coverage. Consider renaming to a non-date-prefix form (e.g., `cloud-routines-api-auth-registration-surface-b0507.md`) so the doc receives lint coverage.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-16T20:39:36Z):

Resolving no-op per markdownlint B-0078 policy. `docs/research/2026-*-*.md` is intentionally broad per `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc:85-114`: a 2026-05-10 narrowing attempt was empirically wrong (CI revealed 82+ legitimate verbatim-ferry date-prefixed files). Theoretical concern about authored-content silently skipping lint is acknowledged in the policy comment and explicitly accepted as the cost of verbatim-preservation. This authored research doc lands under the broad pattern by design, not by accident.

### Thread 2: tools/routines/cloud-schedule.schema.json:62 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T20:29:28Z):

The schema declares `repos` at two levels: once at the top level (line 56-62, "List of repositories accessible to the routine environment") and once inside the `github_event` trigger branch (line 36-42, "List of GitHub repositories to attach the trigger to"). These two `repos` arrays have different semantics but identical shape and name, which will be confusing to authors of `cloud-schedule.json` — it is unclear when both must be set, whether they must agree, and how a `scheduled` or `api` trigger interacts with top-level `repos`. Consider renaming one (e.g., top-level → `repoAccess` or `availableRepos`, or trigger-level → `triggerRepos`) or removing the duplication if the top-level field is intended to cover the trigger case.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-16T20:39:37Z):

Addressed in 0cbe4e0 via description disambiguation rather than rename. Trigger-scope `trigger.repos` (github_event webhook sources) and runtime-scope top-level `repos` (environment repo-access ACL) now spell out the distinction in their descriptions. Rename was the cleaner long-term choice but would have churned a freshly-authored schema for clarity that documentation supplies more cheaply.

### Thread 3: tools/routines/cloud-schedule.schema.json:11 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T20:29:28Z):

The schema's top-level `taskId` is `required`, but the exported `CloudScheduleResult` / `CloudTrigger` types do not surface it, and the research doc (lines 38-41) notes the schema should model "trigger" but does not mention a required `taskId`. Authors will hit a validation failure if they omit it, while the directory name already provides the same identity (`syncRoutine` derives taskId from the directory at install.ts:131). Either drop the `required` constraint on `taskId` (make it optional/derived) or document explicitly in the README that `cloud-schedule.json` must duplicate the directory name in `taskId`.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-16T20:39:38Z):

Addressed in 0cbe4e0. Relaxed `taskId` from required to optional and expanded the field description to name the containing directory as authoritative (install.ts:131 derives canonical taskId from `repoRoutinesDir/<id>`). The field is preserved for self-documentation and for cloud-side tooling that consumes `cloud-schedule.json` without filesystem layout (per the install.ts comment header). `CloudScheduleResult` deliberately omits taskId for the same reason.
