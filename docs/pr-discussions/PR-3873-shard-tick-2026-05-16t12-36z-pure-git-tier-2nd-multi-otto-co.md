# PR #3873: shard(tick): 2026-05-16T12:36Z — pure-git tier; 2nd multi-Otto contamination in 3 ticks

## PR description

Deferred-PR landing under pure-git tier discipline (branch pushed when GraphQL=0).

## Shard

[`docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/1236Z.md`](../hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/1236Z.md) — 2nd multi-Otto contamination observation of this session. HEAD bounced back to the PR #3871 branch under peer-Otto's `fix_branch` shell function (PID 75933 observed at 12:21Z firing `git switch <branch>` against the shared `.git/`).

## Pattern stable

| Tick | HEAD at tick start |
|---|---|
| 12:11Z | `otto-cli-b0206-audit-2026-05-16-1207z` (own) |
| 12:21Z | `otto-cli-b0037.2-audit-2026-05-16-1131z` (peer MD018 branch) |
| 12:36Z | `otto-cli-b0206-audit-2026-05-16-1207z` (bounced back) |

Defense pattern (`git branch --show-current` + `git switch -c <fresh> origin/main`) 100% effective. B-0519 RCA confirmed at high cadence.

## Pull request overview

Adds a hygiene-history tick shard recording the 2026-05-16T12:36Z autonomous-loop observation and the pure-git operating tier under GraphQL exhaustion.

**Changes:**
- Documents the second multi-Otto HEAD-contamination observation in three ticks.
- Records the pure-git tier decision, deferred PR backlog, sentinel status, and visibility signals.
- Links the branch-push counter rationale to the existing refresh-world-model poll PR gate rule.
