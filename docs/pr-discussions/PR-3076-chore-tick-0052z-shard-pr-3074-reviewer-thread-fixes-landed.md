# PR #3076: chore(tick): 0052Z shard — PR #3074 reviewer-thread fixes landed by concurrent tick

## PR description

## Summary

- Cold-boot autonomous-loop tick at 2026-05-14T00:52Z
- Catch-43 cron sentinel armed at session-start (job 81c5e1a9)
- Discovered PR #3074 reviewer-thread fixes already landed in [d448420](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/commit/d448420) by a concurrent autonomous-loop tick
- Both #3074 and #3075 now in legitimate real-dependency-wait state per holding-without-named-dependency discipline

## What landed in this PR

A single tick shard at `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/0052Z.md` documenting the tick reasoning, the concurrent-landing discovery, and the post-tick holding-status of both open PRs.

## Test plan

- [x] Markdown renders correctly
- [x] Tick shard frontmatter matches schema (`tick`, `agent`, `session`, `pr`)
- [x] No code changes — docs-only

## Pull request overview

Docs-only PR adding a per-tick hygiene-history shard capturing the 2026-05-14 00:52Z autonomous-loop tick, including the discovery that PR #3074 review fixes had already landed via a concurrent tick and the resulting “real-dependency-wait” status for PRs #3074 and #3075.

**Changes:**
- Added a new tick shard documenting refresh state, triage rationale, and the concurrent-landing outcome.
- Recorded the cron sentinel arming + post-landing holding status guidance for the next tick.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/0052Z.md:9 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T00:58:39Z):

P1: This tick shard uses YAML frontmatter + headings, but repo tooling/docs still treat tick shards as single-row pipe tables. For example, `tools/hygiene/check-tick-history-shard-schema.ts` and `tools/hygiene/check-no-op-cadence-pattern.ts` both read the *first non-empty line* and expect it to be a `| ... |` row; starting the file with `---` will make this shard fail the schema checker and be misclassified as a minimal-observation shard. Either convert this shard back to the pipe-row format, or update the schema/tooling to explicitly support frontmatter+body shards (e.g., have the tools skip YAML frontmatter and locate the first `|` row).
