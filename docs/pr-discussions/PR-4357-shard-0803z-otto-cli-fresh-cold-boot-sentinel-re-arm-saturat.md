# PR #4357: shard(0803Z): Otto-CLI fresh cold-boot — sentinel re-arm + saturation snapshot

## PR description

## Summary

- Fresh autonomous-loop tick at 0803Z; sentinel was missing post prior-session-crash retirement; new sentinel `02c996c5` armed FIRST per `.claude/rules/tick-must-never-stop.md`
- Cost-aware GraphQL tier (1355 remaining); 17 peer agent procs; primary worktree contested with 20+ M files from yesterday's branch — isolated worktree at `/private/tmp/zeta-otto-cli-cold-boot-0803z` used per `zeta-expected-branch.md` race-window-caveat
- ls-tree count 53 verified pre-commit + post-commit (no canary corruption per `codeql-no-source-on-docs-only-pr-is-broken-commit-canary.md`)
- Concrete-artifact tick shard at `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/19/0803Z.md` — fills the ~2h gap since last 05-19 shard (`0608Z.md` = PR #4343 cold-boot session arc)

## Test plan
- [x] ls-tree HEAD = 53 (origin/main 3aa6d969 was 53 → no tree loss)
- [x] branch-show-current guard passed pre-commit
- [x] Sentinel `02c996c5` armed at session start; verified via `CronList`
- [x] No `.git/` mutations in primary contested worktree

## Pull request overview

A history-surface tick shard documenting a fresh Otto-CLI cold-boot at 0803Z on 2026-05-19, capturing sentinel re-arm and saturation snapshot. Adds a single new file under `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/` to fill the ~2h gap since the prior shard.

**Changes:**
- New tick shard recording cold-boot context, refresh signals, and 7-step loop outcome
- Documents sentinel `02c996c5` re-arm after prior `2fe26db3` expired
- Records 17-peer saturation + isolated-worktree decision
