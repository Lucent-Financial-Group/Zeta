# PR #4039: fix(ci): unblock inherited #4028 lint failures

## PR description

Unblocks inherited CI failures currently visible on #4028, without widening #4028's tally-fix scope.

What changed:
- Fix `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/17/0221Z.md` .claude/rules relative links from 5-up to 6-up so they resolve to repo root.
- Update `tools/inventory/amazon-orders-extract.ts` to use a typed runtime-only Playwright import loader and strict `dedup` fallback for `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`.

Verification:
- `/opt/homebrew/bin/bun tools/hygiene/audit-tick-shard-relative-paths.ts --enforce --baseline tools/hygiene/audit-tick-shard-relative-paths.baseline.json`
- `/opt/homebrew/bin/bun install --frozen-lockfile`
- `/opt/homebrew/bin/bun --bun tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`

## Pull request overview

This PR unblocks inherited CI failures by correcting tick-shard cross-references and making the Amazon orders extractor compatible with strict TypeScript checks.

**Changes:**
- Fixes `.claude/rules` relative links in a hygiene tick shard.
- Adds a typed runtime-only Playwright loader to avoid static module-resolution failures.
- Narrows unchecked array access in the extractor’s URL dedup logic.
