# PR #3639: fix(pr-3636): 3 Copilot P1 threads — closure-operator precision + last_updated bump

## PR description

## Summary

Addresses 3 unresolved P1 Copilot threads on now-merged [PR #3636](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3636):

**Threads 2 + 3** (research doc + memory file): the phrase "observer-relative non-monotonicity" introduced in PR #3636's Step 1.5 substrate contradicts the doc's own line 85 disclaimer that the non-classical move is observer-context shift, NOT non-monotonicity within a single context. The precise obstruction (correctly identified by the reviewer) is that `A` is **not a closure operator** — `p ≤ A(p)` is not assumed. Both files reworded to name the closure-operator failure as the obstruction, with an explicit note distinguishing it from non-monotonicity-within-a-context.

**Thread 1** (B-0544 backlog row): `last_updated` frontmatter was not bumped on PR #3636's content edit. Schema violation per `tools/backlog/README.md:57-70`. Bumped to `2026-05-16`.

**Preemptive (not flagged but same class)**: B-0543 also had a content edit in [PR #3626](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3626) without a `last_updated` bump. Same schema violation; bumped preemptively.

## Pull request overview

This PR resolves three previously-raised P1 review threads by tightening the mathematical phrasing around why a Lawvere–Tierney-style lifting is obstructed (closure-operator failure, not “non-monotonicity within a context”) and by bringing backlog row frontmatter back into schema compliance via `last_updated` bumps.

**Changes:**
- Rewords Step 1.5 text in the research doc and its paired memory note to correctly attribute the obstruction to `A` not being a closure operator (`p ≤ A(p)` not assumed), explicitly distinguishing this from within-context monotonicity (finite-limit preservation) and from observer-context shifts.
- Bumps `last_updated` on B-0544 to reflect a prior content edit, per backlog schema.
- Preemptively bumps `last_updated` on B-0543 for the same schema-violation class.
