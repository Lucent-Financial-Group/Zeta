# PR #3678: fix(hygiene): regen docs/BACKLOG.md index — clear generated-index drift

## PR description

Mechanical regen via \`BACKLOG_WRITE_FORCE=1 bun tools/backlog/generate-index.ts\`.

## What

- Re-ran the BACKLOG.md generator from per-row source files
- `bun tools/backlog/generate-index.ts --check` now exit 0 (was exit 2)
- Diff: +16 / -1 — new rows (B-0543–B-0548 + a few others) now reflected in the index

## Why

Second of three drift cleanups deferred from [tick 0111Z](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/blob/main/docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/0111Z.md) — the `check docs/BACKLOG.md generated-index drift` non-required CI check has been firing FAILURE on every PR this session.

After this PR merges, the check will flip fail → pass on subsequent PRs.

## Remaining drift (next-tick candidates)

- `lint (backlog ID uniqueness)` — B-0498 collision per [B-0545](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/blob/main/docs/backlog/P2/B-0545-b0498-collision-renumber-sweep-2026-05-15.md)
- `lint (tsc tools)` — pending investigation

## Provenance

- Authored via borrow-on-existing pattern on sibling worktree `/private/tmp/zeta-tick-2210z` (Lior still active in `ps -A` — new worktree-add unsafe per [broken-commit canary rule](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/blob/main/.claude/rules/codeql-no-source-on-docs-only-pr-is-broken-commit-canary.md))
- Tree integrity verified pre/post commit: 53/53 top-level entries (matches origin/main exactly)

## Pull request overview

Mechanical regeneration of `docs/BACKLOG.md` from per-row backlog files to clear generated-index drift.

**Changes:**
- Adds recently filed P1/P2/P3 backlog rows to the generated index.
- Updates B-0500 from open to closed in the index.
- Leaves the known B-0498 duplicate-ID drift visible in the regenerated output.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/BACKLOG.md:305 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T02:18:28Z):

This adds a second `B-0498` entry to the generated index while `docs/BACKLOG.md` still has the existing P2 `B-0498` entry at line 582. `tools/backlog/README.md:61` requires backlog IDs to be factory-wide unique, and `.github/workflows/gate.yml:767-791` runs the duplicate-ID lint, so merging this regenerated index still leaves readers and CI with an ambiguous `B-0498` reference.
