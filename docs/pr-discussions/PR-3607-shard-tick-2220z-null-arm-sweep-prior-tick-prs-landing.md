# PR #3607: shard(tick): 2220Z — null arm-sweep; prior-tick PRs landing

## PR description

## Summary

- Null arm-sweep this tick: only #3604 (2217Z shard) armed in non-DIRTY set; 3 other reports are `fix-failed-checks` with unresolved threads (out of autonomous scope).
- Prior-tick carry: **#3602** + **#3603** MERGED ✓; **#3599** went DIRTY/CONFLICTING (peer-Lior `automation/pr-archive-*` overlap on `docs/pr-discussions/PR-359*.md`) — left for next Lior cycle.
- Lior re-fired between 2217Z and 2220Z (3 processes); borrow-on-existing pattern continues.

## Test plan

- [x] Pre/post-commit tree 52→52
- [x] #3602 + #3603 MERGED confirmed via `gh pr view`
- [x] #3599 CONFLICTING confirmed via `gh pr view --json mergeable`
- [x] Cron `d97cdace` still listed

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/15/2220Z.md:1 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T22:25:05Z):

P1: This shard starts with YAML frontmatter instead of the canonical first-line pipe row. The shard README requires a `| <ISO 8601 UTC timestamp> | ... |` first line, and `check-tick-history-shard-schema.ts` validates the first non-empty line while `check-no-op-cadence-pattern.ts` reads the first line's body column; this file will therefore be schema-invalid and counted as a minimal observation despite the rich body. Add the schema row as the first line (hybrid pattern) or update the tooling/schema in the same PR.

### Thread 2: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/15/2220Z.md:29 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T22:25:05Z):

P1: The cited holding rule requires a specific named dependency *with a bounded ETA* (for CI, a check name and expected minutes), but this dependency list only names PRs and leaves both waits unbounded. As written the shard records the tick as rule-compliant while omitting the rule's key condition, which weakens the liveness evidence this history file is meant to preserve.

### Thread 3: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/15/2220Z.md:21 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T22:25:05Z):

P2: This backticked path pattern is not machine-resolvable: `..` is range prose, not a Markdown link or shell glob, so a reader/tool cannot verify which `docs/pr-discussions/PR-359*` files overlapped. List the concrete filenames or use a valid glob-like description outside backticks to avoid a dead cross-reference.
