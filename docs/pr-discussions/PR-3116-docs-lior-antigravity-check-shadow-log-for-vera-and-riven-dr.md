## Pull request overview

This docs-only PR records an observed drift pattern (narration-over-action / missing auto-healing) and updates backlog hygiene artifacts to mark B-0451 as closed, including corresponding index and tick-history updates.

**Changes:**
- Added a new research shadow-log capturing the Vera/Riven drift observation + correction framing.
- Added a new tick-history shard documenting the session state and B-0451 closure actions.
- Closed backlog row **B-0451** (frontmatter) and updated the generated `docs/BACKLOG.md` checkbox entry.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/0521Z.md:6 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T08:18:09Z):

P1: This new tick shard doesn’t include the YAML frontmatter metadata (e.g., `tick`, `agent`, `session`, `pr`) that’s consistently present in other tick shards in this directory (e.g., `.../0152Z.md`). Please add the frontmatter (and ideally align the H1/header format) so downstream tooling and readers can reliably locate the tick timestamp/PR context.

### Thread 2: docs/backlog/P1/B-0451-duplicate-row-id-substrate-cleanup-2026-05-13.md:93 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T08:18:10Z):

P1: This row is being marked `status: closed`, but the acceptance criteria still contains an unchecked item that explicitly calls for a separate follow-up row (“Wire audit-duplicate-row-ids.ts into a CI workflow…”). Please either (a) file/link that follow-up backlog row here, or (b) move this item out of acceptance criteria (or keep this row open/deferred) so the closed status reflects completed ACs.

### Thread 3: docs/BACKLOG.md:257 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T08:18:10Z):

P2: The PR title/description focus on the Vera/Riven drift shadow-log, but this PR also closes backlog item B-0451 (row frontmatter + regenerated `docs/BACKLOG.md`) and adds a tick shard documenting that closure. Please update the PR description to reflect the full scope (or split into separate PRs) so reviewers/readers don’t miss the backlog-status change.
