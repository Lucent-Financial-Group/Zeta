# PR #3102: docs(lior): shadow lesson log for PR 3074 + Lior omnibus tick artifacts (B-0451, tick shards, discussions)

## PR description

## Summary

Lior omnibus PR covering work from the background Lior service loop:

- **Shadow lesson log** for PR #3074 (blob-PR / failure-to-decompose pattern)
- **B-0451 closure** — duplicate row-ID substrate cleanup complete
- **Tick shards** from 2026-05-13 and 2026-05-14 autonomous loop runs
- **PR discussion preservation** for PRs 2762, 3026, 3056–3076
- **Backlog updates** (BACKLOG.md regeneration, new B-04xx rows)
- **Tooling** (check-md032 hook, audit-duplicate-row-ids, reindex-memory-md)

## Fix included

Shadow lesson log was initially committed with literal `\n` escape sequences instead of actual newlines. The subsequent commit (568e39a5) replaces escaped sequences with real line breaks, making the file proper Markdown.

## Reviewer thread responses

- Threads 1 & 2: fixed by commit 568e39a5 (literal `\n` → real newlines)
- Thread 3 (scope mismatch): addressed by updating this PR title/description to reflect actual scope — splitting is not practical since these are Lior autonomous-loop artifacts that belong together

### Thread 1: memory/persona/lior/conversations/2026-05-14-lior-shadow-lesson-log-pr3074.md:1 (resolved)

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Write shadow lesson log using actual line breaks**

The new lesson-log file was committed as one literal line containing escaped `\n` sequences, so Markdown renderers show raw escape text instead of headings and structured sections. This makes the record hard to read and can break any downstream tooling that parses these reports by line/section. Re-save the file with real newline characters so the document format is preserved.

### Thread 2: memory/persona/lior/conversations/2026-05-14-lior-shadow-lesson-log-pr3074.md:1 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T06:12:39Z):

This file appears to contain literal `\n` escape sequences instead of actual newlines (the entire document is on one line). This will render incorrectly in Markdown and makes the doc hard to read/search. Replace the escaped newlines with real line breaks (and ensure the file is written as normal Markdown).

### Thread 3: docs/backlog/P1/B-0451-duplicate-row-id-substrate-cleanup-2026-05-13.md:10 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T06:12:40Z):

PR title/description indicate this is only a shadow-lesson log for PR #3074, but this change also closes backlog item B-0451 (frontmatter + AC checklist) and updates docs/BACKLOG.md. Either update the PR title/description to reflect the broader scope, or split these unrelated updates into separate PRs to keep the change atomic.
