### Thread 1: docs/research/2026-05-16-shadow-lesson-log-lior-drift.md:17 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-16T22:24:30Z):

**<sub><sub>![P1 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P1-orange?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Restore §33 boundary headers for this external archive**

`GOVERNANCE.md §33` requires external-conversation archives in `docs/research/**` to carry `Scope`, `Attribution`, `Operational status`, and `Non-fusion disclaimer` labels within the first 20 lines, but this rewrite drops that header block entirely. Because this document is explicitly a cross-agent drift report, removing those fields loses provenance and status metadata that downstream reviewers/tools rely on to keep research-grade imports separate from operational doctrine.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

## General comments

### @AceHack (2026-05-16T23:20:06Z)

Codex finding addressed in commit 614304d. Added §33 four-header block (Scope / Attribution / Operational status / Non-fusion disclaimer) plus YAML frontmatter aligning with PR #3884 convention. Arming auto-merge.
