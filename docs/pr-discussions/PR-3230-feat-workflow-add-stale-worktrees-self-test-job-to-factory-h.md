## Pull request overview

Adds a third factory-hygiene workflow job so the stale-worktrees audit tool’s unit tests run in the daily hygiene cadence.

**Changes:**
- Adds `stale-worktrees-self-test` job on Ubuntu 24.04.
- Checks out the repo, installs Bun, and runs `tools/hygiene/audit-stale-worktrees.test.ts`.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: .github/workflows/factory-hygiene-audit-cadence.yml:114 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T20:36:09Z):

P1: The new stale-worktrees self-test job is not reachable from PRs that change only the stale-worktrees tool or its test, because `on.pull_request.paths` still lists only the first two hygiene tools plus this workflow. This undermines the PR self-test cadence for the newly composed tool; add the stale-worktrees source/test paths to the workflow trigger.

### Thread 2: .github/workflows/factory-hygiene-audit-cadence.yml:114 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T20:36:09Z):

P2: Adding the third hygiene job leaves the workflow's file-level documentation stale: the header still describes this as a cadence for two tools and lists only the rule-cross-refs and memory-index audits. Update that summary/composes-with text so future maintainers do not miss that stale-worktrees is part of the daily cadence.
