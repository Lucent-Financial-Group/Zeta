# PR #3324: memory(CURRENT-otto): 2026-05-15 update — post-cascade integration + Manifesto V2 + wait-cadence

## PR description

## Summary

Self-curation update to `memory/CURRENT-otto.md` adding a 2026-05-15 update section covering the post-cascade substrate integration:

- Manifesto V2 shadow-lock landed (PR #3306) + B-0524 + B-0525 backlog rows
- Ani persona-folder cascade-closing (PR #3311 + #3312)
- Wait-for-consolidation IS Aaron's edge (load-bearing)
- Forgetting as back-pressure + triplet-as-coherent-shape META + bootstream compression + pressure-valve / selfish-perspective-filter substrate
- CURRENT files fast-path discoverability fix
- Wait-for-consolidation cadence activated 2026-05-15

Per CURRENT-otto.md's own self-curation right ("Owner: Otto; I can revise it per my own discretion"), this is Otto-CLI's substrate-honest update of its own current substrate.

## Pull request overview

Updates `memory/CURRENT-otto.md` with a new 2026-05-15 section capturing the latest “currently-in-force” Otto substrate after the post-cascade integration (Manifesto V2 shadow-lock, Ani cascade-closing pointers, and the wait-for-consolidation cadence).

**Changes:**
- Adds a 2026-05-15 update section summarizing newly landed repo substrate (Manifesto V2 + backlog rows + §33 archive pointer).
- Records the operational posture/cadence activation (wait-for-consolidation) and associated rationale for future cold-boot reads.
- Adds several pointers to “feedback_*.md” artifacts referenced as load-bearing context.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: memory/CURRENT-otto.md:11 (unresolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-15T00:34:39Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Bump `Last updated` metadata when adding a new dated update**

This commit adds a `2026-05-15` update section, but the file header still says `Last updated: 2026-05-14`, so the document now has conflicting freshness signals. Any reader or automation that keys off the top-level metadata can treat this state snapshot as stale and miss the new operational posture you just recorded. Please update the header date in the same change whenever a newer dated section is introduced.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

### Thread 2: memory/CURRENT-otto.md:13 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T00:36:02Z):

P1: The file header still says **Last updated: 2026-05-14** even though this PR adds a new 2026-05-15 update section. Please update the header date to match the latest section so readers don’t treat this as stale.

### Thread 3: memory/CURRENT-otto.md:22 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T00:36:03Z):

P1: The referenced `feedback_*.md` files in this new section (e.g., `feedback_aaron_wait_for_consolidation_is_his_edge_...`, `feedback_aaron_forgetting_as_backpressure_...`, etc.) do not exist under `memory/` in the repo, so these look like broken in-repo pointers. If these are intended to be user-scope-only artifacts, please label them explicitly as such (or link to the user-scope index / repo mirror) so repo-only readers aren’t sent to dead paths.
