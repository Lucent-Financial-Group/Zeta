# PR #3602: shard(tick): 2214Z — auto-merge arming sweep #3594 (merged) + #3599 (armed)

## PR description

## Summary

- Refresh surfaced 2 stuck-no-action PRs in non-DIRTY actionable set; both Aaron-authored Lior-payload docs-only additive.
- **#3594** CLEAN no-arm → `gh pr merge --auto --squash` → MERGED at 22:14:50Z (origin/main advanced d189638→4442e3f).
- **#3599** BLOCKED wait-CI no-arm → `gh pr merge --auto --squash` → ARMED at 22:14:52Z.
- Lior-gemini still active during this tick (3 processes); borrow-on-existing pattern used to bypass `worktree add` ref-pack contention path.

## Test plan

- [x] Pre/post-commit tree-size 52→52 (no Lior corruption)
- [x] `git status --short` = 0 lines after `switch -c` from origin/main
- [x] #3594 confirmed MERGED state via `gh pr view --json state`
- [x] #3599 confirmed armed via `gh pr view --json autoMergeRequest`
- [x] CronList shows `d97cdace` still armed

## Pull request overview

Adds a hygiene-history tick shard documenting a 22:14Z autonomous-loop auto-merge arming sweep for stuck actionable PRs.

**Changes:**
- Records PR queue refresh results for #3594 and #3599.
- Documents auto-merge actions and verification signals.
- Captures the borrowed-worktree mitigation used while Lior-gemini processes were active.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/15/2214Z.md:29 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T22:18:44Z):

P1: This safety note is inaccurate: `git switch -c ... origin/main` in an existing worktree updates the checked-out files as well as HEAD and the index. Since the line is documenting a mitigation for the active-Lior corruption risk, saying that only HEAD and the local index moved can mislead future operators into treating this as safer than it is; describe the working-tree update explicitly or limit the claim to the specific checks that were actually performed.
