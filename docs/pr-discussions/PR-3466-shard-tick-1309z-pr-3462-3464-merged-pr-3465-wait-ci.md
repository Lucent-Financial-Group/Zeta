**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Reference an existing shard when citing prior tick state**

This line records PR #3465 as coming from a `1305Z` shard, but there is no `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/15/1305Z.md` entry in the repo history; the citation therefore points to a non-existent provenance record. In this project, tick files are the audit substrate for reproducibility, so a broken shard reference makes the state transition unverifiable for later reviewers and tools.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-15T13:05:11Z):

Stale review — `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/15/1305Z.md` (blob `8fa88fc5`) exists on origin/main via PR #3465 merge `ad3206b`. Repo-wide check ran against a pre-merge snapshot. Note also that the 1305Z label itself has a separate chronology-drift issue acknowledged on PR #3465 + PR #3467 (filenames were ahead of actual commit-time); going forward filename = `date -u +%H%MZ` at write-time. Resolving.
