# PR #3175: shard(tick): 1834Z — PR #3165 recovery (3 CI failures + 1 Codex thread)

## PR description

## Summary

Tick shard for 2026-05-14T18:34Z.

PR #3165 (B-0514 + 1825Z shard) hit \`fix-failed-checks\` gate. All three issues addressed on the #3165 branch at commit \`e12106c\`:

1. **CI: \`check docs/BACKLOG.md generated-index drift\`** — regenerated via \`BACKLOG_WRITE_FORCE=1 bun tools/backlog/generate-index.ts\`; 7 missing rows added (B-0460, B-0500-B-0506, B-0514)
2. **CI: \`lint (markdownlint)\` MD032** at 1825Z.md:49 — added blank-line list separator
3. **Codex P2 thread**: 6-vs-7 PR count inconsistency in shard table — removed #3156 from table (it had merged earlier; not in refresh count) + added parenthetical note

Codex thread resolved via GraphQL. PR #3165 transitioned BLOCKED → wait-ci.

## Side observations

**Multi-Otto branch-name collision detected**: my initial branch name \`shard/tick-1834Z-pr3165-recovery-2026-05-14\` already existed on origin with another Otto's commit (\`b6c6ad5\` — DeepSeek wormhole/horizon-controls archive). Untangled by cherry-picking my single shard commit to a disambiguated branch name (\`shard/tick-1834Z-pr3165-recovery-otto-cli-2026-05-14\`); the parallel Otto's branch is preserved as-is for their independent PR. This is the canonical multi-foreground-surface lockup pattern \`claim-acquire-before-worktree-work.md\` describes.

**Stale .git/index.lock**: first commit attempt hit "another git process seems to be running"; lock file actually didn't exist (cleared by parallel Otto finishing a write). Retry succeeded.

## Mechanization candidate

A \`tools/hygiene/audit-tick-shard-prerequisites.ts\` that runs markdownlint + BACKLOG.md regen check locally before push would catch issues 1+2 pre-PR. Composes with B-0506 (worktree prune cadence). Not filed this tick to avoid overcrowding.

## Test plan

- [x] PR #3165 transitioned BLOCKED → wait-ci (verified via poll-pr-gate)
- [x] BACKLOG.md \`--check\` passes
- [x] Shard committed at canonical path on disambiguated branch
- [x] Parallel Otto's b6c6ad5 commit preserved untouched

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/1834Z.md:1 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T18:42:12Z):

P1: The title says there were 3 CI failures plus 1 Codex thread, but the shard body only documents two CI failures (BACKLOG drift and markdownlint) plus the Codex thread, and the refresh table says only 1 required check was failed. Please either document the missing third CI failure or adjust the count so the shard is internally consistent.

This issue also appears on line 62 of the same file.

### Thread 2: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/1834Z.md:28 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T18:42:13Z):

P1: This count does not match the IDs listed: B-0460 (1), B-0500 through B-0506 (7), and B-0514 (1) total 9 entries, not 7. Please correct either the count or the listed range.

## General comments

### @AceHack (2026-05-14T18:40:42Z)

Post-tick observation: PR #3165 (which this shard documents recovering) was subsequently closed by Aaron with the comment _"Decomposed into atomic PRs #3172 and #3174 per Lior's decomposition discipline."_ The recovery work is preserved in [#3172](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3172) (B-0514 row) + [#3174](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3174) (1825Z shard). This shard remains substrate-honest as a snapshot of the tick — the recovery happened, it just landed via decomposed PRs rather than the original #3165.
