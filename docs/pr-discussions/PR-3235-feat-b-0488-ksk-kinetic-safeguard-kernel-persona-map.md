# PR #3235: feat(b-0488): KSK (Kinetic Safeguard Kernel) persona map

## PR description

## Summary

Per-product persona doc for KSK (Kinetic Safeguard Kernel) using the B-0485 template. Closes [B-0488](docs/backlog/P1/B-0488-ksk-persona-map-2026-05-14.md) which unblocks B-0492/B-0493 skill-mapping work.

## Personas defined

**Primary (3)**:
- `ksk-agent-developer` — engineers integrating "am I allowed to do this?" checks into AI agents
- `ksk-robotics-designer` — consent-first robotics / actuator system designers (NVIDIA Thor Homeland-Security clearance lineage)
- `ksk-security-engineer` — engineers building KSK itself in `Lucent-Financial-Group/lucent-ksk`

**Secondary (1)**: `ksk-clearance-deployer` — Homeland-Security / clearance-aware deployers

**Adjacent (1)**: `ksk-compliance-auditor` — SOC 2 / HIPAA / ISO 27001 auditors consuming KSK signed receipts

**Refused (2 — HARD LIMITS)**:
- `ksk-refused-weapons-control` — autonomous-weapons / kill-chain designers using KSK as a "consent UI" wrapper. Per `methodology-hard-limits.md` HARD LIMITS #1 + #3: laundered consent + violates consent-first design intent (PR #2892).
- `ksk-refused-apt-operator` — nation-state APT operators using KSK as a privilege oracle (receipt-replay, authorization enumeration, "stealth mode" feature requests). Per `mechanical-authorization-check.md`: not in the authorization-source list.

## Why the refused-persona list is load-bearing

KSK's terminal purpose is **human-in-the-loop refusal of impactful AI actions**. A weapons-system integration would launder the appearance of consent (the receipts say "authorized" but the operator never had meaningful refusal). An APT integration would use KSK's transparency against its own purpose (mapping authority topology). Both are structural adversaries, not off-target customers.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Template from [B-0485](docs/research/2026-05-14-persona-mapping-framework-b0485.md) applied
- [x] Primary personas fully documented (3, exceeds the "grey-hat / ethical researcher" minimum — folded that framing into `ksk-security-engineer`)
- [x] At least 2 refused personas with explicit HARD LIMITS rationale (R1 + R2)
- [x] Output doc at `docs/personas/ksk-personas.md`
- [x] B-0488 status: `open` → `in-progress` (closes on merge)
- [ ] B-0492 `composes_with:` pointer backfilled (deferred to a follow-up; B-0492 row may not exist yet — needs scoping)

## Test plan

- [x] `markdownlint-cli2` clean on both files
- [x] Composite-guard used for the commit: `test "$(git branch --show-current)" = "<expected>" && git commit`
- [x] `gh pr create --head` explicit ref used
- [ ] CI clears
- [ ] Auto-merge

**docs/personas/ksk-personas.md:375**
* P1 (name-attribution policy): This section repeats direct named attribution (e.g., “Aaron + Amara’s …”) inside a current-state `docs/personas/**` doc. Per `docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md` “No name attribution in code, docs, or skills” (around lines 671–760), prefer role-refs here and keep named provenance on the allowlisted history surfaces (e.g., link to the relevant `memory/**`/`docs/research/**` artifact that preserves the attribution).
```
2. Compromise the protective lineage (KSK's reputation is its value;
   weapons-system integration destroys it)
3. Violate the consent-first design intent (PR #2892 — Aaron + Amara's
   consent-first design origin)
```

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/backlog/P1/B-0488-ksk-persona-map-2026-05-14.md:4 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T20:48:48Z):

P0 (schema/tooling): `status: in-progress` is not a valid backlog-row status per `tools/backlog/README.md` (allowed: `open` / `closed` / `superseded-by-B-NNNN` / `deferred` / `decomposed`). Please change this back to a supported value (typically keep `open` until the work is actually complete, then set `closed` with `closed`/`closed_by`).

### Thread 2: docs/personas/ksk-personas.md:8 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T20:48:48Z):

P1 (name-attribution policy): This is a current-state doc under `docs/personas/`, but it introduces direct contributor/persona names (e.g., `**Author:** Otto`, and `Aaron+Amara` in the substrate line). Per `docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md` “No name attribution in code, docs, or skills” (around lines 671–760), please rewrite these to role-refs (e.g., “the agent”, “the human maintainer”, “external collaborator”) and/or move the named provenance into an allowlisted history surface (`memory/**` or `docs/research/**`) and link to it from here.

This issue also appears on line 372 of the same file.
