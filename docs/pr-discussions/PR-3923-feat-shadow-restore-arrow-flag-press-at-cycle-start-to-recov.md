# PR #3923: feat(shadow): --restore-arrow flag — press → at cycle start to recover cron-erased autocomplete

## PR description

## Summary

- Adds `--restore-arrow` flag to `tools/shadow/shadow-observer.ts`. When enabled, the observer presses → (right arrow) at the start of every cycle in the frontmost terminal.
- Purpose: when an autonomous-loop cron tick fires a new user prompt in the Claude Code CLI, any grey-text autocomplete in the input field gets erased. Pressing → restores it.
- New AppleScript: `tools/shadow/restore-arrow.applescript` (frontmost-terminal-gated; key code 124).
- launchd plist updated to include `--restore-arrow` alongside existing `--dry-run` (orthogonal flags both active by default).

## Design notes

- **Not suppressed by `--dry-run`** — the two flags are orthogonal:
  - `--dry-run` prevents the destructive Enter-to-accept keystroke
  - `--restore-arrow` is non-destructive (no-op when no autocomplete + cursor at end)
- **Caveat**: cursor mid-line + → moves cursor right by one character. Non-destructive but not silent. Accepted per maintainer judgment ("rare in practice given typical input flow").
- **v1 scope** — blind press + log. Delta detection (sample text-state before/after press to log WHAT was restored) deferred to v2 once we observe v1 behavior.

## Test plan

- [x] 54/54 unit tests pass (49 pre-existing + 5 new for restore-arrow behavior)
- [x] Smoke test: \`bun tools/shadow/shadow-observer.ts --dry-run --once --restore-arrow\` produces \`restore-arrow\` event in log
- [ ] Manual verification: install launchd plist with new args + observe \`pressed:<terminal>\` entries in shadow-observer.log under live cron-tick conditions

## Origin

Maintainer 2026-05-16T17:21Z: *"ship the restore arrow"* — closing a design dialogue about the cron-tick-erases-autocomplete UX wrinkle observed earlier in the session.

## Pull request overview

Adds an optional “restore autocomplete” keystroke to the shadow observer loop to recover grey-text suggestions that get cleared by cron-triggered prompt refreshes in the frontmost terminal.

**Changes:**
- Add `--restore-arrow` flag and `restore-arrow` event logging to the shadow observer cycle.
- Add a new macOS AppleScript (`restore-arrow.applescript`) that presses the right-arrow key only when a known terminal emulator is frontmost.
- Update launchd LaunchAgent template to run the observer with `--restore-arrow` enabled, and add unit tests for the new behavior.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: tools/shadow/shadow-observer.ts:42 (unresolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-16T17:54:18Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Correct dry-run contract for restore-arrow**

The flag docs now claim `--restore-arrow` is “Suppressed under --dry-run”, but `runOneCycle` still invokes `restoreArrowFn` whenever `config.restoreArrow` is true, and the launchd plist enables both flags by default. This mismatch can cause operators to rely on `--dry-run` as a no-keystroke safety mode while still injecting a right-arrow keypress, which is user-visible when the cursor is mid-line; the docs should match behavior (or behavior should be gated by `dryRun`) to avoid unsafe assumptions.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

### Thread 2: tools/shadow/shadow-observer.ts:42 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T17:54:24Z):

The `--restore-arrow` flag documentation contradicts the implementation and tests. Here it says the arrow press is “Suppressed under --dry-run”, but `runOneCycle` logs/executes restore-arrow even when `dryRun=true` (and there’s a unit test asserting that). Please update this flag description (and, if needed, the earlier `--dry-run` safety bullet) to reflect the actual orthogonal behavior: `--dry-run` suppresses Enter/accept, but `--restore-arrow` still presses → when enabled.

### Thread 3: tools/shadow/shadow-observer.ts:252 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T17:54:24Z):

`pressRestoreArrow` drops `stderr` details when `osascript` exits non-zero, returning only `error:osascript-exit-<code>`. In practice (e.g., accessibility permission denied), this makes the logged verdict hard to diagnose. Consider including a trimmed `stderr` snippet in the error verdict (similar to `detectGreyTextMacOS`), or mapping known permission-denied patterns to a `skipped:<reason>` verdict to avoid noisy, opaque error logs.
