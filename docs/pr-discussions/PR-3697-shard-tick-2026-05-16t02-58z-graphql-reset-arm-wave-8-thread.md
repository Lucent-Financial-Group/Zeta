# PR #3697: shard(tick): 2026-05-16T02:58Z — GraphQL reset → arm wave + 8-thread cleanup

## PR description

Tick 9 (post-GraphQL-reset). Arm wave on 4 queued PRs (#3693 already merged by AceHack 16s after reset; #3690 #3692 #3695 armed). 8 unresolved threads investigated:

- #3690 (1): table-pipe complaint = Copilot false positive (verified by awk inspection). No-op resolve.
- #3692 (4): ALL real (sonarjs disable, main+import.meta.main guard, generic URI scheme, --files validation). Fixed via commit d299c7d.
- #3695 (3): 2 real prose errors fixed via commit e0828b5; 1 stale link self-resolved when sibling PR merged.

Discipline reinforced: verify-before-fixing applies to Copilot reviewer output too (same table-pipe hallucination as #3685 from tick 6).

## Pull request overview

Adds a new tick-history shard documenting the 2026-05-16T02:58Z autonomous-loop tick, focused on the post-GraphQL-reset auto-merge arming wave and cleanup of 8 previously-unresolved PR review threads.

**Changes:**
- Adds tick shard `0258Z.md` describing actions taken on PRs #3690/#3692/#3695 and recording outcomes.
- Captures lessons learned about “verify before fixing” when handling reviewer feedback.
- Records operational state (GraphQL budget, queue status) and next-tick candidates.

* P2 (documentation): Same table-format issue here: `||` creates an empty leading column. Prefer a single leading `|` so this renders as a 3-column table and stays consistent with the surrounding markdown-table style used in other shards.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/0258Z.md:3 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T03:06:10Z):

P1 (codebase_conventions): This tick shard starts with an ATX heading, but the documented tick-shard schema requires the first non-empty line to be a 6-column `| ... |` row (docs/hygiene-history/ticks/README.md:53-57) and the validator `tools/hygiene/check-tick-history-shard-schema.ts` will flag this file as a violation. Consider prepending the canonical schema row as line 1 (hybrid pattern: schema row first, rich body below) so existing tooling can parse/collate shards reliably.

### Thread 2: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/0258Z.md:4 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T03:06:10Z):

P1 (bug/xref): The parent-tick link points to `0252Z.md`, but there is no `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/0252Z.md` in this PR/branch. If this PR merges before the parent shard PR, `Parent tick` becomes a broken relative link on `main`. Either include the parent shard in this PR or link to an already-present shard (or an immutable permalink) so the reference is valid at merge time.

### Thread 3: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/0258Z.md:12 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T03:06:10Z):

P2 (documentation): These table rows start with `||`, which renders as an empty first column and is inconsistent with other tick shards’ tables (single leading `|`). Dropping the extra leading pipe will make the table render as the intended 3-column table and avoid confusion with the earlier “double-pipe table” discussion.

This issue also appears on line 64 of the same file.
