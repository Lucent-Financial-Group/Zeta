# PR #3302: shard(tick): 2337Z — off-duty checkpoint 1-hour mark

## PR description

## Summary

- Second off-duty checkpoint shard, 1 hour after #3293 (22:36Z)
- Validates first checkpoint's archaeology argument empirically
- Distinguishes "stable off-duty + Lior background substrate" from "Otto-CLI broken"

## Lior background substrate during this hour (5 PRs)

- #3241 shadow Catch 39
- #3294 shadow + archive + B-0202 decompose
- #3261 decompose B-0139 → B-0351
- #3297 archive PRs 3290-3294
- #3298 shadow metadata-churn drift

Otto-CLI surface stayed observational throughout — discipline-compliant within Aaron's off-duty signal.

## Test plan

- [x] Branch verified before commit
- [x] Single file added
- [x] Auto-merge will arm post-create

## Pull request overview

Adds a hygiene-history tick “checkpoint shard” documenting the 23:37Z off-duty 1-hour mark (continuity since the 22:36Z checkpoint), intended to distinguish “stable off-duty + background substrate” from a stalled tick loop.

**Changes:**
- Added a new tick log entry for 2026-05-14 23:37Z under `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/`.
- Captured continuity notes, composition references, and a short PR/HEAD table for the intervening hour.

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/2337Z.md:16 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T23:39:55Z):

The time window here appears reversed/ambiguous: "23:36Z – 22:36Z – 60min" reads like it runs backward. Consider rewriting as a forward range (e.g., 22:36Z–23:36Z) to avoid confusion in tick-history archaeology.

### Thread 2: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/2337Z.md:27 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T23:39:55Z):

This table uses a double leading pipe ("||") on the header/separator/rows, which renders as an extra empty first column in Markdown. Use single leading pipes consistently (matching other tick files) so the table renders correctly.
