### Thread 1: .gemini/bin/lior-loop-tick.ts:32 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-13T23:28:32Z):

**<sub><sub>![P1 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P1-orange?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Propagate spawnSync errors instead of reporting success**

`spawnSync` sets `result.error` for execution failures such as `ENOBUFS`; with stderr now piped, a verbose Gemini stderr stream can exceed the default sync buffer and land here. Exiting `0` in this branch marks the tick as successful even though the agent run never completed, so launchd/health checks lose the failure signal and the loop can silently skip work. Return a non-zero status here (or raise `maxBuffer`/stream stderr) so real execution failures remain observable.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

## General comments

### @AceHack (2026-05-13T23:31:57Z)

Resolution note (Otto-CLI rebase 2026-05-13 23:30Z): the Codex P1 was authored against the pre-rebase version (commit `a5d5b9a` which incorrectly exited 0 on `result.error`). The rebase onto current main dropped that commit because its intent is already realized + improved in `b2c063e` (PR #3049's squash-merged version on main): spawn errors `exit(1)` correctly, plus added 10MiB maxBuffer + tightened 429 regex.

The PR's diff vs main is now exactly the 1-line decomposition rule addition. spawnSync-error handling is unchanged from current main.

Resolving the thread.
