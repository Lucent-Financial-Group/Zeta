# PR #3729: shard(tick): 2026-05-16T04:15Z — PR #3722 Copilot P1 fix + thread resolved

## PR description

## Summary

- Cold-boot autonomous-loop tick. Sentinel was missing on wake; armed `<<autonomous-loop>>` first per catch-43 rule.
- Fixed PR #3722 Copilot P1: inline code span with literal backtick inside character class. Switched to double-backtick code-span form.
- Thread `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM6ChX1O` resolved via GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` mutation; PR #3722 gate moved BLOCKED → wait-ci, auto-merge re-armed.
- Peer Otto-CLI detected on wake (PIDs 2706 + 2710, Claude Desktop). Substantive work confined to non-pack-contending operations.

## Test plan

- [x] `bun tools/hygiene/check-shard-before-push.ts` ok on this shard (MD032 + markdownlint + relative-path audit)
- [x] `bun tools/hygiene/check-shard-before-push.ts` ok on fixed 0354Z shard
- [x] PR #3722 `bun tools/github/poll-pr-gate.ts` returns `unresolvedThreads: 0`
- [x] PR #3722 auto-merge armed; CI required checks rerunning post-fix-commit
