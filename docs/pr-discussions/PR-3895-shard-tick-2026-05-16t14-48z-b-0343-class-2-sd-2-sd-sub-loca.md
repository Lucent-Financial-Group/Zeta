# PR #3895: shard(tick): 2026-05-16T14:48Z — B-0343 = class #2-SD; #2-SD sub-location catalog now has 6 patterns; 39/39 triaged

## PR description

Forced-escalation tick (brief-ack #6 → pure-git substrate). Audit: B-0343 (test-repo seeding script TS, P1 friction-reducer).

## Audit

- `tools/bootstrap-razor/seed-test-repo.ts` exists (124 lines)
- Row's pre-start checklist explicitly: 'Bounded slice: minimal TS stub (dry-run + manifest reader, no gh, no create). Follow-up: gh api, idempotency, commit logic.'
- 3/4 acceptance: script path ✓ + manifest read ✓ + --dry-run ✓; idempotency requires unshipped gh-api slice

**Class #2-SD** (partial, self-documenting via row's own bounded-slice note). NO edit needed.

## #2-SD sub-location catalog now at 6 patterns

This session has accumulated 6 distinct row-body locations carrying #2-SD self-doc signal:

| Location | First example |
|---|---|
| Frontmatter `classification: blocked` | B-0037.2 |
| Inline `Status` section | B-0118 |
| Acceptance `[ ]` checkboxes | B-0534 |
| Slice-progress table | B-0314 |
| **Pre-start re-decomposition note** | **B-0343 (this PR)** |
| Embedded falsifier (#2-Ready overlay) | B-0197 |

Auto-classifier needs multi-pattern detection across all 6 locations.

## Tally

**39/39 audit candidates triaged this session** — cycle saturated.

## Pull request overview

Adds a new hygiene-history tick shard for 2026-05-16T14:48Z, documenting the forced-escalation audit of backlog row B-0343 and extending the observed #2-SD sub-location catalog to 6 patterns.

**Changes:**
- Adds a new tick log entry capturing the B-0343 audit evidence (script/manifest existence, bounded-slice note, dry-run presence).
- Records updated drift-audit tally counts and a catalog of #2-SD signal locations.
- Captures operational context (rate-limit tier, sentinel status, PR reference).

* P1: This acceptance-criteria table uses `||` at the start of each row, which introduces an unintended empty column and renders incorrectly. Use standard Markdown table syntax with a single leading `|` like other tick files.
```
| Acceptance criterion | State |
|---|---|
| 1. Script at `tools/bootstrap-razor/seed-test-repo.ts` | ✅ shipped (124 lines) |
| 2. Reads seed manifest from `docs/bootstrap-razor/SEED-MANIFEST.md` | ✅ manifest exists + path referenced at line 20-21 |
| 3. Idempotent — re-running against existing repo reports status, no duplicate | ❌ row's own line 4-5: "No gh, no create, no repo mutation" |
```
**docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/1448Z.md:62**
* P1: The drift-audit tally table is written with a `||` row prefix, which produces an empty first column and breaks GitHub Markdown rendering. Switch to the usual `| ... |` table format used in other tick shards.
```
| Class | Count | Latest |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Pure drift (closed) | 16 (10 baseline + 6 this session) | B-0197 #3893 |
| 1-Ready | 1 (closed via #3882) | B-0049.2 |
| 1-DepBlocked | 1 | B-0457 |
```
**docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/1448Z.md:86**
* P1: This table also uses `||` at the start of rows, which creates an extra empty column and renders incorrectly. Please convert to standard Markdown table formatting (`| Location | Examples |`, `|---|---|`, etc.).
```
| Location | Examples |
|---|---|
| Frontmatter `classification: blocked` | B-0037.2, B-0037.3 (stale after dep merged) |
| Inline `Status` section | B-0118, B-0129 |
| Acceptance `[ ]` checkboxes | B-0534, B-0418, B-0458 |
```
**docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/1448Z.md:102**
* P1: The counter/disposition table is using `||` prefixes, which adds an unintended empty first column and breaks table rendering. Use the standard single-pipe Markdown table syntax here as well.
```

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/1448Z.md:13 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T15:02:21Z):

P1: These tables start with `||` (empty first column), which breaks Markdown table rendering and is inconsistent with other tick shards (they use `| ... |`). Convert this to a normal pipe table (`| Surface | State |` etc.) so the content renders correctly on GitHub.

This issue also appears in the following locations of the same file:
- line 36
- line 58
- line 82
- line 98

### Thread 2: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/1448Z.md:26 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T15:02:21Z):

P1 (shell portability): In the example command, the pattern argument starts with `--dry-run`, which many `grep` implementations will treat as an option unless you terminate options (e.g., add `--` before the pattern or use `-e`). As written, this command is likely to error instead of producing the shown output.

### Thread 3: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/1448Z.md:26 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T15:02:21Z):

P1: The `wc -l` output here says `tools/bootstrap-razor/seed-test-repo.ts` is 124 lines, but the current file in-repo is 125 lines (ends at line 125). Please update the recorded line count in this shard so the audit evidence matches the repository state.
