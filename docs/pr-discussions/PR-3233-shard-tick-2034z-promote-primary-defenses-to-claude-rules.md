# PR #3233: shard(tick): 2034Z — promote primary defenses to .claude/rules/

## PR description

## Summary

Tick 2026-05-14T20:34Z shard. Substantive work in [#3232](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3232) — promotes the two primary contamination defenses from B-0519 RCA (grep-discoverable backlog row) to `.claude/rules/zeta-expected-branch.md` (auto-loaded at cold-boot).

## What landed

- [#3232](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3232) — extends the existing branch-verification rule with the field-test caveat + the two new primary defenses + the composite operator-discipline snippet.
- This shard.

## Prior-tick PRs status

Three merged this batch:
- [#3222](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3222) (shard 2010Z) — MERGED as `82edec5`.
- [#3227](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3227) (shard 2026Z) — MERGED as `8b59343`.
- [#3228](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3228) (B-0519 RCA update) — MERGED as `36fbe4c`.
- [#3231](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3231) (shard 2030Z) — wait-ci, autoMerge armed.

## Session running tally

Five merged (#3221 + #3222 + #3226 + #3227 + #3228); three wait-ci (#3231 + #3232 + this shard's PR).

## Composite guard pattern (used in this tick's commits + PRs)

```bash
test "$(git branch --show-current)" = "<expected>" || exit 1
git commit -m "..."

gh pr create --head <my-branch> --base main --title "..." --body "..."
```

Mechanizes the operator-discipline into the same shell call as the action, so the check can't be read-then-skipped.

## Test plan

- [x] Composite guard used for this commit + #3232 commit
- [x] `gh pr create --head` explicit ref used
- [x] markdownlint-cli2 clean
- [ ] CI clears
- [ ] Auto-merge

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/2034Z.md:72 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T20:39:57Z):

Session running tally has an internal inconsistency: it says "two wait-ci" but then lists three items (#3231 + #3232 + this shard PR). Also the wrapped continuation line starts a new paragraph; consider keeping it on one line or indenting as a continuation for readability.
