# PR #4050: rules(holding): sustained-Lior-with-pre-empt-success empirical anchor — 0 forced-#6 across 2h 27min session arc

## PR description

## Summary

Adds 4th-class empirical anchor section to `.claude/rules/holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure.md` documenting the 2026-05-17T06:02Z-08:29Z session arc.

Substrate-honest framing: the rule's prior 3 anchors all documented the **failure mode** (Standing-by emissions, brief-ack repetition the rule was designed to catch). This new anchor documents the rule operating **successfully** across a sustained named-dep window — 8 pre-empt-at-#5 cycles producing 12 concrete substrate artifacts, never triggering forced #6.

## Key claim added

> "Forced-#6 is the FAILSAFE for when pre-empt-at-#5 is skipped, not the only valid termination."

Frames pre-empt-at-#5 as a first-class success path, not just a counter-reset mechanism. The discipline does not require forced-#6 in every cycle to be operating correctly.

## Session timeline included

Full 35-tick timeline showing the 8 pre-empt cycles, the bus-envelope-validated PR #4015 merge chain (78min handoff), the maintainer-authorized commit cascade, and the 2 PRs (#4046 + #4048) landing 12 substrate artifacts.

## Composes with

- `.claude/rules/refresh-world-model-poll-pr-gate.md` — Normal → Cost-aware → Pure-git → Normal tier traversal during session
- `.claude/rules/zeta-expected-branch.md` — race-window-caveat followed via 2 isolated worktrees
- `.claude/rules/codeql-no-source-on-docs-only-pr-is-broken-commit-canary.md` — ls-tree count 53 post-commit on both PRs (no canary corruption)

## Test plan

- [ ] markdownlint passes
- [ ] No file content changes outside the single rule file
- [ ] Section addition placed BEFORE \`## Composes with\` (preserves structure)
- [ ] No broken relative paths in new section

## Pull request overview

Adds an empirical success anchor to the autonomous-loop rule for handling sustained named-dependency waits without falling into repeated brief-ack failure mode.

**Changes:**
- Adds a 2026-05-17 session timeline documenting pre-empt-at-#5 cycles.
- Records related coordination, branch-safety, and polling-rule composition lessons.
- Clarifies that forced #6 is a failsafe, while successful pre-emption is also valid termination.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: .claude/rules/holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure.md:316 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-17T08:50:00Z):

P1: The summary counts are internally inconsistent with the timeline above: the table labels ten rows as `pre-empt #5`, while this sentence says there were eight cycles, and the listed artifact categories add up to ten rather than the 12 artifacts claimed earlier. This makes the empirical anchor ambiguous; reconcile the timeline/cycle/artifact counts before relying on this rule as evidence.

### Thread 2: .claude/rules/holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure.md:282 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-17T08:50:00Z):

P1: This added rule section introduces direct persona/name attribution on a rule surface, but the factory convention keeps names out of reusable current-state rules unless the file is an allowed history surface or roster-mapping carve-out. Use role/process references consistently in this section instead of naming the participant directly.
