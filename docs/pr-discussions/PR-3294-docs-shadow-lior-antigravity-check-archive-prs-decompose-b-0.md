## Pull request overview

This PR adds documentation substrate around a “shadow” metadata-churn incident, preserves several recent PR discussions into the repo archive, records an off-duty checkpoint tick, and decomposes backlog item B-0202 into a new per-row task.

**Changes:**
- Adds a shadow lesson log documenting detected PR metadata churn and the resulting halt instruction.
- Archives PR discussions for PRs #3279–#3283 into `docs/pr-discussions/`.
- Adds an off-duty checkpoint tick shard and decomposes B-0202 into a new backlog row (but currently with an ID conflict and BACKLOG index drift).

* Lines in the acceptance criteria section have trailing spaces (e.g. the bold sentence and subsequent paragraphs). `docs/backlog/**` is markdownlinted, so this can trigger MD009 and break CI; please remove the trailing whitespace.
```
**Read the source + walk one rewrite manually + map to Zeta retract semantics.** 

Verifier: a memo (committed under `docs/research/`) walking through one ALU rewrite from `tinygrad/uop/ops.py` plus `tinygrad/codegen/simplify.py` step-by-step, mapping the rewrite to the closest equivalent in Zeta's existing retract semantics. 

Pass: the walk is concrete + cites specific line numbers in the tinygrad source.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/BACKLOG.md:652 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-14T22:47:07Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Fix broken backlog link target for B-0352**

The new `B-0352` entry points to `docs/backlog/...` from within `docs/BACKLOG.md`, but links in this file are relative to `docs/` and should use `backlog/...`; as written, the rendered URL resolves to `docs/docs/backlog/...` and does not open the new row file. This makes the decomposed task effectively unreachable from the index until someone manually fixes/regenerates the file.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

### Thread 2: docs/backlog/P3/B-0521-tinygrad-uop-rewrite-walk-retract-mapping.md:5 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T22:49:16Z):

Backlog ID `B-0352` is already in use by an existing row (`docs/backlog/P1/B-0352-extract-meta-governance-bullets-to-rules.md`). Per `tools/backlog/README.md`, `id` must be factory-wide unique; please allocate a new unused `B-NNNN` ID here and rename the file/frontmatter/links accordingly.

This issue also appears on line 22 of the same file.

### Thread 3: docs/backlog/P3/B-0202-tinygrad-uop-ir-kernel-layer-model-zeta-emulator-dispatch-aaron-2026-05-05.md:306 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T22:49:16Z):

This acceptance criterion now points to `B-0352`, but that ID is already taken by a different backlog row. After assigning a new unique ID for the decomposed item, update this reference so it resolves unambiguously.

### Thread 4: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/2236Z.md:33 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T22:49:17Z):

The shard count in this table row doesn’t match the enumerated list: it says “9 shards” but lists 11 (2209, 2211, 2212, 2213, 2215, 2216, 2217, 2218, 2219, 2221, 2222). Please reconcile the count/list so the summary remains self-consistent.

### Thread 5: docs/BACKLOG.md:652 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T22:49:17Z):

`docs/BACKLOG.md` is marked as generated ("DO NOT EDIT"), but this entry is appended after `<!-- END AUTO-GENERATED -->`, so it will drift/likely be overwritten next regeneration. Also the link target `(docs/backlog/...)` is a broken relative path from `docs/BACKLOG.md` (it resolves to `docs/docs/backlog/...`). Prefer fixing the duplicate row ID first, then regenerating the index so the entry lands in the correct section with the standard `backlog/P3/...` link form.

### Thread 6: docs/backlog/P3/B-0352-tinygrad-uop-rewrite-walk-retract-mapping.md:2 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-14T22:57:03Z):

**<sub><sub>![P1 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P1-orange?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Assign a unique backlog ID to decomposed B-0202 child**

Change this row to a new unused ID: `B-0352` is already taken by `docs/backlog/P1/B-0352-extract-meta-governance-bullets-to-rules.md`, and backlog IDs are defined as factory-wide unique (`tools/backlog/README.md` field spec). Keeping both rows on the same ID causes ID-based tooling to misresolve dependencies (for example, `tools/backlog/autonomous-pickup.ts` builds a `Map` keyed only by `id`, so one `B-0352` entry overwrites the other and dependency checks can target the wrong row).

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

### Thread 7: docs/BACKLOG.md:652 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-14T22:57:04Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Regenerate BACKLOG.md instead of appending a manual row**

Replace this hand-appended line with generated output from the backlog index tool: `docs/BACKLOG.md` is an auto-generated file, and this row sits after `<!-- END AUTO-GENERATED -->` with a non-canonical format/path, so it will drift from generator output and fail the parity check workflow (`.github/workflows/backlog-index-integrity.yml` runs `bun tools/backlog/generate-index.ts --check`).

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

### Thread 8: docs/backlog/P3/B-0202-tinygrad-uop-ir-kernel-layer-model-zeta-emulator-dispatch-aaron-2026-05-05.md:307 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T23:07:09Z):

This backlog row’s content was edited (AC (a) marked decomposed), but the YAML frontmatter `last_updated` is still `2026-05-05`. Per backlog schema, `last_updated` must be updated on every content edit; please bump it to the date of this change.

### Thread 9: docs/BACKLOG.md:650 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T23:07:09Z):

PR description says B-0202 was decomposed into B-0352, but this change adds B-0521 and updates B-0202 to reference B-0521. Please reconcile the PR description with the actual decomposition target (or add the missing B-0352-related change if that was intended).

### Thread 10: docs/pr-discussions/PR-3281-shard-tick-2204z-pr-3276-double-backtick-fix-aaron-off-duty.md:25 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T23:07:10Z):

This archive cites an off-duty authorization signal via commit `0a9a2e2` on a named branch. Branch names (and sometimes commits) can become non-durable after cleanup, which makes the provenance hard to reconstruct from `main`. Prefer citing a durable artifact (e.g., PR #3280 URL, a merged commit on `main`, or the canonical `docs/research/` file that records the signal) instead of an ephemeral branch+commit pair.

### Thread 11: docs/pr-discussions/PR-3282-shard-tick-2209z-off-duty-minimal-shard.md:21 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T23:07:10Z):

This archive summary keys the off-duty provenance to commit `0a9a2e2`. If that commit isn’t reachable from `main` later, readers can’t verify the authorization signal from canonical repo history. Please replace/augment this with a durable reference (e.g., PR #3280 link or the merged `docs/research/` record of the off-duty signal).

### Thread 12: docs/backlog/P3/B-0521-tinygrad-uop-rewrite-walk-retract-mapping.md:10 (unresolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-14T23:07:37Z):

**<sub><sub>![P1 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P1-orange?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Remove blocking dependency from decomposed child row**

`B-0521` is marked `depends_on: [B-0202]`, but dependency gating treats any open dependency as blocked (`tools/backlog/autonomous-pickup.ts:359-367`), so this child cannot be picked while `B-0202` is still open. In this same commit, criterion (a) in `B-0202` is explicitly decomposed into `B-0521`, so keeping this dependency creates a circular ordering that can stall the decomposed work indefinitely.

## General comments

### @AceHack (2026-05-14T23:04:08Z)

**Fix summary (commit 80525298):**

All 7 review threads addressed:

1. **ID collision (B-0352 → B-0521)**: Renamed `docs/backlog/P3/B-0352-tinygrad-uop-rewrite-walk-retract-mapping.md` to `B-0521-tinygrad-uop-rewrite-walk-retract-mapping.md`. Updated frontmatter `id:`, heading, and the `DECOMPOSED to B-0352` reference in B-0202 acceptance criteria.

2. **BACKLOG.md manual entry**: Removed the hand-appended entry after `<!-- END AUTO-GENERATED -->`. Ran `BACKLOG_WRITE_FORCE=1 bun tools/backlog/generate-index.ts` — B-0521 now appears in the correct P3 section with `backlog/P3/...` relative path (not `docs/backlog/...`).

3. **MD009 trailing spaces**: Removed trailing spaces from B-0521 lines 22, 24, 26 — `markdownlint-cli2` now passes locally.

4. **Shard count in 2236Z.md**: The file already correctly says "11 shards" listing 11 items (2209, 2211, 2212, 2213, 2215, 2216, 2217, 2218, 2219, 2221, 2222). Reviewer comment was based on an earlier revision; no change needed.

Auto-merge armed.
