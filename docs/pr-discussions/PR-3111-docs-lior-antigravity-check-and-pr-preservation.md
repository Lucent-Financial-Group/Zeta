## PR description

Automated drift report on the array and PR preservation for #3074, #3075, #2762.

## Reviews

### COMMENTED — @copilot-pull-request-reviewer (2026-05-14T07:42:11Z)

## Pull request overview

Docs-only PR archiving an "antigravity check" drift report plus refreshing three PR-preservation archives (#3074, #3075, #2762). Also includes a tick shard and the closure of backlog row B-0451 (duplicate row-ID substrate cleanup), with `docs/BACKLOG.md` regenerated.

**Changes:**
- Adds a new research note (`docs/research/2026-05-14-shadow-lesson-log-antigravity-check.md`) and a tick shard for 0521Z.
- Refreshes PR-preservation archives for #3074, #3075, #2762 (mostly `archived_at` re-timestamps; #3075 archive added with full review trail).
- Closes B-0451 (status → closed, ACs ticked off, BACKLOG.md row flipped to `[x]`).

Drift detected: this PR is a blob. It mixes B-0451 backlog closure with the Lior antigravity check and PR preservation. I will decompose it into atomic PRs.
