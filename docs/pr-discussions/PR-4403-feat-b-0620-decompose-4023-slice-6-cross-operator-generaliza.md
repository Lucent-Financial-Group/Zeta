## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/backlog/P2/081KS1AX70008QG0R001HRXZTZ-b0620-slice-6-cross-operator-generalization.md:6 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-20T13:07:53Z):

P1: Per tools/backlog/README.md, backlog row frontmatter requires `title` and `last_updated`. This row is missing both, which can lead to blank entries in the generated index and schema drift. Add `title:` (short) and `last_updated:` (same as `created` for a new file).

### Thread 2: docs/backlog/P2/B-0620-slice-6-cross-operator-generalization.md:2 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-20T13:07:53Z):

P1: `id: B-0620.6` doesn't match the documented `B-NNNN` id format in tools/backlog/README.md, and it also doesn't match the filename prefix (`B-0620-...`). Consider using `id: B-0620` and encoding “slice 6” in `title`, or rename the file to start with `B-0620.6-...` if dotted IDs are intended for slices (as in `docs/backlog/P1/081KR2E4K0008QG0R001N1PPHP-...`).

### Thread 3: docs/backlog/P2/B-0620-slice-6-cross-operator-generalization.md:17 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-20T13:07:54Z):

P2: The acceptance criterion references `amazon-orders-extract.ts`, but that path doesn't exist in the repo today. If this is a planned file, consider referencing the expected full path (e.g., under `tools/` if applicable) or describing it generically ("the Amazon orders extraction tool") to avoid stale cross-references.
