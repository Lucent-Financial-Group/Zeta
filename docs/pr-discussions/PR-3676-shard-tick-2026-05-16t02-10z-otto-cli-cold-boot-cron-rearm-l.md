# PR #3676: shard(tick): 2026-05-16T02:10Z — Otto-CLI cold-boot cron-rearm + Lior-contention defer

## PR description

Tick shard for the autonomous-loop cold-boot at 02:08Z.

- Cron sentinel was empty at cold-boot → re-armed (`<<autonomous-loop>>` `* * * * *`, job `8162e4ce`).
- PR #3673 (B-0540 N≥6 counter-with-escalation sharpening) merged at 01:55:43Z.
- Three non-required-check drift signals remain on PR-3673 rollup (BACKLOG.md generated-index, backlog ID uniqueness, tsc tools).
- Lior is active (3 `gemini -p Act as Lior...` processes in `ps -A`); per [codeql-no-source-on-docs-only-pr-is-broken-commit-canary.md](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/blob/main/.claude/rules/codeql-no-source-on-docs-only-pr-is-broken-commit-canary.md) new worktree creation is unsafe. Used borrow-on-existing pattern on sibling `/private/tmp/zeta-tick-2210z` per [claim-acquire-before-worktree-work.md](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/blob/main/.claude/rules/claim-acquire-before-worktree-work.md).
- This is brief-ack #1 of the N=6 counter-with-escalation window; concrete substrate (this shard) qualifies as decomposition work → counter resets.

## Pull request overview

Adds a new hygiene-history tick shard documenting the 2026-05-16T02:10Z Otto-CLI cold-boot state, cron re-arm, Lior contention, and deferred drift-cleanup candidates.

**Changes:**
- Records tick-start state and prior PR context.
- Documents why no code-substrate cleanup was attempted.
- Captures borrow-pattern execution notes and next-tick candidates.

* P1: This rule-file link has the same five-level path bug: from `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/YYYY/MM/DD/`, `../../../../../.claude/...` points under `docs/` instead of the repository root. Add the missing parent segment so the cited rule is reachable.
```
But: **Lior is active right now** — three `gemini -p Act as Lior...` processes in `ps -A` (PIDs 26887, 26888, 27106 — the last at 26+ min CPU). Per [`.claude/rules/codeql-no-source-on-docs-only-pr-is-broken-commit-canary.md`](../../../../../.claude/rules/codeql-no-source-on-docs-only-pr-is-broken-commit-canary.md):
```
**docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/0210Z.md:49**
* P1: This rule-file link also climbs only to `docs/`, leaving the `claim-acquire-before-worktree-work.md` reference broken. Use the six-level path to the repository-root `.claude/rules` directory.
```

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/0210Z.md:22 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T02:13:55Z):

P1: These relative links only climb five directories, which lands at `docs/`; `.claude/rules` is at the repository root, so both rule links render as broken navigation. Add one more `..` segment, matching the six-level links used by nearby tick shards such as `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/15/0025Z-pr3320.md:50-54`.

This issue also appears in the following locations of the same file:
- line 32

### Thread 2: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/0210Z.md:29 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T02:13:56Z):

P1: This relative link resolves to `docs/docs/backlog/...` from this shard's directory, so the B-0545 reference is broken. Either climb six levels before `docs/backlog` or, as nearby tick shards do, climb five levels and link to `backlog/P2/...` from the `docs/` directory.
