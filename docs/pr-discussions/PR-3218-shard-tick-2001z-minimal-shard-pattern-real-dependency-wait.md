## Pull request overview

Adds a single tick-history shard documenting a minimal session-close tick that names PR #3217 as a real dependency and articulates the "minimal-shard pattern" for valid small ticks at session close.

**Changes:**
- New tick file under `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/` recording rate-limit, holding discipline, and minimal-scope rationale.
- Documents the minimal-shard pattern as a valid tick shape distinct from Standing-by-failure-mode.
