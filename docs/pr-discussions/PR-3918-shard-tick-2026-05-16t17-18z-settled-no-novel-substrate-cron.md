# PR #3918: shard(tick): 2026-05-16T17:18Z — settled; no novel substrate; cron continues

## PR description

## Summary

Settled tick after the 11-PR cron-tick-discipline cascade fully landed on main.

PR #3915 (1706Z settling) confirmed MERGED. Substantive backlog rows (B-0030 lint-with-exclusions extraction, B-0027 markdown-table fix tool, etc.) deferred to quieter peer-saturation windows where start-gate work + bounded-context contamination recovery overhead is lower.

No brief-acks; not in Standing-by. Single-observation tick.

## Test plan

- [x] \`bun tools/hygiene/audit-tick-shard-relative-paths.ts\` exit 0
- [x] Docs-only

## Pull request overview

Docs-only tick shard recording a settled state in the cron-tick discipline cascade, with no novel substrate this tick.

**Changes:**
- Add new tick shard at `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/1718Z.md` noting the 11-PR session arc has fully landed and explaining why substantive backlog work is deferred.
