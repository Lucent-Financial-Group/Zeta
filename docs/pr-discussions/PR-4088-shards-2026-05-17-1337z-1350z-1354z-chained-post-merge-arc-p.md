# PR #4088: shards(2026-05-17): 1337Z + 1350Z + 1354Z chained — post-merge arc (pure-git tier)

## PR description

## Substrate landing — 3 chained shards from post-merge arc

Three tick shards on one branch (single PR for batch):

- `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/17/1337Z.md` — peer-Otto 1327Z push (pure-git tier)
- `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/17/1350Z.md` — brief-ack #1 bounded named-dep
- `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/17/1354Z.md` — pushed peer B-0613 branch

Authored on `otto/1337z-shard-meta` (isolated worktree off main per `.claude/rules/zeta-expected-branch.md` race-window-caveat). Three commits across ~17 min of post-merge arc operating under pure-git tier (GraphQL ~140 → 0); deferred PR-create until rate-limit reset.
