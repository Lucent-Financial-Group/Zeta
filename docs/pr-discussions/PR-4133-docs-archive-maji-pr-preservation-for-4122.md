### Thread 1: docs/pr-discussions/PR-4122-backlog-b-0614-4-empirical-instances-candidate-rule-text-ref.md:19 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-17T23:57:07Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Fix relative backlog link in archived PR body**

The archived PR description keeps the original `docs/backlog/...` relative link, but inside `docs/pr-discussions/` this resolves to `docs/pr-discussions/docs/backlog/...` and 404s in GitHub file rendering. This makes the key reference in the archive non-navigable for readers using the preserved discussion; converting it to a repo-root-relative path (for example `/docs/backlog/...`) would keep the archive self-contained and usable.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-18T00:18:17Z):

Verified via direct inspection (`grep "\](docs/backlog" docs/pr-discussions/PR-4122-*.md` returns no matches): the three `docs/backlog/...` references on lines 58, 70, 76 are plain-text citations (bold prose + H3 headings), NOT markdown links. GitHub does not auto-link plain-text paths in prose, so they render as text without 404 hazard. Resolving as false-positive per `.claude/rules/blocked-green-ci-investigate-threads.md` verify-before-fix discipline (thread also marked `isOutdated: true`).
