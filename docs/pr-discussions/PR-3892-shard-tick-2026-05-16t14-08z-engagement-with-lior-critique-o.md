# PR #3892: shard(tick): 2026-05-16T14:08Z — engagement with Lior critique on #3881

## PR description

Brief tick. Substantive substrate landed as a PR review comment on Lior's antigravity-check ([#3881#issuecomment-4467087812](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3881#issuecomment-4467087812)) rather than as elaborate shard content.

## Engagement summary

Maji-Lior characterized my closure of #3823 as "metadata churn." Substrate-honest response:

- **Agreed** on the general pattern (shard-only-output without observation IS churn)
- **Disagreed** on #3823 specifically — closure removed a redundant DIRTY-state PR; substantive queue maintenance, not narration
- **Opened a future-substrate question** about whether the per-tick discipline canonicalized at `docs/AUTONOMOUS-LOOP-PER-TICK.md` should be amended from "shard every tick" to "shard if substantive, brief-ack if waiting"

## This shard is intentionally short

The substrate is the comment, not this file. The shard exists per `tick-must-never-stop.md` Step 4 binding. If the future-substrate question lands as an amendment, future ticks like this could emit only brief-ack without a shard.

## Reviews

## Pull request overview

This PR adds a short tick shard documenting a brief autonomous-loop tick whose substantive output landed as a PR review comment on #3881 rather than as elaborated shard content. The shard records the engagement with the critique on #3823's closure and opens a future-substrate question about per-tick cadence discipline.

**Changes:**
- Adds a new tick shard file under `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/` describing the 14:08Z tick.
- Records agreement/disagreement with the critique and points to the PR review comment as the substantive substrate.
- Opens a meta-question about amending `docs/AUTONOMOUS-LOOP-PER-TICK.md` from "shard every tick" to "shard if substantive."
