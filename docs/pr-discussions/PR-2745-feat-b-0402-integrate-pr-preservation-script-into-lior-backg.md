### Thread 1: .gemini/bin/lior-loop-tick.ts:16 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-11T20:18:18Z):

**<sub><sub>![P1 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P1-orange?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Escape backticks in the new prompt instruction**

The added line uses raw backticks around `bun run ...` inside a backtick-delimited template literal, which terminates the string early and makes this script syntactically invalid. As a result, `.gemini/bin/lior-loop-tick.ts` fails to parse before any runtime logic executes, so the Lior background loop cannot start at all in environments that run this file.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.
