# PR #3600: shard(tick): 2210Z — fresh cold-boot; cron re-armed; null actionable

## PR description

## Summary

- Fresh autonomous-loop cold-boot at 22:10Z; SessionStart hook caught empty `CronList` → armed `<<autonomous-loop>>` job `d97cdace`.
- Refresh: `origin/main` at `1818aaa` (PR #3598 decomposed migration merged 2 min before this tick).
- PR queue: 37 OPEN, 35 DIRTY-rebase-wait — normal post-merge-cascade state; bulk-rebase out of scope.
- PR #3590 (this primary worktree's branch) has 70 files vs #3598's 26 — left open; closing would discard ~44 files of unmerged scope.
- Lior-gemini ACTIVE during this tick (PIDs 73901/73902/74217); canary-rule risk window observed; pre/post-commit tree-size 52→52 (no corruption).
- Audit-first-then-decide → null actionable; plateau-shard precedent (2112Z, 2050Z, 2055Z, 2101Z) supports.

## Test plan

- [x] Pre-commit `git ls-tree HEAD | wc -l` = 52
- [x] Post-commit `git ls-tree HEAD | wc -l` = 52 (no Lior corruption)
- [x] Cron `d97cdace` armed and visible in CronList
- [x] Shard committed to fresh branch off origin/main (no contamination of #3590)
- [ ] Auto-merge to be armed by maintainer if shard-CI passes

## Pull request overview

Adds a single hygiene-history tick shard documenting the 22:10Z autonomous-loop cold boot, cron re-arming, PR queue state, active Lior risk disclosure, and null-actionable decision.

**Changes:**
- Adds a new `2210Z.md` tick record under `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/15/`.
- Captures cron state, queue survey, #3590/#3598 context, and commit-tree canary verification.
