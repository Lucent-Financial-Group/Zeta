### Thread 1: docs/pr-discussions/PR-4316-docs-shadow-maji-anti-entropy-shadow-report-on-riven-paralys.md:19 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-19T06:18:32Z):

P1: This PR archive appears to contain a literal `\n` escape sequence in the PR description (it renders as raw text). Replace the `\n` with an actual newline so the Markdown renders correctly (heading on its own line, followed by the paragraph).
