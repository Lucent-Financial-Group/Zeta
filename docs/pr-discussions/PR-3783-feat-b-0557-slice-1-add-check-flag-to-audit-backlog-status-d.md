# PR #3783: feat(B-0557 slice 1): add --check flag to audit-backlog-status-drift

## PR description

## Summary

- Adds `--check` flag to the audit-backlog-status-drift tool (smallest of [B-0557](docs/backlog/P3/B-0557-audit-backlog-status-drift-quality-improvements-2026-05-16.md)'s 4 follow-up slices).
- When `--check` is set and drift candidates exist, exits with code 65 — allows CI/cron jobs to fail the build on detected drift.
- Default behaviour unchanged (always exit 0 in detect-only mode).

## Test plan

- [x] Manual: `bun tools/hygiene/audit-backlog-status-drift.ts --check` exits non-zero when candidates present
- [x] Manual: without `--check`, behaviour identical to prior
- [x] Help text + `KNOWN_FLAGS` set updated
- [ ] CI wire-up (separate slice — adds a GitHub Action that runs `--check`)

## Composes with

- [B-0557](docs/backlog/P3/B-0557-audit-backlog-status-drift-quality-improvements-2026-05-16.md) — parent row (4 follow-up slices)
- [B-0553](docs/backlog/P3/B-0553-audit-backlog-status-drift-detection-2026-05-16.md) — the audit-tool spec
- [PR #3758](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3758) — original tool impl

* This workflow step says the B-0494 row was closed and BACKLOG regenerated, but those changes are not present in this PR: B-0494 remains open in its row file and in `docs/BACKLOG.md`. The shard should either include/land after the close-row update or avoid recording the close as completed.
```
5. **Close**: status: open → closed + Resolution section + BACKLOG.md regen
6. **Open PR**: [PR #3781](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3781) + arm auto-merge
```
**docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/0638Z.md:53**
* This visibility signal repeats that B-0494 was closed, but the reviewed tree still has B-0494 open. That makes the new history shard inconsistent with the repository state unless the close-row PR is merged first.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: tools/hygiene/audit-backlog-status-drift.ts:284 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T06:46:01Z):

The new `--check` exit path is only manually tested. This tool already has `tools/hygiene/audit-backlog-status-drift.test.ts`, but it does not exercise CLI parsing or the 65/0 behavior for `--check`, so the CI-facing contract can regress without an automated failure.

### Thread 2: tools/hygiene/audit-backlog-status-drift.ts:267 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T06:46:01Z):

The script header still documents only `--json` usage and exit codes 0/64. With this added `--check` mode, the file-level invocation/exit-code documentation is now stale and omits the 65 CI failure contract.

### Thread 3: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/0638Z.md:1 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T06:46:02Z):

This new tick shard starts with an H1, but the canonical shard schema requires the first line to be the single-row pipe record (`docs/hygiene-history/ticks/README.md:51-57`), and `tools/hygiene/check-tick-history-shard-schema.ts:52-104` validates that first non-empty line. Add the pipe-row header before the rich H1 body so new shards do not add to the known schema/practice drift tracked in B-0529.

### Thread 4: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/0638Z.md:8 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T06:46:02Z):

This records B-0494 as already closed via PR #3781, but in the reviewed tree B-0494 is still `status: open` and `docs/BACKLOG.md` still lists it as open. If the close-row PR is a separate branch, this shard should not land before that PR or it will introduce historical/status drift.

This issue also appears in the following locations of the same file:
- line 31
- line 53

### Thread 5: tools/hygiene/audit-backlog-status-drift.ts:255 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T06:46:02Z):

The unknown-argument usage string omits the supported help flags even though `--help` and `-h` are accepted. Keeping the error usage in sync with the full help text avoids hiding the way to discover valid options after a typo.
