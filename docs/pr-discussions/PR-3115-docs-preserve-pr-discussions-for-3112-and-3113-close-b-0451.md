### Thread 1: docs/backlog/P1/B-0451-duplicate-row-id-substrate-cleanup-2026-05-13.md:93 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T08:16:37Z):

This closes B-0451 while leaving one acceptance criterion unchecked. If CI wiring is no longer required for this row, move it out of the acceptance-criteria checklist and link/create the follow-up row; otherwise keep the backlog item open until the criterion is complete.

### Thread 2: docs/backlog/P1/B-0451-duplicate-row-id-substrate-cleanup-2026-05-13.md:5 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T08:16:37Z):

The PR title and description only describe preserving PR discussions for #3112/#3113, but this change also closes backlog item B-0451. Please either update the PR metadata to include the backlog closure or split this state change into a separate PR so reviewers can evaluate the scope accurately.
