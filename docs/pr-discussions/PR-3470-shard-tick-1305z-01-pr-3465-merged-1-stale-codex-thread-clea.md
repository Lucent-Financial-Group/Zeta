# PR #3470: shard(tick): 1305Z-01 — PR #3465 merged; 1 stale Codex thread cleared

## PR description

Cron-driven autonomous-loop tick. Filename uses disambig suffix because pre-recalibration drift collided with this actual UTC timestamp.

## Reviews

### COMMENTED — @copilot-pull-request-reviewer (2026-05-15T13:09:28Z)

## Pull request overview

Adds a new autonomous-loop tick shard documenting the 13:05Z tick (disambiguated as `1305Z-01` due to an existing `1305Z.md`), recording PR merge state and the resolution of a stale Codex review thread.

**Changes:**
- Added a new tick shard file for 2026-05-15 13:05Z (disambiguated `-01`) with the standard pipe-row header plus short bullet summary.
- Captured merge confirmation for PR #3465 and follow-up status for PRs #3466/#3467.
- Recorded the cron sentinel value for this tick.

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T13:09:28Z):

P1: Pipe-row PR reference is still `(PR TBD)`. Now that this PR number is known, update col 5 to the concrete `(PR #3470)` (or whatever the actual PR ID is) to keep shard rows mechanically traceable and avoid leaving placeholders in the canonical first line.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-15T13:14:06Z):

Stale review — main blob already has `| (PR #3470) |` (pre-merge fix commit `89e853a` per the post-create-fix discipline). Resolving.
