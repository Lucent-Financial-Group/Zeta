# PR #3763: chore(b-0533): add Status section confirming partial-completion (Slice B shipped, Slice A pending)

## PR description

Per row-close gate triage (PR #3757 step-0 discriminator): B-0533 is partial-completion, not drift. Slice B (lint tool + gate.yml) shipped via PR #3548 + #3555; Slice A (sweep) pending — lint check still failing on PRs #3670/#3659/#3643/#3633/#3599. Row stays status: open.

## Pull request overview

Adds a "Status (2026-05-16)" section to the B-0533 backlog row, documenting that — per the row-close gate's new step-0 substrate-drift discriminator (PR #3757) — the row is in partial-completion (Slice B lint tool + gate.yml job shipped via PRs #3548/#3555; Slice A persona-batched sweep still pending, evidenced by lint failures on PRs #3670/#3659/#3643/#3633/#3599). Row remains `status: open`.

**Changes:**
- Append a Status section distinguishing partial-completion from drift, with explicit Shipped/Pending breakdown
- Cite the audit anchor (pure-git verification that the tool exists and the gate.yml job is wired)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T06:03:10Z):

Frontmatter `last_updated` is still 2026-05-15 but this PR adds a new "## Status (2026-05-16)" section. Per tools/backlog/README.md, `last_updated` must be bumped on every content edit to a per-row file.
