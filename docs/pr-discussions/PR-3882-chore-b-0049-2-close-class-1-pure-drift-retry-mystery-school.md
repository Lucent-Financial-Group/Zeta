# PR #3882: chore(b-0049.2): close (class #1 pure drift; retry) — Mystery schools Mithraic Stage-1 scaffold shipped 2026-05-10

## PR description

Third actual close-row of the audit cycle. Audit-triage retry — first attempt (tick 10:27Z, branch `otto-cli-b0049.2-audit-2026-05-16-1029z`) aborted mid-flight due to peer-Otto session-close branch churn during two-step Edit tool calls.

## Deliverable verification

`docs/substrate-shelves/mystery-schools-mithraic.md`:
- 435 lines
- 141 domain-term mentions (mithra, tauroctony, cumont, roman, initiation)
- Proper backlog-linked frontmatter
- CATALOG-ONLY register preserved (filters F1/F2/F3 OFF)
- Stage-2 queue note present

**Class #1 (pure drift)** — file landed 2026-05-10 (frontmatter date matches row's filed date); row's `status: open` was never updated.

## Multi-Otto contamination + recovery

Single-shot Bash sed/heredoc avoided the multi-Edit-tool window that hit the contamination race the first time. But peer-Otto's worktree-switch during this commit's git operations still landed my fix commit on peer's branch label (`otto-cli-tick-2026-05-16-1310z`). Recovery: `git push origin <SHA>:refs/heads/<intended-branch>` to push the commit-by-SHA to the correct remote branch name.

The empirical pattern accumulating: when peer-Otto is highly active (33+ Lior procs + 8+ claude procs), single-shot Bash composability is necessary but not sufficient. SHA-push as final-fallback recovery handles the peer-worktree-switch race.

## Changes

- Frontmatter `status: open` → `status: closed`
- Resolution section appended (cites the recovery pattern)
- `docs/BACKLOG.md` regenerated via `BACKLOG_WRITE_FORCE=1 bun tools/backlog/generate-index.ts`

### Thread 1: docs/backlog/P2/B-0049.2-mystery-schools-stage1-mithraic-bibliographic-scaffold.md:4 (unresolved)

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Update last_updated when closing backlog row**

This change marks the row as `status: closed` and adds a new resolution section, but leaves `last_updated` at `2026-05-10`. The backlog schema says `last_updated` must be updated on every content edit, so this introduces stale metadata that can skew recency/age-based backlog tooling and audits for this item. Please bump `last_updated` to the closure edit date (here, `2026-05-16`) when closing the row.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

### Thread 2: docs/backlog/P2/B-0049.2-mystery-schools-stage1-mithraic-bibliographic-scaffold.md:74 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T13:40:39Z):

P1: This row now has a 2026-05-16 status/content edit, but its frontmatter `last_updated` still reads 2026-05-10. `tools/backlog/README.md:57-70` requires `last_updated` to be updated on every per-row content edit, so update the frontmatter date with this closure.

### Thread 3: docs/backlog/P2/B-0049.2-mystery-schools-stage1-mithraic-bibliographic-scaffold.md:77 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T13:40:39Z):

P2: The verification note says the deliverable has 435 lines, but the current repository file is reported as 436 lines. Keep this count in sync or drop the exact count so the closure evidence does not immediately drift.
