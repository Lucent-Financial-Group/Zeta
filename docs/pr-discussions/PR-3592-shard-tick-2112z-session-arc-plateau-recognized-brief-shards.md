## Pull request overview

Adds a new hygiene-history tick shard (2112Z) documenting that the current session arc has plateaued and that subsequent ticks should be brief “wait-state” acknowledgements until specific triggering conditions occur.

**Changes:**
- Introduces a new tick entry describing plateau recognition and the intended shorter shard format going forward.
- Records explicit criteria for when to resume substantive tick shards.
- Adds cross-references to the relevant memory file and `.claude/rules` guidance that motivates the change.
