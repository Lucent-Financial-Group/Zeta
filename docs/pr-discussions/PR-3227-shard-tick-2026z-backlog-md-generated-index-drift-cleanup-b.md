# PR #3227: shard(tick): 2026Z — BACKLOG.md generated-index drift cleanup (B-0517/B-0518/B-0519)

## PR description

## Summary

Tick 2026-05-14T20:26Z shard. Substantive work in [#3226](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3226) (BACKLOG.md regen — closes the drift warning surfaced by [#3221](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3221)).

## What landed

- [#3226](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3226) — regen of `docs/BACKLOG.md` adding B-0517/B-0518/B-0519 to the auto-generated index. Pure regen; no per-row file changes.
- This shard.

## Prior-tick PRs status

- [#3221](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3221) (chore(b-0502) launchd plist) — **MERGED** as `eb81404`. Closes B-0441 AC #2.
- [#3222](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3222) (shard 2010Z) — still wait-ci, autoMerge armed.

## Branch-state contamination — 2 new incidents this tick

Multi-Otto-one-checkout topology produced two more contamination patterns:

1. Between `git push` and `gh pr create`: HEAD detached at `origin/main` (parallel Otto's checkout). Worked around with re-`checkout`.
2. Second `gh pr create`: HEAD now on `fix/b-0518-sharpen-...` (a different Otto's branch). Worked around with `gh pr create --head <my-branch>` explicit flag.

## New defenses for future-Otto

- **`git branch --show-current` immediately before `git commit`** — primary catch for wrong-branch commits; survived this tick.
- **`gh pr create --head <my-branch>`** — explicit head ref prevents implicit current-branch from being poisoned by parallel checkouts.

The env-var-based `ZETA_EXPECTED_BRANCH` hook remains defense-in-depth only (env vars don't persist reliably across Bash-tool calls).

## Test plan

- [x] `git branch --show-current` confirmed before commit (correct branch)
- [x] `gh pr create --head` explicit ref
- [ ] CI clears
- [ ] Auto-merge

## Pull request overview

Tick shard file documenting the 2026-05-14T20:26Z autonomous-loop tick. Records the BACKLOG.md index-drift cleanup landed via #3226 and catalogs two new multi-Otto branch-state contamination incidents with their workarounds.

**Changes:**
- Adds a new tick-history file under `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/` per per-tick discipline
- Documents the BACKLOG.md drift investigation that surfaced B-0517/B-0518/B-0519 missing from the generated index
- Captures two new branch-contamination patterns and the `gh pr create --head` defense
