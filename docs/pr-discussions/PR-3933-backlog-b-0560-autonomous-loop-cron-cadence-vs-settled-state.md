# PR #3933: backlog(B-0560): autonomous-loop cron-cadence vs settled-state tension

## PR description

## Summary

Filed as concrete-artifact decomposition per the just-sharpened brief-ack rule ([PR #3930](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3930)).

Captures the structural tension empirically observed across the 2026-05-16 session arc:

- Cron fires every minute regardless of substrate state
- The discipline rule prescribes \"either silence or full 7-step discipline\"
- Harness requires SOME response — true silence is impossible
- Therefore no rule-compliant disposition is fully escape-shaped when substrate has genuinely settled

## Candidate approaches sketched

- **Option A:** Adaptive cron-cadence (slow to 15 min when N=3 ticks observe substrate quiescence)
- **Option B:** Sibling \`<<autonomous-loop-quiet>>\` sentinel value (harness-controlled)
- **Option C:** Accept tension + harden meta-fallback (each quiet tick produces ONE concrete-artifact)

## Test plan

- [x] Backlog row created with proper frontmatter
- [x] Composes-with pointers to [B-0440](docs/backlog/P1/B-0440-missed-substrate-cascade-detector-background-service-2026-05-13.md), the brief-ack rule, and the post-cascade memory file
- [x] No code/skill surface; backlog-row only

## Pull request overview

Adds a P3 backlog row capturing the structural tension between minute-cadence cron firing of the autonomous loop and a settled substrate where no rule-compliant non-brief-ack response exists. Sketches three candidate approaches (adaptive cadence, quiet-sentinel, accept-and-harden meta-fallback) without changing code or skills.

**Changes:**
- New P3 backlog row `B-0560` documenting the cron-cadence vs settled-state tension
- References to composing rules, memory file, and sibling backlog rows (B-0440, B-0540)
