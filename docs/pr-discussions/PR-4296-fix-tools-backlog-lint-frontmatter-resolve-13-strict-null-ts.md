# PR #4296: fix(tools/backlog/lint-frontmatter): resolve 13 strict-null TS errors blocking tsc-tools baseline lint

## PR description

## Summary

Fixes 13 TypeScript strict-null errors (TS2345 / TS2532 / TS2322 / TS18048) in `tools/backlog/lint-frontmatter.ts` that have been failing the `lint (tsc tools)` baseline check on origin/main for an unknown duration. This baseline failure has been propagating to all tools-touching PRs, blocking factory-wide merge throughput.

## Empirical evidence of impact

- [PR #3979](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3979) (gh-auth-refresh-wrapper fix): all 4 reviewer threads resolved, auto-merge armed, but stuck BLOCKED for >15 min after CI complete — diagnosed in [#3979 comment](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3979#issuecomment-4483555128) as likely blocked by this baseline
- Compare: docs-only PRs (#4255, #4256, #4276) shipped through this session within ~2 min of CI completion despite same baseline failure — protection rule treats `tools/` edits differently when this specific check fails
- Fixing this baseline unblocks a class of PRs, not just one

## Fix shape (all changes mechanical, no behavior change)

All 13 errors are `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true` (strict-null) failures from indexed array accesses and regex capture group dereferences. Two patterns applied:

**Pattern A — undefined guard before use** (3 locations: lines 124, 154, 175):
```ts
const line = lines[i];
if (line === undefined) continue;  // ADDED
// existing code unchanged
```

**Pattern B — non-null assertion on regex capture groups** (10 locations: lines 127, 128, 144, 159, 178, 187, 193):
```ts
const key = m[1]!;  // CHANGED from m[1]
```

Non-null is safe here because the regex literals have 1 or 2 explicit capture groups; if `.exec()` returns non-null, all declared capture groups exist.

## Landing path

Landed via GitHub REST contents API (`PUT /repos/.../contents/tools/backlog/lint-frontmatter.ts`) from an Otto-CLI session under dotgit-saturation, bypassing the B-0615 push receive-pack stall (see [PR #4276](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4276) for the rule documenting this pattern).

## Test plan

- [x] Diff verified — only the 13 error locations touched
- [x] No behavior change — only TS-type-narrowing additions
- [x] Same patterns used elsewhere in the codebase (`m[1]!` on regex capture groups is idiomatic when `.exec()` is non-null-checked)

### COMMENTED — @copilot-pull-request-reviewer (2026-05-19T01:13:31Z)

## Pull request overview

This PR mechanically updates `tools/backlog/lint-frontmatter.ts` to satisfy strict TypeScript nullability checks under `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, unblocking the tools TypeScript lint baseline without changing runtime behavior.

**Changes:**
- Added defensive `undefined` guards for indexed line reads.
- Added non-null assertions for regex capture groups after successful matches.
- Preserved existing backlog frontmatter lint logic.

## General comments

### @AceHack (2026-05-19T01:15:09Z)

## CI blocker discovered — `check docs/BACKLOG.md generated-index drift`

This PR's `lint (tsc tools)` fix would unblock the factory-wide baseline, but the PR itself is now blocked by a different baseline check: `check docs/BACKLOG.md generated-index drift`.

**Why this fires here**: the check appears to trigger on any PR touching `docs/backlog/` OR `tools/backlog/` paths. My edit is in `tools/backlog/lint-frontmatter.ts` (tooling for backlog frontmatter linting), which trips the path filter even though it doesn't change any backlog content.

**Same regen-class blocker as PR #4280** (which hit `check MEMORY.md generated-index drift` after editing `memory/CURRENT-otto.md`). Both checks require running a TS regen script locally and committing the regenerated index, which is blocked by the current dotgit-saturation (see [PR #4276](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4276) for full context).

**Recovery paths**:
1. **Aaron / substrate-engineer with healthy local git**: run `bun tools/backlog/generate-index.ts` (or equivalent), commit the regenerated `docs/BACKLOG.md`, push as follow-on commit on this branch — auto-merge fires after.
2. **Refine the drift check**: the check should ideally NOT fire on PRs that don't touch `docs/backlog/P*/B-*.md` files. Currently the path-trigger appears overbroad (catches `tools/backlog/` too). This is a separate substrate-engineering task.
3. **Manual merge override**: if the fix is urgent (it unblocks many other PRs), a maintainer can force-merge despite the drift; the regen will catch up on a later tick.

**Substrate is durable**: commit `647d2605` lands the 13 strict-null fixes on this PR branch regardless of merge status. The fix logic is correct and validated against the original `tools/backlog/lint-frontmatter.ts` error log; can be cherry-picked or applied via `git am` from `/tmp/zeta-pending-substrate-2347z/` family pattern.
