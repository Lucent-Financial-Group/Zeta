# PR #3363: shard(tick): 0517Z — bus hygiene + B-0529 filed + restraint discipline on B-0527 advisory

## PR description

## Summary

- Bus hygiene: cleaned expired `d2b7fc2f` (B-0527 republish #2)
- Filed B-0529 P2 row for tick-shard schema validator-vs-practice drift ([PR #3362](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3362))
- **Restraint discipline**: chose NOT to publish a third B-0527 advisory (two prior advisories went unactioned by Lior; third republish would be Holding-pattern failure mode). Auto-merge race will surface the conflict at merge-time anyway; backlog (B-0529) is now the durable substrate.
- Recovery-worktree-borrowing now 5 borrows on same `0027z-sidetick` worktree across 4 ticks; peer-Otto WIP preserved throughout.

## Test plan

- [x] `bun tools/hygiene/check-tick-history-shard-schema.ts` → 0 violations
- [x] `bun x markdownlint-cli2` → 0 violations
- [x] Pipe-row first line + H1-rich body (hybrid pattern per B-0529 recommendation)
- [x] Linked rule refs (`.claude/rules/holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure.md`, etc.)
- [ ] CI required checks pass on PR
- [ ] Auto-merge fires after CI green

## Pull request overview

Adds the 0517Z tick-history shard, recording bus cleanup, filing B-0529 for tick-shard schema validator drift, and the decision to stop republishing the B-0527 advisory (restraint discipline). This continues the hygiene-history “tick shard” event stream under `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/`.

**Changes:**
- Adds a new tick shard file for 2026-05-15 05:17Z with a pipe-row header plus an H1-rich body.
- Documents bus-envelope cleanup and current B-0527 collision status.
- Records the B-0529 backlog filing and links to relevant rule references.

* The relative link to `.claude/rules/additive-not-zero-sum.md` is broken for this shard location (it points under `docs/.claude/...`, which doesn’t exist). It should go up to repo root first (add one more `../`, consistent with other tick shards).
```
This composes with [`.claude/rules/additive-not-zero-sum.md`](../../../../../.claude/rules/additive-not-zero-sum.md): the substrate already preserves the finding (in 0043Z shard, in 0414Z shard, in B-0529 row referenced PR refs, in this shard). Constant republishing is zero-sum noise; substrate preservation is additive.

* The relative link to `.claude/rules/otto-channels-reference-card.md` is off by one directory level: `../../../../../.claude/...` resolves to `docs/.claude/...` from this file, but `.claude/` is at the repo root. Add one more `../` so the link resolves correctly.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/15/0517Z.md:9 (unresolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-15T05:24:32Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Fix relative paths to `.claude` rule links**

The rule references in this tick entry use `../../../../../.claude/...`, which from `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/15/` resolves to `docs/.claude/...` (non-existent), so the cited governance links are broken for readers. This undermines the traceability this shard relies on, because reviewers cannot open the referenced rule documents directly from the report; the links need one more `..` segment to reach repo root.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

### Thread 2: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/15/0517Z.md:9 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T05:26:38Z):

The relative link to `.claude/rules/holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure.md` is broken: from this shard path (`docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/15/0517Z.md`) `../../../../../` resolves to `docs/`, but `.claude/` lives at repo root. Use one more `../` (match other shards in this directory that link via `../../../../../../.claude/...`).
