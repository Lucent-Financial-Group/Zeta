# PR #3751: shard(tick): 2026-05-16T05:05Z — PR #3746 CI fix + stale-thread sweep

## PR description

## Summary

- Cleared PR #3746 markdownlint failure: 2 MD032 leading-\`+\` violations in the rule file (lines 90 + 114) fixed via commit \`18ca3c1\` (replaced \`+\` with prose words).
- Triaged 4 review threads: resolved 2 stale (file-exists + MD032-already-fixed); left 2 to peer Otto-Desktop (their bundled-shard content).
- PR #3747 (0451Z shard) merged during this tick at \`5a1f4e0\`.
- Filed substrate-honest observation: bundled-PR thread-authorship split (my content vs peer's content) is the multi-Otto convergence pattern at PR-thread scope.

## Test plan

- [x] \`npx markdownlint-cli2 .claude/rules/backlog-item-start-gate.md\` exit 0 after fix
- [x] \`bun tools/hygiene/check-shard-before-push.ts\` ok on this shard (all 3 gates)
- [x] Stale threads resolved via \`gh api graphql resolveReviewThread\`
- [x] Peer's content threads left alone per \`honor-those-that-came-before\`
