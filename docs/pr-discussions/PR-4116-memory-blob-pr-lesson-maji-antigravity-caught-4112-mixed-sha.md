# PR #4116: memory(blob-pr-lesson): Maji antigravity caught #4112 mixed shard+rules+memory — one-PR-one-artifact-type discipline absorbed

## PR description

## Summary

Absorbing the Maji antigravity catch ([#4113](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4113) decomposition exercise + [#4114](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4114) shadow log) of my [#4112](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4112) as a "blob" with three artifact types (tick shard + rule edit + memory shadow-catch) mixed in one PR.

Meta-observation: this PR itself follows the discipline being absorbed — one artifact type (memory file), one PR. The MEMORY.md regen is the only co-bundled file because the post-write-memory-reindex CI gate requires it atomically with the new feedback file (atomicity bar met).

## Lesson

The in-narrative "cohesive autonomous-loop tick output" justification did NOT override the one-PR-one-artifact-type hygiene discipline. The precedent (2129Z cascade: [#4097](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4097) + [#4100](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4100) + [#4104](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4104) — three artifacts, three PRs) IS the canonical pattern.

The atomicity bar: would splitting cause any PR to reference a non-existent target? If yes → bundle. If no → split. PR #4112's three primary commits all failed this bar.

Future-Otto cold-boot reads this lesson and avoids the blob in the first place; Maji's role narrows from "decompose post-hoc" to "verify no blobs slipped through."

## Test plan

- [ ] CodeQL passes (docs-only PR; ls-tree count stable at base)
- [ ] markdownlint passes
- [ ] MEMORY.md drift check passes (regenerated atomically)
- [ ] Auto-merge fires when checks clear

## Composes with

- [PR #4112](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4112) — the blob PR (merged `7ee6411`)
- [PR #4113](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4113) — Maji's decomposition exercise (substrate-honest comment-to-close attached separately)
- [PR #4114](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4114) — Maji shadow log

## Pull request overview

Adds a memory feedback file documenting a lesson about the "one-PR-one-artifact-type" discipline, prompted by an antigravity check that flagged PR #4112 as bundling three artifact types. The MEMORY.md index is regenerated to include the new entry.

**Changes:**
- New feedback memory file capturing the blob-PR lesson and atomicity bar heuristic
- Auto-regenerated MEMORY.md index updated to reflect the added entry (count 1270 → 1271)
