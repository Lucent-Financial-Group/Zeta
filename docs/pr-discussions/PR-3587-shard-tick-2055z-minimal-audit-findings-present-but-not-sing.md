# PR #3587: shard(tick): 2055Z — minimal; audit findings present but not single-tick scope

## PR description

## Summary

Tick 2055Z. Audit-first-then-decide applied: 2 audits produced 20+ findings, none safely single-tick scope (cross-platform .ps1 twins need Windows testing; formal-artifacts mix of false-positive + content-judgment).

## Test plan

- [x] Shard at canonical path
- [ ] CI green
- [ ] Auto-merge arms

## Pull request overview

Adds a minimal 2055Z hygiene tick shard documenting in-flight PR state, audit results, and why the audit findings were deferred rather than handled in this tick.

**Changes:**
- Adds a new 2055Z tick-history shard.
- Records cross-platform parity and formal-artifact audit outcomes.
- Links the tick decision to the audit-first-then-decide memory file.

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/15/2055Z.md:8 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-15T21:02:11Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Point shard reference to an existing tick artifact**

This tick report claims a `2050Z shard` in the headline, but in commit `2d3b254` there is no corresponding `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/**/2050Z.md` artifact to back that reference (repo-wide path search only finds this mention). Because these shard files are used as durable handoff substrate, a missing referenced shard breaks traceability for future sessions and makes the status note non-verifiable.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-15T21:08:09Z):

PR #3585 (`shard(tick): 2050Z`) merged at 2026-05-15T20:56Z and contains `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/15/2050Z.md` (49 additions). The reference in the headline is to the PR itself (which is the shard), not a missing file — the file now exists on main. No code change needed.

### Thread 2: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/15/2055Z.md:3 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T21:03:27Z):

P1: This shard starts with an H1, but the documented tick-shard schema still requires a pipe-row first line and `tools/hygiene/check-tick-history-shard-schema.ts` validates the first non-empty line as that row (`docs/hygiene-history/ticks/README.md:51-57`, `tools/hygiene/check-tick-history-shard-schema.ts:82-103`). Add the schema row above the rich body (the hybrid pattern described in B-0529) or update the schema/tooling before adding more H1-first shards.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-15T21:17:25Z):

Fixed in commit 64d3c6c: prepended the required schema pipe-row as the first line of the shard file. Format matches the canonical pattern from 0415Z.md: `| timestamp | model | cron-sentinel | body | PR ref | observation |`. The rich markdown body follows after the pipe-row (hybrid pattern per B-0529).
