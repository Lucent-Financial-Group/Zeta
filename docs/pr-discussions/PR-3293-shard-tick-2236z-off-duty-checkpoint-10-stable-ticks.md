# PR #3293: shard(tick): 2236Z — off-duty checkpoint (10+ stable ticks)

## PR description

## Summary

- Checkpoint shard after 10+ stable observational ticks (22:23Z–22:35Z)
- All prior shard PRs from this off-duty window merged cleanly
- Cadence self-paced from ~1/min down to zero (correct stable-state behavior)
- Breaks the aggregate-Holding pattern with substantive substrate per `holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure.md`

## Why this shard exists

A 1-hour zero-shard stretch would look indistinguishable from a dead loop in tick-history archaeology. A periodic checkpoint distinguishes "stable off-duty" from "broken loop."

## Test plan

- [x] Branch verified before commit (ZETA_EXPECTED_BRANCH)
- [x] Single file added (`docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/2236Z.md`)
- [x] Auto-merge will arm post-create

## Pull request overview

Adds a hygiene-history tick checkpoint documenting the stable off-duty state and why a periodic shard distinguishes intentional quiet from a stalled loop.

**Changes:**
- Adds a new 22:36Z tick-history checkpoint.
- Records off-duty dependency state, cadence observations, and visibility notes.
- Notes a stale local untracked file as observational context.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/2236Z.md:33 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T22:38:33Z):

The table says this window shipped 9 shards, but the parenthesized list contains 11 shard IDs. Please correct either the count or the list so the historical record is internally consistent.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-14T22:41:48Z):

Fixed: updated the count from '9 shards' to '11 shards' to match the 11 enumerated IDs (2209, 2211, 2212, 2213, 2215, 2216, 2217, 2218, 2219, 2221, 2222). Commit c89598e9.

### Thread 2: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/2236Z.md:33 (resolved)

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Correct shard count to match enumerated shard IDs**

Update this table row so the numeric count matches the listed shard IDs: it currently says `9 shards` while enumerating 11 IDs (`2209` through `2222` with gaps). This inconsistency makes the cadence checkpoint internally contradictory and can mislead later tick-history analysis about queue saturation and off-duty pacing.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.
