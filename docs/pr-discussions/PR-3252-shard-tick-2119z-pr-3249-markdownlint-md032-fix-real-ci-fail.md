# PR #3252: shard(tick): 2119Z — PR #3249 markdownlint MD032 fix (real CI failure)

## PR description

## Summary

Tick 2026-05-14T21:19Z shard. Substantive work was a real CI failure fix on [#3249](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3249): `lint (markdownlint)` flagged MD032 (blanks-around-lists) on the 2108Z shard. Copilot's auto-review caught the same issue in parallel.

## What landed

- **Commit `910067d` on PR [#3249](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3249)'s branch** — adds blank line after `Fix:` so MD032 is satisfied. Thread resolved with reply pointing to the fix.
- This shard.

## Defense-in-depth caught it twice

CI (`lint (markdownlint)`) + Copilot (auto-review) flagged the same line independently. Both pointed at `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/2108Z.md:32` where a list followed immediately after a `Fix:` paragraph without the required blank line.

## Proactive sweep result

`markdownlint-cli2 docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/2*.md` on `origin/main` exits 0. All other today's shards (2010Z, 2026Z, 2030Z, 2034Z, 2046Z, 2055Z, 2059Z, 2103Z, 2113Z) are clean.

## Pattern codified

When a section heading or paragraph is followed immediately by a list (e.g., `Fix:` → `- item`), MD032 requires a blank line between them. Pattern: `Section:` + blank line + list.

## Prior-tick PRs merged this batch
