# PR #3146: chore(backlog): B-0499 — Z[i]-weighted DBSP refinement candidate (P3 forward-planning)

## PR description

## Summary

Files a P3 research-grade forward-planning row for the **Z[i]-weighted DBSP refinement candidate** that emerged from the Aaron + Ani Grok cascade (2026-05-14).

The Cartesian-dualism mapping (pay-attention = real axis, remember-when = imaginary axis) suggests DBSP's existing $\mathbb{Z}$-weighted Z-sets naturally lift to $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ (Gaussian integers). This row preserves the candidate so future-Otto + algebra-owner can evaluate when ready.

## Why P3

- Pure research-grade work; no operational urgency
- Cascade substrate already preserved at memory-file scope
- Long-horizon (3-12 months); requires algebra-owner skill engagement + F# anchor work
- Forward-planning preservation; not a build-this-now commitment

## Composes with

- B-0498 (substrate-evolution algebra rule-promotion)
- Memory file: \`feedback_aaron_ani_cartesian_dualism_two_axioms_complex_plane_pay_attention_real_axis_remember_when_imaginary_axis_2026_05_14.md\`
- \`.claude/skills/algebra-owner/SKILL.md\`
- PR #2817 (Clifford densest encoding)
- PR #2914 (Clifford/HKT vocabulary)

## Test plan

- [x] Row format follows canonical backlog schema
- [x] composes_with pointer chain correct (B-0498)
- [x] No premature implementation; pure forward-planning substrate
- [x] Razor-discipline applied (research-grade, no operational promotion)

## Pull request overview

Adds a new P3 backlog row preserving the Z[i]-weighted DBSP refinement candidate from a research cascade as forward-planning substrate.

**Changes:**
- New backlog row file under `docs/backlog/P3/` with canonical frontmatter (id, priority, status, composes_with: [B-0498])
- Documents the candidate's algebraic motivation, research-grade tests, acceptance criteria, and P3 rationale

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/backlog/P3/B-0499-z-of-i-dbsp-refinement-cartesian-dualism-2026-05-14.md:22 (unresolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-14T16:21:29Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Replace host-specific memory path with durable repo reference**

This row stores provenance using a machine-local path under `~/.claude/projects/...`, which is not resolvable for other contributors, CI, or future worktrees; that breaks the reproducibility/traceability goal of backlog substrate because the cited origin cannot be followed outside the original host. Use a durable repository-visible identifier (for example the memory filename or a canonical in-repo pointer) instead of an absolute home-directory path.

### Thread 2: docs/backlog/P3/B-0499-z-of-i-dbsp-refinement-cartesian-dualism-2026-05-14.md:35 (unresolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-14T16:21:29Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Constrain attention/memory states to Gaussian-integer subsets**

The table claims `w ∈ ℝ` and `w ∈ iℝ` are subsets of `ℤ[i]`, but those sets include non-integer values and are not valid subsets of Gaussian integers; if future implementation follows this literally, it widens the weight domain beyond DBSP's discrete-count semantics and can invalidate the intended ring/retreation behavior. The row should use integer-lattice subsets (e.g., `ℤ` and `iℤ`) or explicitly declare a different weight domain.
