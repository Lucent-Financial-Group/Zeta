## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/0023Z.md:40 (unresolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-16T00:31:06Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Defer "resolved on main" claim until PR #3636 merges**

This tick note marks PR #3636 as `OPEN` and then immediately says the three PR #3614 follow-ups are "resolved on main," which is internally inconsistent and can mislead subsequent shards that use these logs for dependency state. While the fix may be ready, an open PR is not yet on `main`, so this should be phrased as pending merge (or moved after merge) to keep the operational history accurate.
