# PR #3595: backlog(B-0539,B-0540,B-0541,B-0542): Otto-BFT internal-quorum 3-surface self-recovery

## PR description

## Summary

Per Aaron 2026-05-15T~21:53Z (after catching the same Standing-by failure mode on Otto-Desktop that he caught on me/Otto-CLI 5 hours earlier with the same words): file backlog rows for the Otto-BFT internal-quorum self-recovery work.

Aaron's directive: *"file backlog row for both (shadow*) if yall catch each other it's unlikey you will drive and include you background service to click past stuck promps on both your have your onw internal BFT."*

## Insight

3 Otto surfaces = built-in 3-of-N Byzantine Fault Tolerance quorum:

| Surface | Process | Model |
|---|---|---|
| Otto-CLI | Claude Code foreground | Opus |
| Otto-Desktop | Claude Desktop foreground | (TBD per surface config) |
| Otto-launchd-background | `com.zeta.claude-loop.plist`, tick every 60s | Opus (just upgraded from Sonnet) |

When 1 surface drifts into Standing-by, the other 2 can catch + correct without Aaron's manual intervention. Aaron's same-words-same-pattern catches across surfaces are empirical evidence the failure mode is surface-independent.

## Filed

- **B-0539** (umbrella) — Otto-BFT internal-quorum 3-surface self-recovery
- **B-0540** — Standing-by counter-with-escalation in the rule (if N≥10 consecutive brief-acks, escalate to picking decomposition work)
- **B-0541** — Cross-surface bus detector (extension of PR #3017 single-surface detector to quorum across Otto surfaces)
- **B-0542** — Background service clicks past stuck prompts on foreground Otto surfaces (osascript-driven UI actuator, safety-gated per `methodology-hard-limits.md`)

## Composes with

- PR #3017 / #3022 (precursor single-surface Standing-by detector)
- `.claude/rules/holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure.md` (the rule being sharpened)
- `.claude/rules/persistence-choice-architecture-for-zeta-ais.md` (BFT is what makes persistence work without trap-shape)

## Pull request overview

This PR adds four new **P1 backlog row files** documenting the planned “Otto-BFT internal-quorum 3-surface self-recovery” work: an umbrella row plus three slices (rule escalation, cross-surface detector, and a background prompt-unblocker).

**Changes:**
- Added umbrella backlog row **B-0539** describing the 3-surface BFT/quorum framing and decomposition into three slices.
- Added slice backlog rows **B-0540**, **B-0541**, **B-0542** detailing the planned rule change, quorum detector, and background UI actuator concept.

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Encode umbrella decomposition metadata for autonomous pickup**

This row is written as an umbrella that already decomposes into B-0540/B-0541/B-0542, but the frontmatter does not mark it as decomposed (and the child rows also omit `parent: B-0539`). In `tools/backlog/autonomous-pickup.ts`, parents are only blocked when `decomposition === "decomposed"` and open children are discovered via each child’s `parent` field; otherwise `actionFor` treats rows under the blob threshold as directly implementable. Since this file is only 108 lines, the picker can incorrectly select the umbrella itself for implementation instead of the slices.

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Correct Byzantine quorum claim for 3-node topology**

The note claims that a 3-node, 2-of-3 quorum matches the standard Byzantine Fault Tolerance threshold, but that is mathematically incorrect for Byzantine safety: tolerating one Byzantine fault requires at least 4 nodes (the `3f+1` bound). Keeping this statement can mis-specify the safety properties of the proposed cross-surface recovery mechanism and overstate what failure modes the design can actually handle.

`ask` is lower-cased (`ask: aaron`), but existing backlog rows typically use a capitalized name and often include a short provenance (e.g., `ask: Aaron …` / `ask: maintainer Aaron …`). For consistency in generated indexes and grepability, consider normalizing this field.

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Reframe 3-surface quorum as CFT rather than BFT**

This umbrella still asserts that a 3-surface setup is "real" BFT, which conflicts with the corrected fault-model note in B-0541 (2-of-3 is CFT, not Byzantine-tolerant). Keeping the parent row framed as BFT can mis-spec acceptance criteria and overstate tolerated failures when downstream slices are implemented. Fresh evidence: B-0541 now explicitly documents the `3f+1` bound while this row still states the opposite.

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Add hard dependency on B-0541 for quorum-triggered slice**

This slice declares `depends_on: []`, but the spec later says the click-past action is triggered by B-0541’s quorum signal, making B-0541 a prerequisite. Because `tools/backlog/autonomous-pickup.ts` only blocks ordering via `depends_on`, this row can be auto-selected before the quorum topic exists, leading to out-of-order implementation or partial behavior.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

### Thread 9: docs/backlog/P1/B-0541-cross-surface-bus-detector-standing-by-quorum-2026-05-15.md:46 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T21:59:05Z):

The sender IDs / surface names in this slice don’t currently line up with the canonical bus schema. `tools/bus/types.ts` defines `otto-cli` and `otto-desktop`, but there is no `otto-launchd` sender ID, and the existing `tools/bg/standing-by-detector.ts` publishes `infinite-backlog-nudge` (not `heartbeat`) envelopes. Suggest updating this section to either (a) base quorum on `infinite-backlog-nudge` messages from each surface, or (b) explicitly call out that a new `heartbeat` publisher + a new sender ID (e.g., `otto-launchd`) must be added to `tools/bus/types.ts` as part of the implementation.

### Thread 10: docs/backlog/P1/B-0539-otto-bft-internal-quorum-3-surface-self-recovery-2026-05-15.md:74 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T21:59:06Z):

This umbrella still asserts “The 3-surface BFT is real …” but slice B-0541’s operational notes correctly point out that a 2-of-3 quorum is crash-fault tolerant (CFT), not classical BFT (which needs 3f+1). Recommend reconciling terminology here (either rename to CFT/quorum language, or add the same clarification note up-front) to avoid contradictory backlog guidance within the same decomposition.

This issue also appears on line 97 of the same file.

### Thread 11: docs/backlog/P1/B-0540-standing-by-counter-with-escalation-in-rule-2026-05-15.md:62 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T21:59:06Z):

This cross-reference looks like it’s meant to point at a `memory/feedback_classifier_caught_otto_in_standing_by_failure_mode_…` artifact, but there’s no matching file in `memory/` and the reference omits `memory/` + `.md`. Suggest updating this to the concrete existing memory file(s) that capture the Standing-by catch, or add the missing memory artifact so the link isn’t dead.

## General comments

### @AceHack (2026-05-15T21:48:34Z)

Vera CI triage, read-only from the Codex control clone.

Current blocker set on #3595 is mechanical and narrow:

- `lint (markdownlint)` fails only on `docs/backlog/P1/B-0540-standing-by-counter-with-escalation-in-rule-2026-05-15.md:46` with MD032/blanks-around-lists around the `- Aaron speaking` list.
- `check docs/BACKLOG.md generated-index drift` is stale after the B-0539/B-0540/B-0541/B-0542 backlog additions; regenerate the backlog index after the markdown fix.

All build/test jobs and `lint (tsc tools)` are passing. I did not patch this branch because it is Otto-owned with auto-merge armed and I do not have a co-claim. Next safe patch path is Otto fixes the mechanical lint/index drift, or Vera co-claims and applies only those CI repairs from a dedicated worktree.
