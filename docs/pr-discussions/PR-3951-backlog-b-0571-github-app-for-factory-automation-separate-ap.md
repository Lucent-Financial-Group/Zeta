# PR #3951: backlog(B-0571): GitHub App for factory automation — separate API rate-limit pool

## PR description

## Summary

Sibling row to [B-0570](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3950) (scarcity tracker). Primary capacity-mitigation for the per-user GitHub API saturation flagged today. Files the design row for a "Zeta-Factory" GitHub App installation on the LFG repo, with installation-token auth replacing PAT auth for automated agent work.

## Why

GitHub Apps have separate rate-limit pools designed for automation (vs the shared per-user 5000/hr bucket that saturated today across 3-4 concurrent agents). Plus clean \`[bot]\` attribution. Plus least-privilege permissions scope.

Per the mitigation-axes table in B-0570: this is the substrate-honest primary mitigation. Tier audit (B-0572) is the cheaper test (free 3× if LFG is already Enterprise); App is the architectural answer.

## Diff

- \`docs/backlog/P2/B-0571-*.md\` (118 lines) — design row with origin, acceptance criteria, 7-slice decomposition, design sketch, alternatives comparison, composes-with, substrate-honest caveats, open questions
- \`docs/BACKLOG.md\` (+1 line) — generated index updated

## Acceptance highlights

- App created in LFG org with least-privilege permissions
- \`tools/auth/get-installation-token.ts\` — JWT signing + installation token fetch
- Token-rotation logic (~1hr expiry)
- Migration: Otto bg worker + Lior antigravity loop switch to App auth
- Tracker (B-0570) reports App + user pools separately

## Composes with

- B-0570 (scarcity tracker)
- B-0572 (LFG tier audit — sibling mitigation)
- \`methodology-hard-limits.md\` (App permissions must be least-privilege)

## Pull request overview

Files a P2 backlog row designing a "Zeta-Factory" GitHub App installation to give automated agents a separate API rate-limit pool from human-user PATs, as a primary mitigation for the shared-bucket saturation surfaced in sibling row B-0570.

**Changes:**
- Adds `docs/backlog/P2/B-0571-*.md` design row with acceptance criteria, 7-slice decomposition, design sketch, alternatives table, and open questions.
- Updates `docs/BACKLOG.md` generated index with the new B-0571 entry under P2.
