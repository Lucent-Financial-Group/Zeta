# PR #3666: fix(hygiene): clear all 22 dead §33 migration xrefs (perpetual non-required-check)

## PR description

## Summary

The `lint (§33 migration xrefs)` check has been firing as a non-required failure on **every PR this session** (PRs #3626, #3628, #3631, #3636, #3639, #3641, #3646, #3647, #3650, #3652, #3653, #3654, #3657, #3661, #3662, #3663). Root cause: the `docs/research/` → `memory/persona/otto/conversations/` migration ([B-0533](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/blob/main/docs/backlog/P1/B-0533-section-33-migration-xrefs-audit-script-and-ci-gate-2026-05-15.md)) left 22 dead references across 18 files.

**Mechanical bulk fix**: 12 unique target filenames substituted in-place in 18 source files. Each substitution is `docs/research/<NAME>.md` → `memory/persona/otto/conversations/<NAME>.md` for a SPECIFIC filename (no blanket replacement of `docs/research/` — only the 12 known-migrated filenames).

**Verification**:

- `bun tools/hygiene/audit-section-33-migration-xrefs.ts --enforce` was **22 dead xrefs** before this commit, **0 dead xrefs** after
- Pure-substitution diff: **+22/-22**, no content changes
- All 12 target files verified to exist in `memory/persona/otto/conversations/`
- ls-tree canary clean (53/53 root entries)

## Files changed

18 files changed, 22 insertions(+), 22 deletions(-)

- 9 memory/feedback_*.md
- 1 memory/CURRENT-aaron.md
- 1 memory/user_*.md
```

## Remaining drift

The other 4 perpetual non-required-check failures remain:

- `lint (backlog ID uniqueness)` — B-0498 collision already scoped at [B-0545](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/blob/main/docs/backlog/P2/B-0545-b0498-collision-renumber-sweep-2026-05-15.md)
- `lint (tsc tools)` — needs separate investigation
- `check docs/BACKLOG.md generated-index drift` — needs regen pass
- `check MEMORY.md generated-index drift` — needs regen pass

## Test plan

- [x] `audit-section-33-migration-xrefs.ts --enforce` returns 0 dead xrefs (was 22)
- [x] Pure-substitution property: 12 sed expressions, each scoped to a specific filename
- [x] Pre/post-commit ls-tree canary clean (53/53; Lior gone)
- [ ] CI green (docs-only; expect `lint (§33 migration xrefs)` to FLIP from fail → pass)

### COMMENTED — @copilot-pull-request-reviewer (2026-05-16T01:28:11Z)

## Pull request overview

This PR fixes the perpetual `lint (§33 migration xrefs)` failure by updating stale cross-references that still point at `docs/research/<NAME>.md` to instead point at the migrated archive location `memory/persona/otto/conversations/<NAME>.md`.

**Changes:**
- Updated 22 xrefs across memory files, backlog rows, and a `.claude/rules` doc to the post-migration archive paths.
- Kept changes scoped to specific known-migrated filenames (no blanket `docs/research/` rewrite).
- Updated `memory/CURRENT-aaron.md` and related memos to reference the new archived conversation paths.
