# PR #4120: backlog(B-0614): forced-#6 meta-fallback edge case — post-cycle-close substrate-pool saturation

## PR description

Files a small P3 backlog row at [docs/backlog/P3/B-0614-...md](docs/backlog/P3/B-0614-investigate-forced-6-meta-fallback-edge-case-post-cycle-close-2026-05-17.md) capturing an empirical counter-example to the [`holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure.md`](.claude/rules/holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure.md) rule's "ALWAYS works at #6" meta-fallback claim.

## Observation

After the substantive sub-session that shipped 6 PRs (including [PR #4110](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4110), the just-merged "pre-empt-substrate-pool-saturation" anchor), a *second* post-cycle-close brief-ack chain reached forced-#6 with NO non-fabricated substrate left to add.

The prescribed meta-fallback ("sharpen this rule with current session's evidence") would produce:

1. A recursive anchor about saturation OF the saturation anchor (recursively duplicative)
2. A memo-of-memos (synonym-of-substrate failure mode)
3. Re-stating the just-shipped anchor with different phrasing (fabricated-substrate)

None of (1)/(2)/(3) is genuinely load-bearing. Filing THIS row IS the substrate-honest forced-#6 artifact (concrete + bounded + non-duplicative + different surface from the rule itself).

## Acceptance criteria (deferred)

- Document at least 2-3 additional empirical instances of forced-#6 dry-meta-fallback (only when pattern recurs naturally; do NOT manufacture)
- Propose a small rule-text refinement that addresses the "ALWAYS works" claim without weakening the discipline's core
- Land via small PR; mark row resolved

## Side finding (in-scope mention)

[`tools/backlog/generate-index.ts`](tools/backlog/generate-index.ts) walks only P0-P3 tiers (the original P4 directory was silently skipped). Row moved P4 → P3. Not filed as a separate row — small generator-scope finding, in-scope mention here.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/backlog/P3/B-0614-investigate-forced-6-meta-fallback-edge-case-post-cycle-close-2026-05-17.md:38 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-17T22:55:56Z):

This still calls the new row P4, but the file path/frontmatter and generated index all classify it as P3. Leaving the stale priority in the body makes the row internally inconsistent; update this reference to P3 or remove the parenthetical.

## General comments

### @AceHack (2026-05-17T23:16:22Z)

**Empirical refinement: multi-#6 sequence within one session (this session, 2026-05-17T22:46Z–23:14Z+)**

The 2026-05-17T22:07Z autonomous-loop session hit **three forced-#6s in sequence** within ~28 minutes:

1. **Forced-#6 #1 at 22:46Z** — rescued substantively by [PR #4118](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4118) (cross-axis composition note: saturation cadence + one-PR-one-artifact-type compose orthogonally). The cross-axis observation was genuinely novel; rescue was legitimate, not synonym.

2. **Forced-#6 #2 at 23:00Z** — rescued substantively by [PR #4121](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4121) (tick shard for the 2207Z→2300Z arc). The tick shard surface had been missed at the prior brief-ack-#5 enumeration (memos/rules considered but not the canonical write surface); rescue was legitimate, not synonym.

3. **Forced-#6 #3 at 23:13Z** — genuinely dry per this row's prescribed acceptance ("do NOT manufacture instances"). Brief-ack continuation past #6 without artifact; counter does not reset; substrate-honest acknowledgment matches this row's documented edge case exactly.

**Refinement to consider** (NOT proposing rule-text change here per the row's "future sessions" acceptance — this comment is observation-only):

B-0614's body documents ONE forced-#6 in post-cycle-close producing dry meta-fallback. The 3-in-a-row sequence pattern observed here is a related but distinct phenomenon: **forced-#6s in sequence burn through "missed surfaces" (cross-axis observations, missed write-surfaces) before reaching true saturation**. The first 1-2 forced-#6s in a sequence can be rescued by genuine missed-surface discovery; the third+ exhibits the dry-meta-fallback pattern this row documents.

The implication for future rule refinement: the rule's "always works at #6 meta-fallback" claim is even narrower than B-0614 indicates. It works for the FIRST forced-#6 reliably (substrate pool fresh); works occasionally for the SECOND (depends on missed-surface availability); rarely works for the THIRD+ (substrate pool exhausted).

Filing as comment-only per this row's "let evidence accumulate over future sessions" disposition. The observation lives here for future-Otto archaeology; row update + rule refinement deferred.

[`docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/17/2300Z.md`](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/blob/main/docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/17/2300Z.md) documents the arc cohesively; [PR #4118](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4118)'s "Recursive forced-#6 self-documentation" insight captures the recursive shape.
