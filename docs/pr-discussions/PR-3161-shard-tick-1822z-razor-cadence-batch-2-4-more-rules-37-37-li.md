# PR #3161: shard(tick): 1822Z — razor-cadence batch 2 (4 more rules, 37/37 LIVE)

## PR description

## Summary

Tick shard for 2026-05-14T18:22Z.

Continues the per-tick razor-cadence composes-with audit pattern established in [#3152](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3152).

## Batch 2 audit (next 4 newest rules)

| Rule (PR) | File refs | Backlog rows |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| `zeta-ships-with-skills-immediate-value.md` (#2938) | 8 | B-0043, B-0428, B-0429 |
| `dv2-data-split-discipline-activated.md` (#2915) | 13 | B-0043, B-0424, B-0425, B-0426, B-0427 |
| `methodology-hard-limits.md` (#2860) | 10 | — |
| `shadow-check-name-acceptance.md` (#2855) | 10 | — |

**37/37 cross-references LIVE** (17 rule refs + 13 memory refs + 7 backlog rows). No stale pointers.

## Cumulative progress on razor-cadence #3128 item 4

| Batch | PR | Rules | Cross-refs |
|-------|----|---|------------|
| 1 | #3152 | 4 | 30/30 LIVE |
| 2 | this PR | 4 | 37/37 LIVE |
| **Total** | — | **8** | **67/67 LIVE** |

~17% of 47 `.claude/rules/` files now have a clean composes-with audit. ~10 more per-tick batches would complete item 4.

## Convention observed

- `.claude/rules/<rule>.md` files reference memory via bare `memory/` prefix → **repo-scope** (889 feedback files in repo `memory/`). 13/13 LIVE confirms the convention.
- `docs/research/*.md` §33 archives reference memory with explicit user-scope qualifier (per [#3150's 1808Z fix](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3150)) → `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/` (396 files).

The split is now stable and load-bearing.

## Test plan

- [x] 17 rule cross-refs verified via `test -e .claude/rules/<file>`
- [x] 13 memory cross-refs verified via `test -e memory/<file>`
- [x] 7 backlog rows verified via `ls docs/backlog/P*/B-NNNN-*.md`
- [x] Shard committed at canonical path
- [x] Cron sentinel still armed

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/1822Z.md:53 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T18:27:43Z):

This progress statement is internally inconsistent: the same shard says only 8 rules have been audited, but this line says “~17/47 total `.claude/rules/` files” as if 17 files were audited. This should be “8/47 (~17%)” to match lines 41 and 62.

### Thread 2: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/1822Z.md:62 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T18:27:44Z):

Grammar nit: “per per-tick” repeats “per” and makes the sentence awkward. Use a single construction such as “per-tick audit batch” or “per tick audit batch.”
