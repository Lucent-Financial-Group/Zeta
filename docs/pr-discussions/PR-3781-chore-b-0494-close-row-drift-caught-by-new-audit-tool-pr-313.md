# PR #3781: chore(b-0494): close row — drift caught by new audit tool (PR #3134 shipped 2026-05-14)

First real-world use of `tools/hygiene/audit-backlog-status-drift.ts` (peer Otto-Desktop shipped via PR #3758/#3777). Audit flagged B-0494; manual per-acceptance verification confirmed pure-drift (all 6 acceptance criteria shipped via PR #3134).

## Pull request overview

Closes backlog row B-0494 as substrate drift after manual verification that all acceptance criteria were shipped via merged PR #3134. The row is marked `status: closed`, dated, and a Resolution section is appended; `docs/BACKLOG.md` is regenerated to reflect the closure.

**Changes:**
- Flip `B-0494` frontmatter to `status: closed`, bump `last_updated`, add `closed: 2026-05-16`
- Append Resolution section with per-acceptance verification table
- Update `docs/BACKLOG.md` index entry to checked
