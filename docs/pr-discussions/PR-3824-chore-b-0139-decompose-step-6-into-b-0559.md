## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/backlog/P1/B-0139-pre-substrate-kenji-era-otto-work-inventory-aaron-2026-05-01.md:81 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T08:16:11Z):

Line 81 appears to be a stray fragment ("aloging the targets.") accidentally appended after the existing final line which already ends with "pre-cataloging the targets." This is leftover text from a botched edit and should be removed.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-16T10:54:26Z):

Fixed in f5320cb — removed the stray `aloging the targets.` line. Thanks for catching the botched-edit artifact.

### Thread 2: docs/backlog/P1/B-0139-pre-substrate-kenji-era-otto-work-inventory-aaron-2026-05-01.md:11 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T08:16:11Z):

The `children` field was updated (B-0555, B-0559 added) but `last_updated` is still `2026-05-14`. Per tools/backlog/README.md, `last_updated` must be bumped on every content edit; please update it to 2026-05-16 to match the decomposition date.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-16T10:54:28Z):

Fixed in f5320cb — bumped `last_updated` to 2026-05-16.

### Thread 3: docs/backlog/P1/B-0139-pre-substrate-kenji-era-otto-work-inventory-aaron-2026-05-01.md:11 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-16T08:17:38Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Remove nonexistent child ID from decomposition list**

The parent row now lists `B-0555` as a child, but there is no backlog file with `id: B-0555` in `docs/backlog/**` (repo-wide search). This introduces a dangling decomposition edge, so consumers of the parent’s `children:` metadata cannot resolve that work item and the decomposition state becomes internally inconsistent (the row appears to have a child that cannot be tracked or completed). Either add the missing `B-0555` row in the same change or drop this ID from `children:`.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-16T10:54:30Z):

Cross-PR decomposition pattern: B-0555 is filed in sibling PR #3772 ("chore(b-0139): decompose step 1 into B-0555"), also in flight. The reference is dangling only at the file-tree time between the two PR landings — once #3772 merges, the parent `children:` resolves. This matches the "stale-but-fresh-looking findings" class in `.claude/rules/blocked-green-ci-investigate-threads.md`. Recommend merging #3772 first to clear the dangling state; no code change here.
