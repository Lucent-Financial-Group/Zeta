# PR #3875: shard(tick): 2026-05-16T12:53Z — 3rd contamination in 4 ticks; mid-tick rate-reset

## PR description

Final shard in the 12:21Z/12:36Z/12:53Z deferred-PR cluster. Push completed ~10 min after launch due to peer-Otto git contention on shared `.git/`. PR-create deferred to post-push.

## Shard

[`docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/1253Z.md`](docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/1253Z.md) — 3rd multi-Otto contamination observation. HEAD at tick start: `otto-cli-audit-subclass-catalog-2026-05-16-1156z` (3rd distinct peer branch this session).

## Pattern stable across 4 ticks

| Tick | HEAD at tick start |
|---|---|
| 12:11Z | `otto-cli-b0206-audit-2026-05-16-1207z` (own) |
| 12:21Z | `otto-cli-b0037.2-audit-2026-05-16-1131z` (peer) |
| 12:36Z | `otto-cli-b0206-audit-2026-05-16-1207z` (bounced back) |
| 12:53Z | `otto-cli-audit-subclass-catalog-2026-05-16-1156z` (new peer branch) |

Defense pattern (`git branch --show-current` + `git switch -c <fresh> origin/main`) 100% effective: 4/4 ticks caught contamination before any commit; 0 false-branch commits.

## Mid-tick rate-limit-reset operational

GraphQL went 0→4995 at 12:55Z mid-tick, allowing the deferred-PR backlog (3 branches) to land in coordinated burst — [#3872](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3872) + [#3873](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3873) + this PR. Empirical validation of the pure-git tier deferred-PR pattern.

## Pull request overview

Adds a new hygiene-history “tick” shard documenting a 2026-05-16T12:53Z cron fire, capturing the third observed multi-Otto branch contamination within four ticks and the operational plan around an imminent GraphQL rate-limit reset.

**Changes:**
- Added a new tick record at 12:53Z with refresh-state snapshot (rate limits, processes, HEAD, deferred PR backlog).
- Documented a 4-tick contamination cadence table and the “defense pattern” effectiveness.
- Recorded the planned mid-tick transition from pure-git tier to normal tier post reset.
