# PR #3184: shard(tick): 1851Z — PR #3179 arithmetic fix + #3181 mise rerun

## PR description

## Summary

Tick 1851Z recovers two in-flight Otto PRs:

### PR #3179 (1841Z razor-cadence batch 4 shard)

Codex left 2 new P2 threads — both real findings:

1. **Arithmetic mismatch**: shard said "29/29 cross-references LIVE" but the deduplicated category breakdown sums to 28 (\`6 + 12 + 7 + 3\`). Root cause: \`B-0421\` was double-counted as both a "backlog-row file" reference (in peer-call-infrastructure.md cross-refs) AND one of the "3 backlog rows" (B-0326, B-0327, B-0421). Corrected to 28/28; cumulative razor-cadence tally adjusted 113/114 → 112/113.

2. **Placeholder vs real glob**: step 4 said "\`ls docs/backlog/P*/B-NNNN-*.md\`" — Codex correctly noted \`B-NNNN\` is placeholder shorthand, not a working glob. Updated to show explicit per-row commands (\`ls docs/backlog/P*/B-0326-*.md\`, etc.) + labeled \`B-NNNN\` as placeholder.

Fixes at commit \`24449f6\` on the #3179 branch; both threads resolved via GraphQL.

### PR #3181 (1846Z razor-cadence batch 5 shard)

Still hit by mise rate-limit lint failures from prior tick. Reran failed jobs via \`gh run rerun --failed\` on workflows 25879019441 + 25879019454. Gate BLOCKED → wait-ci with autoMerge armed.

## Mechanization candidate

\`tools/hygiene/audit-shard-arithmetic.ts\`: parse category breakdowns from tick shards + verify totals sum. Composes with B-0506 worktree-prune cadence. Not filed this tick (per-tick value < new-tool-PR cost).

## Test plan

- [x] PR #3179 commit \`24449f6\` lands the 2-line arithmetic + glob fix
- [x] Both Codex threads on #3179 resolved
- [x] PR #3179 gate transitioned BLOCKED → wait-ci
- [x] PR #3181 reruns kicked off; gate BLOCKED → wait-ci

Tick shard documenting recovery actions on two in-flight PRs: arithmetic/glob fixes applied to PR #3179 after Codex review, and CI reruns for PR #3181 to clear mise rate-limit failures.

**Changes:**
- Adds a single new tick-history file under `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/` documenting the 1851Z tick.
