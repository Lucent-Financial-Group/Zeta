# PR #3189: shard(tick): 1903Z — razor-cadence batch 6 (4 foundational rules, 20/20 LIVE)

## PR description

Batch 6 razor-cadence audit. 4 foundational rules; 20/20 cross-refs LIVE.

Cumulative: **24/50 rules audited (48% — halfway)**; **154/155 LIVE (99.4%)**.

Notable health signal: `zeta-expected-branch.md` references rule→hook→core→test chain (4 files), all LIVE. The mechanization is intact and consistent with its rule documentation.
