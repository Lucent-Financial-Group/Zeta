# PR #2752: fix(dashboard): B-0417 rename Zeta Factory to Zeta Plant

### Thread 1: demo/index.html:6 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-11T20:54:57Z):

P1: Terminology rename looks incomplete vs PR description. This page still shows user-visible text containing “factory” (e.g., “Syncing factory operations...” around line 606 and the rate-limit hint “The factory will automatically retry.” around line 963). Please update the remaining user-facing strings (and optionally the nearby HTML comment “TAB 1: FACTORY”) so the dashboard consistently uses “Plant”.

### Thread 2: demo/index.html:600 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-11T21:02:47Z):

P1: The UI copy has been renamed to “Plant”, but the tab wiring still uses the old “factory” identifier (`switchTab('factory', ...)` / `id="tab-factory"`). This mismatch makes the rename incomplete and is easy to trip over in future edits. Consider renaming the tab id and switchTab argument to `plant` (and updating any related references), or keep the comment/header terminology aligned with the internal id if you intentionally want to preserve the old identifier.
