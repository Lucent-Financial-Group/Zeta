# PR #5025: backlog(081KSE6WT0008QG0R003BCQEKW): add Noether decomposition land via PR tracking ticket

## PR description

## Summary

Adds backlog row **081KSE6WT0008QG0R003BCQEKW** under P3 to track the landing of Lior's Noether decomposition child files (`081KQ0YZ80008QG0R002T6TM7Z.1` through `081KQ0YZ80008QG0R002T6TM7Z.4`) on `main` via PR #4926 (or sibling PR). 

This establishes a substrate-honest, observable path for tracking in-flight remote work following the 081KSE6WT0008QG0R003YYC9PV and B-0751 local main checkout alignment.

## Pull request overview

Adds a new P3 backlog tracking row (**081KSE6WT0008QG0R003BCQEKW**) to make the “Noether decomposition” work observable and track its landing onto `origin/main` via PR #4926 (or a sibling PR), following the earlier local-main alignment work.

**Changes:**
- Added a new backlog row file `081KSE6WT0008QG0R003BCQEKW` under `docs/backlog/P3/`.
- Documented origin context, current state of the remote branch/PR, and concrete acceptance criteria for landing the decomposed child rows.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/backlog/P3/081KSE6WT0008QG0R003BCQEKW-noether-decomposition-land-via-pr-2026-05-25.md:17 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-25T23:02:46Z):

[P1] `composes_with` is populated with file paths to child backlog rows that do not exist in-tree yet (081KQ0YZ80008QG0R002T6TM7Z.1–081KQ0YZ80008QG0R002T6TM7Z.4). This creates immediate dead cross-references and also diverges from the documented backlog schema that expects backlog IDs (tools/backlog/README.md:71-73). Suggest keeping `composes_with` to existing rows (e.g., just 081KQ0YZ80008QG0R002T6TM7Z) and leaving the not-yet-landed children in the body/acceptance criteria until they exist.

### @AceHack (2026-05-26T02:25:05Z)

Addressed Copilot P1 finding in commit b51428207: `composes_with` now uses bare `B-NNNN` IDs per [backlog schema](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/blob/main/tools/backlog/README.md#L73), and the not-yet-existing children (081KQ0YZ80008QG0R002T6TM7Z.1–081KQ0YZ80008QG0R002T6TM7Z.4) are dropped — they remain documented in the body's Acceptance criteria #2 (their existence on main IS the row's acceptance bar).
