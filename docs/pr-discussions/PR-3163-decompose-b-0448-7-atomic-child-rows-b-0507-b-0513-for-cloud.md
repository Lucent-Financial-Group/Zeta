# PR #3163: decompose(B-0448): 7 atomic child rows B-0507..B-0513 for Cloud Routines integration

## PR description

## Summary

- Decomposes B-0448 (Cloud Routines integration — 4th catch-43 defence layer) into 7 dependency-ordered atomic child backlog rows (B-0507..B-0513)
- Updates B-0448 parent row to `status: decomposed` with `child_rows` frontmatter field
- No code changes — documentation-only decomposition PR

## Dependency graph

```
B-0507 (research, unblocked)
  └── B-0508 (schema)
        ├── B-0509 (installer)
        └── B-0510 (cloud-schedule.json)
              └── B-0511 (register + empirical fire)
                    ├── B-0512 (README 4-layer table)
                    └── B-0513 (memory file)
```

## Child rows

| Slice | Row | Title |
|-------|-----|-------|
| 1 | B-0507 | Research Cloud Routines auth + registration API surface (gate row) |
| 2 | B-0508 | Define `cloud-schedule.json` schema for `tools/routines/<id>/` |
| 3 | B-0509 | Extend `tools/routines/install.ts` to detect + surface `cloud-schedule.json` |
| 4 | B-0510 | Author `autonomous-loop/cloud-schedule.json` (first Cloud Routine declaration) |
| 5 | B-0511 | Register Cloud Routine + empirical first-fire observation |
| 6 | B-0512 | Update `tools/routines/README.md` with 4-layer catch-43 table |
| 7 | B-0513 | Memory file capturing empirical Cloud Routine bootstrap learning |

## Focused checks

- [x] ID collision check: B-0507..B-0513 verified clear on-disk (highest on-disk was B-0505) and in-flight (B-0506 open PR is the only in-flight row in this range)
- [x] Bus claim acquired: `otto-cli` claimed B-0448 before write work began
- [x] Format matches existing decomposed child rows (e.g. B-0471..B-0474)
- [x] Decomposition hint from B-0448 itself used as starting point, then refined
- [x] Each child row has `parent: B-0448`, correct `depends_on:`, pre-start checklist, acceptance criteria, and definition of done

## Next step

Pick up B-0507 (unblocked). After B-0507 closes, B-0508, B-0509, and B-0510 can proceed in parallel.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/backlog/P1/B-0510-b0448-slice4-autonomous-loop-cloud-schedule-json-2026-05-14.md:45 (unresolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-14T18:30:50Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Keep cloud schedule trigger shape consistent**

This template uses a `triggers` array, but slice 2 defines the canonical schema with a singular `trigger` object (`docs/backlog/P1/B-0508-b0448-slice2-cloud-schedule-json-schema-2026-05-14.md`, schema examples). If B-0508 lands as written, implementers following this row will produce `cloud-schedule.json` files that fail schema/type validation and installer expectations, blocking B-0510/B-0511 until one side is rewritten; align both slices to one field shape.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

### Thread 2: docs/backlog/P1/B-0511-b0448-slice5-register-cloud-routine-empirical-fire-2026-05-14.md:107 (unresolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-14T18:30:50Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Avoid unsupported `blocked` status in fallback flow**

The fallback instructs closing the row as `status: blocked`, but backlog pickup only treats `status === "open"` as actionable (`tools/backlog/autonomous-pickup.ts`), so a blocked row drops out of automatic selection and can be stranded indefinitely unless someone remembers to manually reopen it. In the exact “Cloud Routines unavailable” scenario this creates workflow deadlock risk; use a supported status/lifecycle or add explicit tooling support for `blocked`.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

### Thread 3: docs/backlog/P1/B-0448-cloud-routines-integration-4th-catch-43-defence-layer-2026-05-13.md:12 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T18:32:20Z):

P1: This new parent field uses `child_rows`, but decomposed backlog parents consistently use `children:` (for example B-0426 and many other parents). Keeping a unique field name makes the child list invisible to existing grep/tooling conventions and contradicts the line below that tells readers to use the `child_rows` field for PR tracking.

### Thread 4: docs/backlog/P1/B-0507-b0448-slice1-cloud-routines-api-research-2026-05-14.md:2 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T18:32:21Z):

P1: These new backlog rows are not reflected in `docs/BACKLOG.md`; searching the generated index shows no B-0507 entry. `tools/backlog/README.md` says the generator regenerates `docs/BACKLOG.md`, so the index will be stale and readers/tools using it will miss the new decomposition.

### Thread 5: docs/backlog/P1/B-0510-b0448-slice4-autonomous-loop-cloud-schedule-json-2026-05-14.md:57 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T18:32:21Z):

P1: This template uses a plural `triggers` array, but the schema slice (B-0508) and installer contract (B-0509) both define a singular `trigger`/`CloudTrigger`. As written, the first `cloud-schedule.json` produced by this row would not validate against the schema it depends on.

### Thread 6: docs/backlog/P1/B-0511-b0448-slice5-register-cloud-routine-empirical-fire-2026-05-14.md:107 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T18:32:22Z):

P1: `blocked` is not an allowed backlog status; the current schema allows `open`, `closed`, `superseded-by-B-NNNN`, `deferred`, and `decomposed`. Following this instruction would create a row status that the backlog tooling/documentation does not define, so use an allowed blocked-state representation instead.

### Thread 7: docs/backlog/P1/B-0513-b0448-slice7-memory-file-empirical-bootstrap-learning-2026-05-14.md:38 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T18:32:22Z):

P1: The proposed memory filename uses a hyphenated date placeholder, but the memory format standard requires snake_case filenames and date suffixes in `_YYYY_MM_DD` form. If this template is followed literally, the new memory file will violate the memory filename rules.

### Thread 8: docs/backlog/P1/B-0513-b0448-slice7-memory-file-empirical-bootstrap-learning-2026-05-14.md:48 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T18:32:22Z):

P1: This frontmatter template is not valid for `memory/` files: `type` must be a top-level field, no extra `metadata:` field is allowed, and the value must match the filename prefix. The proposed path starts with `feedback_` but this template marks it as `project`, so the implementing slice would create a memory file that fails the documented memory schema.

### Thread 9: docs/backlog/P1/B-0513-b0448-slice7-memory-file-empirical-bootstrap-learning-2026-05-14.md:95 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T18:32:22Z):

P2: The proposed `MEMORY.md` index entry is longer than the memory index standard's under-150-character limit. Following this template would add an over-budget index line; shorten the label/filename reference or move detail into the memory body.

### Thread 10: docs/backlog/P1/B-0510-b0448-slice4-autonomous-loop-cloud-schedule-json-2026-05-14.md:60 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T18:32:23Z):

P2: This template would put a persona name into a current-state configuration file under `tools/routines/`. The repo convention keeps names on history surfaces like backlog rows, but reusable code/config should use role references instead, so the future `cloud-schedule.json` should avoid carrying this attribution into the routine description.

### Thread 11: docs/backlog/P1/B-0512-b0448-slice6-readme-4-layer-table-2026-05-14.md:27 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T18:32:23Z):

P2: This says the replacement is a "4-column table", but the template below is a 7-column table and appears to be a 4-layer table. The mismatch makes the work item ambiguous for the implementer.

### Thread 12: docs/backlog/P1/B-0512-b0448-slice6-readme-4-layer-table-2026-05-14.md:75 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T18:32:23Z):

P1: The section is supposed to explain why there are 4 layers, but it lists only layers 1, 2, and 4. Since the template table gives layer 3 its own drift/cross-machine failure mode, omitting it here would leave the README's rationale internally inconsistent.
