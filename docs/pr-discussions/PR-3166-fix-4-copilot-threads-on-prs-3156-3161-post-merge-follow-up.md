# PR #3166: fix: 4 Copilot threads on PRs #3156 + #3161 (post-merge follow-up)

## PR description

### Summary

Both #3156 (B-0506 row) and #3161 (1822Z shard) auto-merged before Copilot's review threads could be addressed — autoMerge is armed once CI passes, and Copilot's findings were advisory (not \`required_conversation_resolution\`). Fixing the 4 findings on main as a small follow-up.

### Findings + fixes

**PR #3156 (B-0506 \`docs/backlog/P3/B-0506-stale-worktree-prune-cadence-mechanization-2026-05-14.md\`)**:

1. Frontmatter \`type: feature\` vs body "P3 friction-reducer" — changed \`type: feature\` → \`type: chore\` (matches the \`chore(backlog)\` commit prefix; resolves semantic mismatch)
2. \`Composes with\` listed bare filenames (\`claim-acquire-before-worktree-work.md\`, \`encoding-rules-without-mechanizing.md\`) — added full \`.claude/rules/\` paths for unambiguous nav

**PR #3161 (\`docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/1822Z.md\`)**:

3. "~17/47" → "8/47 (~17%)" — internal-consistency fix (8 rules audited, not 17; aligns with lines 41 + 62)
4. "per per-tick" → "per-tick" — grammar nit

### Why this PR

The auto-merge happened ~3 minutes after the prior PRs' CI passed, before I could see Copilot's threads. Substrate-honest follow-up is to fix on main rather than leave the findings unaddressed.

The 4 threads on the merged PRs will be resolved via GraphQL \`resolveReviewThread\` after this lands.

### Test plan

- [x] B-0506 frontmatter aligns with commit prefix
- [x] B-0506 Composes-with paths are full + navigable
- [x] 1822Z shard count is internally consistent
- [x] Grammar nit fixed
