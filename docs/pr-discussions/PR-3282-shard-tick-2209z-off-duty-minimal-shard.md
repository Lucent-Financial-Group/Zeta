**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Replace non-resolvable commit reference with durable provenance**

This shard cites commit `0a9a2e2` as the authorization source, but that object is not reachable from the current repository history, so future readers cannot reconstruct or verify the off-duty decision from canonical substrate alone. In this project’s tick-history workflow, provenance needs to remain reproducible after branch cleanup/squash, so this should point to a durable artifact (for example a merged commit on `main`, a stable PR URL, or the canonical shard file path) instead of an ephemeral commit hash.
