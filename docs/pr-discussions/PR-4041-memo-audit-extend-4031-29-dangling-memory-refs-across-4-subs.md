# PR #4041: memo(audit): extend #4031 — 29 dangling memory refs across 4 substrate surfaces (systemic, not rule-local)

## PR description

## Summary

Extension of audit [#4031](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4031) (which found 5 dangling rule→memory refs in `.claude/rules/`). Extending the scan to 4 other substrate surfaces revealed **29 dangling refs total** — 6× scaling, systemic across the substrate, not rule-local.

| Surface | Dangling / Unique |
|---------|-------------------|
| `.claude/agents/` | 0 / 0 |
| `.claude/skills/` | 1 / 14 |
| `docs/research/` | 8 / 186 |
| `docs/backlog/` | 17 / 200 |
| `memory/persona/` | 3 / 58 |
| **TOTAL** | **29 dangling** |

(The `.claude/rules/` original 5 are already addressed by #4031 + #4033 + #4038 chain.)

## Audit-method gap also documented

Original `sort -u` audit-form hides multi-citation edges (the bug that caused #4036 r1 to miss the m-acc rule's citation site that #4038 r2 had to back-fill). Better audit tracks file:line pairs, not deduplicated filenames.

## Not P0; filed as substrate-engineer candidate

`tools/hygiene/audit-dangling-memory-refs.ts` + CI integration would mechanize the discipline at substrate-level rather than discipline-level.

## Test plan

- [x] `git diff origin/main..HEAD --name-only` returns only the new memo file
- [x] Tree canary clean (53 entries)
- [ ] CI green on docs-only PR

## Pull request overview

Documentation-only memo under `memory/` that extends the audit from PR #4031 to additional substrate surfaces, reporting 29 dangling memory-file references across 4 surfaces.

**Changes:**
- Adds a new project-type memory file documenting the systemic dangling-ref pattern.
- Records the extended audit command and the `sort -u` methodology gap.
