# PR #4312: fix(hygiene): clear 2026-05-18 tick-link drift

## PR description

## What changed

- Fixes 15 repo-relative links in 2026-05-18 tick shards by correcting path depth from five `..` segments to six where needed.
- Converts one user-scope memory path that points outside repo-canonical history from a markdown link into plain code text.
- Releases the claim `task-fix-20260518-tick-shard-links` in the same branch history.

## Why

Adjacent archive/research PRs (#4306, #4308, #4309 and siblings) were all failing `lint (tick-shard relative-paths)` on the same shared 2026-05-18 hygiene-history debt, not on their branch payloads.

## Verification

- `bun tools/hygiene/audit-tick-shard-relative-paths.ts --enforce --baseline tools/hygiene/audit-tick-shard-relative-paths.baseline.json`
- `git diff --check`

## Pull request overview

This PR fixes broken repo-relative links in 2026-05-18 hygiene tick shards by correcting path depth to reach the repository root and avoiding a non-repo-canonical user-scope memory link.

**Changes:**
- Updates `.claude/rules` and `docs/backlog` relative links from five to six `..` segments where needed.
- Converts one out-of-repo user-scope memory reference from a markdown link to plain code text.
- Keeps the hygiene-history archival content intact while making link-audit enforcement pass for these touched shards.
