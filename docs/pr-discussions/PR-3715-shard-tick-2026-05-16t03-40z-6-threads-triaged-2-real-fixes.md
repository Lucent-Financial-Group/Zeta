# PR #3715: shard(tick): 2026-05-16T03:40Z — 6 threads triaged (2 real fixes + 4 stale/FP)

## PR description

Tick 16: PR #3707 + #3708 merged. 6 new Copilot threads investigated across #3709 + #3710. 2 real fixes (role-refs + §33 PR-attribution factual error). 4 stale/false-positive (including 4th-time Copilot table-pipe || hallucination).

Copilot pattern: verify-first, resolve-no-op on the table-pipe class.

## Pull request overview

Adds a new tick-history shard documenting tick 16 of the autonomous-loop session: triage of 6 Copilot review threads across PRs #3709 and #3710, with 2 real fixes applied and 4 stale/false-positive threads resolved no-op.

**Changes:**
- New tick-shard file recording PR #3707/#3708 merges and #3709/#3710 thread triage outcomes.
- Documents a 4th-occurrence Copilot false-positive pattern ("double leading pipe" hallucination) and recommends verify-first discipline.
- Lists next-tick candidates including a suspect-Copilot-finding rule extension.
