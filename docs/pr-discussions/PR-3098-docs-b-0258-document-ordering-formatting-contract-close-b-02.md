# PR #3098: docs(b-0258): document ordering/formatting contract; close B-0258

## PR description

## Summary

- Closes B-0258 (MEMORY.md index generator implementation, P1)
- The generator itself was already shipped under B-0423 (`tools/memory/reindex-memory-md.ts`, PR #3004, merged 2026-05-13)
- The last open AC was *"Ordering and formatting are documented"*

## Changes

**`tools/memory/reindex-memory-md.ts`** — add three block-comment sections to the file header:

- `## Ordering` — sort key is `created` frontmatter field (ISO date, descending); filename-date fallback; `0000-00-00` bottom-bucket; ties broken by readdir order
- `## Formatting` — entry format: `- [**<name>**](<filename>) — <description>`; 240-char truncation; 100-entry cap with overflow note
- `## Stability` — same-day idempotence guarantee; `--check` exit codes (0 = current, 2 = stale)

**`docs/backlog/P1/B-0258-*.md`** — `status: open → closed`; add pre-start checklist documenting prior-art search (found B-0423 implementation) and dependency confirmation (B-0257 merged PR #3097)

## Test plan

- [x] `bun test tools/memory/reindex-memory-md.test.ts` — 18/18 pass
- [x] `dotnet build -c Release` — 0 warnings, 0 errors
- [x] `bun tools/memory/reindex-memory-md.ts --check` — exits 2 (STALE, 1202 entries); confirms the generator correctly detects drift
- [ ] No hook or CI wiring added (per B-0258 AC)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-14T05:09:02Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Fix tie-break ordering claim in reindexer contract docs**

The new ordering contract says same-date ties are broken by lexicographic filename order, but `collectEntries` only sorts by `date` (`entries.sort((a, b) => b.date.localeCompare(a.date))`) and does not apply a filename comparator. In practice this leaves tie order dependent on `readdir` input order, so the documented guarantee is stronger than the implementation and can mislead anyone relying on reproducible ordering across environments.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-14T05:18:21Z):

Fixed in commits 38a670b (Aaron, same session) and cbb03e29 (this commit). The sort now uses a chained comparator: `b.date.localeCompare(a.date) || a.filename.localeCompare(b.filename)`, so same-date ties are broken by ascending lexicographic filename — matching the documented contract exactly. Comment + implementation are now consistent.
