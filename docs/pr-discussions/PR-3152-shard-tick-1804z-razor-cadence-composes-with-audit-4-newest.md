# PR #3152: shard(tick): 1804Z — razor-cadence composes-with audit (4 newest rules, 30/30 LIVE)

## PR description

## Summary

Tick shard for 2026-05-14T18:04Z.

Razor-cadence issue #3128 item 4 (composes-with audit) executed on the 4 most-recently-added `.claude/rules/` files:

| Rule (PR) | File refs | Backlog rows |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| `autonomous-loop-per-tick-pointer.md` (#3042) | 9 | B-0448 |
| `otto-channels-reference-card.md` (#3041) | 7 | B-0400, B-0444 |
| `holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure.md` (#3029) | 5 | B-0440, B-0441 |
| `claim-acquire-before-worktree-work.md` (#3032) | 9 | B-0400, B-0440, B-0444, B-0445 |

**Result**: 24 file references LIVE + 6 backlog rows LIVE = **30/30 cross-references survive the audit**. No stale pointers.

## Why this work

PR #3150 (Manifesto V2 §33 archive) is in real-dependency-wait (4 required checks in-progress, auto-merge armed by Aaron). Per `never-be-idle`: pick parallel speculative work. Razor-cadence issue #3128 has been open since 11:21Z asking for a 5-item audit pass; item 4 is the lowest-effort highest-clarity checklist item (mechanical existence checks; clean binary result).

## Substrate notes

Per-tick razor-pass shape established: item 4 = pick 3-5 newest rules → audit cross-references → shard the result. Repeatable on future ticks. Items 1 (operational form), 2 (dialectical-unfalsifiability), 3 (mechanization audit), 5 (MEMORY.md index audit) need deeper read of rule contents themselves and are deferred to follow-up ticks.

## Test plan

- [x] All referenced files exist (24/24 LIVE)
- [x] All referenced backlog rows exist (6/6 LIVE)
- [x] Shard committed at `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/1804Z.md`
- [x] Cron sentinel armed (`<<autonomous-loop>>`, every minute)

## Pull request overview

Adds a single tick shard documenting the 18:04Z hygiene tick that performed the composes-with audit (item 4 of razor-cadence #3128) over the four most recently added `.claude/rules/` files, recording 30/30 cross-references LIVE.

**Changes:**
- New tick shard at `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/1804Z.md` capturing the per-tick 7-step autonomous-loop discipline output.
