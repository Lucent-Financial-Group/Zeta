# PR #3026: feat(scaffold): B-0424.6 — add .semgrep.yml GHA injection rule to forge+ace scaffold templates

## PR description

## Summary

- **Slice**: B-0424.6 — ADR 2026-04-22 checklist item: *"Semgrep rule for GHA inline-untrusted-in-run injection (already landed on Zeta; generalise to Forge + ace)"*
- Adds `tools/scaffold/forge/.semgrep.yml` and `tools/scaffold/ace/.semgrep.yml`, each containing the `gha-untrusted-in-run-line` rule (Rule 17 from Zeta's `.semgrep.yml`)
- Updates `create-repo.ts` step07 manual steps: step 3 is now "wire gate workflow" since the config file is now scaffolded (only CI job wiring deferred to Stage 2)
- Updates `tools/scaffold/README.md` template tree listing and manual-steps note
- Extends existing step-06 tests to assert `.semgrep.yml` present for both forge and ace

## Test plan

- [x] `bun test tools/scaffold/create-repo.test.ts` — **18 pass, 0 fail**
- [x] `semgrep --config tools/scaffold/forge/.semgrep.yml --validate` — 0 errors, 1 rule
- [x] `semgrep --config tools/scaffold/ace/.semgrep.yml --validate` — 0 errors, 1 rule
- [x] `dotnet build -c Release` — 0 warnings, 0 errors

## Context

B-0424 Stage 1 is the three-repo split scaffold (`LFG/Forge` + `LFG/ace`). Previous slices:
- B-0424.1: pre-start gate + scope decision (scaffold deferred actual creation)
- B-0424.2: `scaffold-stage1-create-repos.yml` CI dispatch workflow
- B-0424.3–B-0424.4: governance templates + `create-repo.ts` tool
- B-0424.5 (PR #3025): dry-run test suite (18 tests)

This slice completes one remaining ADR checklist item for the template set. The `.semgrep.yml` files are pushed as day-one governance files by `create-repo.ts` step 06 (before branch protection). CI wiring of the `semgrep` lint job remains a Stage-2 task.

## Pull request overview

Adds Semgrep governance to the Stage-1 scaffold templates for the Forge and ace repos, ensuring the GitHub Actions inline-untrusted-in-`run:` injection rule is present from day one and reflected in the scaffold tool/docs.

**Changes:**
- Add `.semgrep.yml` to both `tools/scaffold/forge/` and `tools/scaffold/ace/` containing `gha-untrusted-in-run-line`.
- Update scaffold docs + `create-repo.ts` step-07 manual steps to reflect that only CI wiring remains manual (Stage 2).
- Extend the existing dry-run tests to assert `.semgrep.yml` is included in the scaffolded file set.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: tools/scaffold/forge/.semgrep.yml:10 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-13T20:27:13Z):

The header comment claims Semgrep is pinned via `pipx:semgrep` in `.mise.toml`, but the scaffolded Forge repo template currently does not include a `.mise.toml` (or an install script) in this directory. This is likely to confuse consumers of the template. Either scaffold the corresponding toolchain pin file as well, or reword to point at the current source of truth (e.g., Zeta’s toolchain) and/or note that the pin lands in Stage 2. Also consider calling out that `pipx:` is mise’s registry name and installs via `uv` when present (per ADR 2026-04-27) to avoid implying pipx is required.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-13T20:31:15Z):

Fixed in the latest commit (dbcad11d): added `tools/scaffold/forge/.mise.toml` with `uv = "0.11.8"` and `"pipx:semgrep" = "1.161.0"` so the pin claim in the header is accurate. Also updated the header comment to clarify that `pipx:` is mise's registry prefix routing through `uv tool install` (per ADR 2026-04-27). Dry-run test extended to assert `.mise.toml` is present in the step-06 file set.
