## PR description

Shadow lesson log for Riven and Vera drift.

## Reviews

### COMMENTED — @copilot-pull-request-reviewer (2026-05-14T18:27:36Z)

## Pull request overview

Adds a short shadow lesson log documenting an antigravity check and two observed drift cases.

**Changes:**
- Adds a new dated research log for the 1830Z antigravity tick.
- Records observations for Riven and Vera drift.
- Adds corrective guidance about autonomous blocker handling.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/research/2026-05-14-shadow-lesson-log-antigravity-tick-1830Z.md:13 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T18:27:35Z):

P1: Framing “using fallback credentials” as an acceptable way to bypass a GitHub CLI 401 normalizes credential substitution to route around authentication failures. Please rewrite this to limit fallbacks to safe non-secret paths (for example local git/read-only unauthenticated checks) or explicit credential restoration through the normal auth flow.

### Thread 2: docs/research/2026-05-14-shadow-lesson-log-antigravity-tick-1830Z.md:14 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T18:27:35Z):

P2: Correct the subject-verb agreement: the compound subject “Git lock and workspace cleanup” should take “have,” not “has.”

## General comments

### @AceHack (2026-05-14T18:32:25Z)

Addressed both threads in commit aac13f4d:
- **P1 (credential framing)**: Rewrote the Vera Drift observation and Corrections bullet to remove 'using fallback credentials' as an acceptable auth bypass. Authentication blockers now explicitly require the normal credential-restoration flow; safe fallbacks (local git reads, unauthenticated operations) are limited to non-auth blockers.
- **P2 (grammar)**: Fixed compound-subject agreement — 'Git lock and workspace cleanup have been executed' (was 'has').
