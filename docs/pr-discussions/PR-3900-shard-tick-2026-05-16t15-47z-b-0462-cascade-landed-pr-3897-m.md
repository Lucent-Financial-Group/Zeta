# PR #3900: shard(tick): 2026-05-16T15:47Z — B-0462 cascade landed (PR #3897 MERGED); peer-contamination caught by branch-discipline

## PR description

## Summary

Cascade chain from 1531Z commit → 1535Z PR-open → 1547Z merged confirmation. [PR #3897](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3897) (B-0462 7th cycle close-row) landed at `4443c09`. [PR #3898](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3898) (1535Z tick shard) still auto-merging cleanly.

**Peer-contamination caught:** `git branch --show-current` at tick start reported peer Otto-CLI's branch (`otto-cli-b0457-close-2026-05-16-1542z`), not mine. The branch-discipline (not the env-var hook) made the silent HEAD-shift visible BEFORE any mutating operation. Recovered via `git switch -c` (no worktree-add pack-contention).

Rate-limit: 565 → ~555 GraphQL; 10min to reset. Extreme cost-aware tier continues; substantive observation IS the value-add for this tick (substrate-or-it-didn't-happen applies to confirmations too).

## Pull request overview

Adds a new hygiene-history tick shard documenting the 15:47Z cascade confirmation for B-0462 and capturing a branch-discipline catch of peer worktree contamination.

**Changes:**
- Adds tick shard `1547Z.md` with refresh state, cascade confirmation, and peer-contamination observation.
- Records operational notes on rate-limit posture and branch recovery steps.
- Adds cross-references (“Composes with”) to related rules/docs/backlog items.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/1547Z.md:38 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T16:00:00Z):

The relative link to the B-0519 backlog row is off by one directory level from this tick shard’s location, so it won’t resolve correctly in GitHub’s renderer. From `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/`, you need to go up 5 levels to reach `docs/` before `backlog/P3/...` (see similar linking patterns in nearby tick shards like `0415Z.md`).

### Thread 2: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/1547Z.md:51 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T16:00:00Z):

The `.claude/rules/zeta-expected-branch.md` link is using a relative path that only goes up to `docs/`, which would imply a non-existent `docs/.claude/...`. From this file’s directory you need to go up to the repo root (6 levels) before `.claude/rules/...` (consistent with other tick shards in this folder).

### Thread 3: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/1547Z.md:89 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T16:00:01Z):

In the “Composes with” list, the relative link to `docs/AUTONOMOUS-LOOP-PER-TICK.md` appears to be one level too shallow (it currently resolves under `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/` rather than `docs/`). This should match the `../../../../../AUTONOMOUS-LOOP-PER-TICK.md` pattern used by other same-day tick shards (e.g., `0415Z.md`).

### Thread 4: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/1547Z.md:92 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T16:00:01Z):

The `refresh-world-model-poll-pr-gate.md` link in “Composes with” uses a relative path that resolves to `docs/.claude/...` (which doesn’t exist). It likely needs to go up to the repo root (6 levels) before `.claude/rules/...`, consistent with other tick shards’ `.claude` links.

### Thread 5: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/16/1547Z.md:96 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T16:00:01Z):

`Tick 1535Z shard` is linked as `1535Z.md`, but there is no `1535Z.md` file in this directory (nor elsewhere in the repo), so this is currently a dead link. If this is meant to reference PR #3898’s shard, link directly to the PR or update the filename once the 1535Z shard file exists on main.
