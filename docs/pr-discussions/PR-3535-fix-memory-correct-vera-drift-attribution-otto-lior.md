# PR #3535: fix(memory): correct Vera drift attribution Otto → Lior

## PR description

## Summary

Copilot caught a real attribution bug on the already-merged PR [#3516](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3516) (Vera §33 migration).

The archived lesson log at \`memory/persona/vera/conversations/2026-05-10-shadow-lesson-log-vera-narration.md\` says:

- **Author:** Lior (Antigravity check node)
- \"Lior detected the drift.\"

But \`memory/persona/vera/MEMORY.md\` said \"drift pattern caught by Otto\" — contradictory provenance preserved across the migration.

Fix: \"caught by Otto\" → \"caught by Lior on the antigravity-check node\". Single-character-equivalent change in 1 file; aligns the persona index with the archive content + clarifies Lior's antigravity-check responsibility.

## Test plan

- [x] Diff is 1 file, 1 logical change
- [x] Aligns with archive content (verified via \`git show\`)
- [ ] CI green
- [ ] Auto-merge arms

## Pull request overview

Corrects an attribution error in Vera's persona memory index — the drift was caught by Lior on the antigravity-check node, not by Otto. Aligns the persona index with the verbatim archive content.

**Changes:**
- Replace "caught by Otto" with "caught by Lior on the antigravity-check node" in `memory/persona/vera/MEMORY.md`.
