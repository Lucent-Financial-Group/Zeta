# PR #4082: shard(2026-05-17/1320Z): autonomous-loop tick — push peer 1317Z + open PR #4078

## PR description

## Shard substrate landing — post-merge new-arc opening tick

Single-file landing: `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/17/1320Z.md`.

Captures the new-arc-start tick after PR #4059 merged at 13:17:34Z. Substantive work this tick was substrate-preservation: pushed peer-Otto-CLI surface's local-only 1317Z shard (commit `e993c16`) to origin and opened [PR #4078](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/4078) for it with substrate-honest provenance disclosure.

Shard itself authored from an isolated worktree at `/private/tmp/zeta-1320z-shard-meta` per the race-window-caveat in `.claude/rules/zeta-expected-branch.md` (root worktree was on peer-Otto's shard branch with foreign working-tree mods).

Counter status: substantive-pick #1 of new (post-merge) arc.

## Pull request overview

Single-file tick shard documenting the autonomous-loop tick at 1320Z, capturing the post-merge new-arc start after PR #4059 merged and the substrate-preservation action of pushing peer-Otto's local-only 1317Z shard and opening PR #4078.

**Changes:**
- Adds tick shard under `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/17/` with YAML frontmatter and the standard 7-step autonomous-loop structure.
