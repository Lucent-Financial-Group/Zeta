# PR #3650: fix(pr-3646): 2 Copilot P1 threads — TOC + Round 45 overstatement caveats

## PR description

## Summary

Addresses 2 unresolved P1 Copilot threads on now-merged [PR #3646](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3646):

**Thread 1** — TOC + current-summary navigation stale. Moving Round 45 to the top in #3646 didn't update the surrounding scaffolding:
- Contents block (line 15) still started with Round 44 → added Round 45 entry above
- Descriptive note (line 44) still said "Round 44 (current) is in-flight" → reworded to preserve both labels: "Round 45 is the most recent landed round; Round 44 remains in-flight per its own label..."

**Thread 2** — Round 45 narrative overstates Step 1 result. The historical entry was written from PR #3614's original framing, before [PR #3636](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3636) + [PR #3639](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3639) established that:
1. Original M/A coherence laws aren't well-typed under stated signatures
2. Only provisional propositional Law 1' is type-correct
3. Laws 2/3 deferred to a new Step 1.5
4. `D ∘ Q ∘ I` is the incrementalization *identity*, not a monad (per [PR #3626](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3626))

Three sites in the Round 45 narrative reworded:
- Line 87 (coherence-satisfied overstatement) → "is intended to satisfy" + full caveat paragraph linking PRs #3636 + #3639
- Lines 89 + 91 (D∘Q∘I monad + monad-laws claims) → incrementalization-identity framing matching PR #3626 corrections elsewhere
- Line 131 (Arc 5 open question — "DBSP incrementalization monad") → "DBSP I/D pair... incrementalization *identity*, not a monad"

The Round 45 historical entry now matches the post-PR-3636 + post-PR-3639 substrate-honest state on main.

## Pull request overview

Updates `docs/ROUND-HISTORY.md` to resolve two follow-up documentation threads from prior merged work: (1) fix stale navigation scaffolding after moving Round 45 to the top, and (2) make the Round 45 narrative substrate-honest by aligning the Step 1 / coherence-laws discussion with the post-PR-3636 / PR-3639 corrections (and the PR-3626 clarification that `Q^Δ = D ∘ Q ∘ I` is an incrementalization identity, not a monad).

**Changes:**
- Adds a Round 45 entry to the Contents block and updates the “current round” note to reflect Round 45 landed while Round 44 remains in-flight.
- Rewords Round 45’s Step 1 section to downgrade the M/A coherence-laws claim to “intended to satisfy,” and adds an explicit caveat pointing to PR #3636 / #3639 outcomes.
- Reframes `D ∘ Q ∘ I` references to the incrementalization identity (not a monad) and updates the Arc 5 open question accordingly.

* P2: This list item runs together the question and the "Possible structural relations" follow-up on the same wrapped line, which makes the bullet hard to scan in rendered Markdown. Consider breaking after the question mark and moving the follow-up sentence to its own indented continuation line (and reflowing the line lengths).
```
- What is the precise relationship between the memory monad `M` (a monad on
  the topos `Zeta`) and the DBSP `I`/`D` pair (the integrate/differentiate
  operators participating in the incrementalization *identity* `Q^Δ = D ∘ Q ∘ I`,
  not a monad — per [PR #3626](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3626))? Possible structural relations: comonad-monad
  adjunction, distributive law, or no direct categorical correspondence.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/ROUND-HISTORY.md:99 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T00:50:26Z):

P2: The sentence starting on line 91 is a single very long line (two PR links + text), which is inconsistent with the surrounding hard-wrapped prose and makes future diffs harder to review. Please reflow/wrap this paragraph across multiple lines (keeping the same content) for readability and cleaner diffs.

This issue also appears on line 147 of the same file.
