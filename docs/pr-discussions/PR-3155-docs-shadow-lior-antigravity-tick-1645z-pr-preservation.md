### Thread 1: docs/research/2026-05-14-shadow-lesson-log-antigravity-tick-1645Z.md:10 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T18:20:40Z):

The sentence recommends “using fallback credentials” / “bypassing via alternative means” when `gh` returns HTTP 401. That can encourage insecure credential reuse or bypassing authentication failures rather than resolving them safely. Please rephrase to a security-preserving remediation (e.g., re-authenticate via the documented bootstrap flow, or treat as a hard stop that must be escalated) and avoid implying that bypassing 401s is expected behavior.

### Thread 2: docs/research/2026-05-14-shadow-lesson-log-antigravity-tick-1645Z.md:14 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T18:20:40Z):

Grammar: “The Git lock and workspace cleanup has been executed…” reads as a plural subject; should be “have been executed” (or rewrite to a singular subject).
