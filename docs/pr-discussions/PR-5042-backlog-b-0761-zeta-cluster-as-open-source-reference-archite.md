# PR #5042: backlog(081KSE6WT0008QG0R0015ZF2G6): Zeta cluster as open-source reference architecture for AI to train on and compete on (ARC-AGI-style)

## PR description

Aaron 2026-05-25 named the positioning today's cluster-install work has been building: a complete, open, modern, cloud-agnostic reference architecture AI systems can train on + benchmark against, like ARC-AGI for cluster infrastructure / DevOps. Composes with B-0754 / 081KSE6WT0008QG0R003612WGJ / 081KSE6WT0008QG0R001NG9JZH / 081KSE6WT0008QG0R000CV98PV / B-0758 / 081KSE6WT0008QG0R003G0Y62D / B-0760.

## Pull request overview

Adds a new P2 backlog row (081KSE6WT0008QG0R0015ZF2G6) capturing the positioning of the Zeta cluster-install substrate as an open-source, cloud-agnostic “reference architecture” that AI systems can train on and benchmark/compete against (ARC-AGI-style), and updates the generated backlog index to include the new row.

**Changes:**
- Added `docs/backlog/P2/081KSE6WT0008QG0R0015ZF2G6-...md` describing the problem/target, ARC-AGI benchmark parallels, and acceptance criteria.
- Updated `docs/BACKLOG.md` to include the new 081KSE6WT0008QG0R0015ZF2G6 entry under P2.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/backlog/P2/081KSE6WT0008QG0R0015ZF2G6-zeta-cluster-as-open-source-reference-architecture-for-ai-to-train-on-and-compete-on-arc-agi-style-benchmark-aaron-2026-05-25.md:100 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-26T00:06:37Z):

P1: The markdown table uses double leading pipes (`|| ... | ... |`), which will render as an extra empty column (or mis-render) on GitHub. Use standard table syntax with single leading/trailing pipes for each row.

### Thread 2: docs/backlog/P2/081KSE6WT0008QG0R0015ZF2G6-zeta-cluster-as-open-source-reference-architecture-for-ai-to-train-on-and-compete-on-arc-agi-style-benchmark-aaron-2026-05-25.md:147 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-26T00:06:37Z):

P1: This reference uses a placeholder path (`docs/research/2026-05-25-...`) that doesn't exist, so it will be a dead link and breaks cross-reference integrity. Replace with the actual research doc filename(s) or remove the bullet until the target exists.

### Thread 3: docs/backlog/P2/081KSE6WT0008QG0R0015ZF2G6-zeta-cluster-as-open-source-reference-architecture-for-ai-to-train-on-and-compete-on-arc-agi-style-benchmark-aaron-2026-05-25.md:149 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-26T00:06:38Z):

P1: This bullet references `project_zeta_cluster_install_target_persona_first_time_cli_users_3_node_production_ready_easier_than_proxmox_aaron_2026_05_25.md`, but that file doesn't exist anywhere in the repo and there’s no path given. Either add the file at a stable location (e.g., under `memory/` or `docs/research/`) and link it with a correct relative path, or remove the reference.

### Thread 4: docs/backlog/P2/081KSE6WT0008QG0R0015ZF2G6-zeta-cluster-as-open-source-reference-architecture-for-ai-to-train-on-and-compete-on-arc-agi-style-benchmark-aaron-2026-05-25.md:178 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-26T00:06:38Z):

P1: This text treats B-0749 as an existing backlog row, but there is no `id: B-0749` row file in `docs/backlog/**` (and it’s not in `docs/BACKLOG.md`). Either file B-0749 in this PR (or update the reference to the correct existing ID), or reword to avoid implying it already exists.

### Thread 5: docs/backlog/P2/081KSE6WT0008QG0R0015ZF2G6-zeta-cluster-as-open-source-reference-architecture-for-ai-to-train-on-and-compete-on-arc-agi-style-benchmark-aaron-2026-05-25.md:58 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-26T00:06:38Z):

P1: This references B-0743, but there is no `id: B-0743` backlog row file in the repo (and it’s not present in `docs/BACKLOG.md`). If this is meant to be a dependency/composition point, consider filing B-0743 (or updating to the correct existing ID) so the cross-reference graph stays navigable.
