# PR #3151: chore(b-0442): decompose into atomic child rows B-0503/B-0504/B-0505

## PR description

## Summary

B-0442 (missed-substrate cascade detector) has slices 1–4 + 6 already landed
(`tools/bg/missed-substrate-detector.ts` + 24 DST tests + launchd + docs).
The only remaining acceptance criterion is slice 5 — auto-opening recovery PRs.

This PR decomposes slice 5 into three dependency-ordered atomic child rows:

| Row | Effort | What | Depends on |
|-----|--------|------|-----------|
| **B-0503** | S | `openRecoveryPR` core function + `RecoveryAdapters` interface + all `RecoveryResult` arms tested in isolation | — |
| **B-0504** | S | Wire `--auto-recover`/`--recovery-dry-run` into `pollOnce`; real `spawnSync` adapter impls; `PollResult` extension | B-0503 |
| **B-0505** | XS | `docs/AUTONOMOUS-LOOP.md` + `tools/bg/README.md` updates; mark B-0442 slice 5 `[x]` | B-0504 |

### What changed

- `docs/backlog/P1/B-0503-b0442-slice5a-open-recovery-pr-core-function-2026-05-14.md` — new child row
- `docs/backlog/P1/B-0504-b0442-slice5b-wire-auto-recover-into-pollonce-2026-05-14.md` — new child row
- `docs/backlog/P1/B-0505-b0442-slice5c-docs-autonomous-loop-acceptance-close-2026-05-14.md` — new child row
- `docs/backlog/P1/B-0442-...md` — added `children: [B-0503, B-0504, B-0505]` frontmatter
- `docs/BACKLOG.md` — 3 new index rows under B-0442

### Focused checks

- `git diff --stat HEAD~1`: 5 files changed, 505 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
- `bun tools/bg/missed-substrate-detector.test.ts` — not modified; existing 24-test suite untouched
- No code changes in this PR — pure backlog substrate decomposition

### Decomposition rationale (per B-0442 design)

B-0503 separates the pure `openRecoveryPR` function (testable with injected adapters)
from the integration wiring in B-0504. This mirrors the slice 3 vs slice 4 split
already in B-0442: `realCascadeDetector` (pure, adapter-injected) was kept separate
from `REAL_ADAPTERS` + `pollOnce` wiring. B-0505 follows DV2.0 data-split discipline —
docs are satellites (fast-changing), code is hub (stable); separating them avoids
documentation tailing a code PR through review cycles.

## Pull request overview

Decomposes B-0442 slice 5 (“auto-opening recovery PRs”) into three dependency-ordered atomic backlog child rows (B-0503/B-0504/B-0505), and wires the decomposition into the B-0442 parent row plus the generated backlog index.

**Changes:**
- Added three new P1 backlog row files describing the slice 5a/5b/5c plan and acceptance criteria.
- Updated B-0442 frontmatter to record the new child rows and refreshed `last_updated`.
- Regenerated `docs/BACKLOG.md` to include the new rows in the P1 index.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/backlog/P1/B-0503-b0442-slice5a-open-recovery-pr-core-function-2026-05-14.md:146 (unresolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-14T18:08:44Z):

**<sub><sub>![P1 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P1-orange?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Fix idempotency check to avoid duplicate recovery PRs**

The workflow checks for an existing recovery PR using a branch name that is generated with `new Date()`, so each run usually queries a brand-new head branch and misses already-open recovery PRs for the same source PR. In repeated detector runs, this can open duplicate recovery PRs instead of being idempotent. The existence check needs to key off stable identity (e.g., original PR number/marker) rather than the timestamped branch name.

### Thread 2: docs/backlog/P1/B-0503-b0442-slice5a-open-recovery-pr-core-function-2026-05-14.md:165 (unresolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-14T18:08:44Z):

**<sub><sub>![P1 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P1-orange?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Abort cherry-pick state before continuing poll loop**

On a cherry-pick conflict this flow returns immediately without any cleanup, but the planned real adapter runs raw `git cherry-pick`; that leaves `CHERRY_PICK_HEAD`/conflicted index and the recovery branch checked out. Since the design also says polling should continue after recovery failures, the service can get stuck failing subsequent git operations until manual intervention. The conflict/error path should include explicit rollback/abort steps before returning.

### Thread 3: docs/backlog/P1/B-0503-b0442-slice5a-open-recovery-pr-core-function-2026-05-14.md:34 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T18:10:37Z):

P1: This row says it does not add `--auto-recover` / `--dry-run` CLI flags, but the planned flag name elsewhere (including B-0504/B-0505) is `--recovery-dry-run`. Update this bullet to use the correct flag name to avoid implementing/documenting a mismatched CLI surface.

### Thread 4: docs/backlog/P1/B-0505-b0442-slice5c-docs-autonomous-loop-acceptance-close-2026-05-14.md:49 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T18:10:38Z):

P1: The acceptance-criteria snippet hard-codes "landed 2026-05-14". Since the actual landing date for slice 5 may differ, this risks baking an incorrect historical record into B-0442. Consider using a placeholder (or omitting the date) and filling it in when the slice actually lands.

### Thread 5: docs/backlog/P1/B-0505-b0442-slice5c-docs-autonomous-loop-acceptance-close-2026-05-14.md:52 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T18:10:38Z):

The acceptance criteria includes updating B-0442 frontmatter to add `children: [B-0503, B-0504, B-0505]`, but this PR already makes that change in the B-0442 row. To avoid a future "already done" checkbox, either drop this criterion from B-0505 or mark it as satisfied with a note that it was completed in the decomposition PR.
