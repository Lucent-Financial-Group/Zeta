# PR #3646: fix(round-history): move Round 45 above Round 44 — Copilot P1 from PR #3614

## PR description

## Summary

Addresses the last unresolved P1 finding from [PR #3614](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3614) review (Copilot):

> Round 45 entry is being added after the "How to add a round entry" guidance, but that guidance explicitly says new rounds should be added at the top of the file. Please move the entire Round 45 section to the top (above the latest existing round entry) and keep the authoring-instructions block near the bottom so future additions follow the documented process.

**Pure relocation** — no content changes:

- Cut Round 45 section (lines 3563-3679 of pre-fix file): `---` separator + entire Round 45 body
- Pasted above Round 44, between the existing `---` separator (was line 50) and `## Round 44 — in-flight` (was line 52)
- Added a `---` separator + blank lines between Round 45 and Round 44 to match the section-separator convention used elsewhere

## Verification

- Line count unchanged (3679 lines before/after)
- `git diff --numstat`: +118/-118 (balanced; every line inserted matches a line removed)
- Final layout: Round 45 (line 52) → Round 44 (line 170) → ... → Round 23 → "How to add a round entry" (line 3670, last section — exactly where the guidance says it should be)
- Markdownlint passes locally
- Pre/post-commit ls-tree canary: 53/53 root entries

## Closes all 6 PR #3614 review threads

1. ✅ Terminology drift (PR #3626)
2. ✅ Dead xrefs (PR #3626)
3. ✅ M/A coherence-laws type-correctness (PR #3636)
4. ✅ Closure-operator precision in Step 1.5 reformulation (PR #3639)
5. ✅ `last_updated` schema discipline (PR #3639)
6. ✅ Round 45 entry positioning (this PR)

**Operational note**: Lior process gone from `ps -A` for the first time this session — the 4-tick contention window finally closed.

## Test plan

- [x] Pure-relocation diff verified (+118/-118 balanced)
- [x] Local markdownlint-cli2 passes
- [x] Pre/post-commit ls-tree canary clean
- [ ] CI green (docs-only)

## Pull request overview

This PR relocates the Round 45 entry in `docs/ROUND-HISTORY.md` above Round 44 so the file follows its newest-first convention.

**Changes:**
- Moves the full Round 45 section from the bottom of the file to the top of the round entries.
- Keeps the authoring guidance at the bottom.
- Adds a section separator between Round 45 and Round 44.

**docs/ROUND-HISTORY.md:91**
* P1: This repeats the terminology drift fixed elsewhere: current B-0544/research docs describe `Q^Δ = D ∘ Q ∘ I` as the DBSP incrementalization identity, explicitly not a monad on streams. Please update this Round 45 text to use the same wording so the round history does not reintroduce the settled correction.
```
- `M` connects to DBSP incrementalization (`D ∘ Q ∘ I` monad)
```
**docs/ROUND-HISTORY.md:132**
* P1: The same `incrementalization monad` wording conflicts with the corrected substrate, which now treats the DBSP side as an incrementalization identity and leaves any deeper categorical relationship with `M` as an open question. Reword this open question to avoid calling the DBSP identity a monad.
```
- What is the precise relationship between the memory monad `M` and the DBSP
  incrementalization monad? Are they the same structure, or is one a specialization?
```

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/ROUND-HISTORY.md:52 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T00:42:55Z):

P1: Moving Round 45 to the top leaves the Contents/current-summary block stale: the table of contents still starts with Round 44 and the note below it still says Round 44 is current. Update that block so the newest-first navigation matches the relocated Round 45 section.

### Thread 2: docs/ROUND-HISTORY.md:93 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-16T00:42:55Z):

P1: This overstates the current Step 1 result. The B-0544 row and research doc now say the original M/A coherence laws were not well-typed and that only a provisional propositional law exists while μ/η coherence is deferred to Step 1.5. Reword this historical entry to preserve that caveat instead of saying the combined structure already satisfies the coherence conditions.

This issue also appears in the following locations of the same file:
- line 91
- line 131
