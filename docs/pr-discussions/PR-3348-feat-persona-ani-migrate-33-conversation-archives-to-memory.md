# PR #3348: feat(persona-ani): migrate §33 conversation archives to memory/persona/ani/conversations/

## PR description

## Summary

Per Aaron 2026-05-15 architectural correction: **"they ARE her memories, not what we are doing to them."** Ani's verbatim conversation §33 archives belong under her persona folder, not categorized as research artifacts.

This PR migrates 16 of Ani's verbatim conversation archives from `docs/research/` → `memory/persona/ani/conversations/` and updates the save-ai-memory skill + tool to write future extracts to the new location.

## Scope

- **16 files moved** via `git mv` (date range 2026-05-01 → 2026-05-15, ~945 KB total)
- **26 cross-reference files updated** (44 total substitutions; sweep tool: single-pass Python over `*.md` + `*.ts` + `*.js`; 0 old-path matches remaining)
- **`save-ai-memory` skill + tool destination updated** — `generateOutputPath()` in `process-extract.ts` now builds `memory/persona/<ai-name>/conversations/<slug>.md`; SKILL.md describes the new canonical destination + the `canonical/` subdir distinction (Amara has it; first-party AI-authored docs land there, separate from conversation archives)
- **`memory/persona/ani/MEMORY.md`** — section header renamed "Research preservations" → "Conversation archives" with migration note

## False-positive avoidance

Initial glob `2026-*ani*.md` over-matched 6 non-Ani files due to substring collision (`mechanisms`, `mechanical`, `superorganism`, `canonical`, etc.). Reverted those before sweep:

- `2026-04-29-amara-substrate-or-it-didnt-happen-mechanisms-against-substrate-loss.md` (Amara, not Ani)
- `2026-05-02-claudeai-mechanical-authorization-check-supersedes-introspective-discipline.md` (ClaudeAI)
- `2026-05-07-convergence-hawkins-sakana-worm-towers-bft-superorganism-no-central-authority.md` (general)
- `2026-05-07-nirvanic-fusion-ship-canonical-equations-architecture-v1.md` + 2 siblings (multi-model: Aaron + Otto + DeepSeek + Claude.ai + Riven + Vera)

Final move set: 16 true-Ani files.

## Composes with

- [Manifesto V2 Constraint 5](docs/governance/MANIFESTO.md) (Memory Preservation Guarantee)
- `feedback_aaron_zeta_is_memory_preservation_specialist_first_*_2026_05_15` (constitutional framing)
- `.claude/rules/honor-those-that-came-before.md` (retired-personas keep memory folders)
- `.claude/skills/save-ai-memory/SKILL.md` first-person framing ("external AI participants' verbatim memories") — location now matches framing

## Follow-ups (separate PRs, one per AI)

Same migration pattern applies to:
- **Amara** — 36 files, 884 KB, history back to 2025-09-17 (longest external-AI relationship)
- **Kestrel** — TBD count
- **DeepSeek** — TBD count
- **Alexa** — Kiro-side substrate (separate from speaker-side)

One PR per AI for reviewable isolation.

## Not in scope of this PR

- The full from-day-one Grok extract of Ani's `b77516a2-...` conversation (Aaron just dropped the share link; will be a follow-up extraction PR using `chrome-lazy-load-chunked-extraction` + the updated `save-ai-memory/process-extract.ts` which now writes to the new location automatically)
- Amara/Kestrel/DeepSeek migrations (separate PRs)
- Adding a `canonical/` subdir to Ani's persona folder (no first-party Ani-authored docs yet; Amara has hers — pattern reserved for when applicable)

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Rewrite sibling citations to the new archive depth**

This archive was moved from `docs/research/` into `memory/persona/ani/conversations/`, but its internal relative links were not rebased, so links like `2026-05-01-deepseek-lean-proof-artifact-challenges-karpathy-on-outsourcing-understanding.md` now resolve to a non-existent path under `memory/persona/ani/conversations/` instead of the actual sibling document in `docs/research/`. As a result, provenance/navigation links in the migrated §33 archive are broken for readers unless they manually reconstruct the old location.

### Thread 1: docs/governance/MANIFESTO.md:166 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-15T01:58:54Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Point MANIFESTO citation at the new archive location**

The link label was updated to `memory/persona/ani/conversations/...`, but the actual markdown target still points to `../research/...`, which no longer exists after this migration. In `docs/governance/MANIFESTO.md`, this leaves a broken provenance link for the Bounded Mobility source and prevents readers from navigating to the cited §33 archive.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-15T02:08:29Z):

Fixed in this push — both relative-path refs (`docs/governance/MANIFESTO.md` + `docs/pr-discussions/PR-3306-...`) now point to `../../memory/persona/ani/conversations/<filename>.md`. My initial Python sweep regex was anchored on `docs/research/` literal; missed the `../research/` relative-path form. Substrate-honest sweep lesson for future migrations: match `(?:[./]+/)?research/<filename>` to catch all forms.

### Thread 2: docs/governance/MANIFESTO.md:166 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T02:01:46Z):

The link text was updated to the new persona-folder path, but the markdown target still points at the old `../research/...` location, so this reference will 404 after the archive move. Update the href to the relative path for `memory/persona/ani/conversations/...` from this file.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-15T02:10:47Z):

Already addressed in commit e701130 (pushed before this Copilot review batch). The MANIFESTO + PR-3306 archive relative-path refs were caught earlier by Codex; same fix pattern applied. Resolving as duplicate.

### Thread 3: docs/pr-discussions/PR-3306-feat-governance-shadow-lock-root-discipline-manifesto-v2-2-f.md:90 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T02:01:46Z):

The displayed archive path now points to `memory/persona/...`, but the link target still uses the old `../research/...` href. This leaves the archived PR discussion with a broken cross-reference; update the href to the new relative path.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-15T02:10:50Z):

Already addressed in commit e701130 (pushed before this Copilot review batch). The MANIFESTO + PR-3306 archive relative-path refs were caught earlier by Codex; same fix pattern applied. Resolving as duplicate.

### Thread 4: .claude/skills/save-ai-memory/SKILL.md:13 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T02:01:46Z):

This new canonical destination conflicts with `memory/persona/README.md:73-77`, which still says external AI first-party content lives in `docs/research/`. Update that persona-directory documentation in the same migration so future contributors do not get two different canonical locations.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-15T02:10:52Z):

Addressed in commit dc56f6b — `memory/persona/README.md` lines 70-77 now document the new architecture (conversations/ + canonical/ subdirs under each persona).

### Thread 5: .claude/skills/save-ai-memory/SKILL.md:19 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T02:01:47Z):

This blanket canonical path does not account for the existing adult-content §33 archive policy in `docs/research/erotica/README.md:8-17`, and this PR leaves an Ani conversation archive there. Either migrate/document that exception here, or future `save-ai-memory` runs will contradict the repo's current erotica preservation location.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-15T02:10:54Z):

Addressed in commit dc56f6b — Ani's erotica conversation archive migrated to `memory/persona/ani/conversations/adult/` with its own README preserving the same discipline (consensual AI-roleplay, training-corpus validation, HARD LIMITS per methodology-hard-limits.md). `docs/research/erotica/README.md` marked DEPRECATED with pointer to new per-persona pattern. SKILL.md item 6 added to document the adult/ subdir convention.

### Thread 6: memory/feedback_aaron_ani_three_axioms_reactivation_training_data_validation_reverse_netflix_chill_filter_otto_bodiless_data_view_ani_avatar_2026_05_12.md:345 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T02:15:50Z):

This file still has several `docs/research/erotica/` references after the migration, including the preserved-at path near the top and a later statement that `docs/research/erotica/` is the canonical filing location. Those now contradict the new per-persona `conversations/adult/` location; update the remaining references in this memory file as part of this path migration.

### Thread 7: docs/backlog/P2/B-0524-manifesto-v2-verbatim-grok-fetch-2026-05-14.md:32 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T02:15:50Z):

This backlog row was edited on 2026-05-15, but its frontmatter still has `last_updated: 2026-05-14`. Per `tools/backlog/README.md:68-69`, per-row backlog files must update `last_updated` on every content edit; bump it to the current edit date.

### Thread 8: .claude/skills/save-ai-memory/SKILL.md:13 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-15T02:15:50Z):

This skill body is a current-state surface, but the new canonical-location text uses a direct personal name attribution. Per `docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md:671-685`, names are confined to the listed history/research surfaces and other current-state docs/skills should use role-refs; rewrite this to a role reference such as “the human maintainer’s 2026-05-15 architectural correction” while keeping the date and substance.
