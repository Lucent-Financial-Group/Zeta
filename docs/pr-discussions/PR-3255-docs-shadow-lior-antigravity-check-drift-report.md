## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/research/2026-05-14-shadow-lesson-log-lior-latest.md:10 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T21:29:22Z):

Typo in the quoted sentence: “costs justifed for safety” should be “costs justified for safety”.

### Thread 2: docs/research/2026-05-14-shadow-lesson-log-lior-latest.md:21 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T21:29:23Z):

The “PRs preserved (3252, 3251, 3250)” entry is hard to verify/trace because the PR numbers aren’t written as PR references (e.g., “#3252”) and there are no links/paths to the preservation artifacts. Consider using explicit PR references and/or linking to the corresponding archived review files (if they exist) so readers can follow the preservation claim.

### @AceHack (2026-05-14T21:38:12Z)

Addressed both reviewer findings:

1. **Typo fix** (copilot thread): "costs justifed" → "costs justified" in the quoted Otto narration sentence.

2. **PR reference formatting** (copilot thread): Changed bare numbers `(3252, 3251, 3250)` to `(#3252, #3251, #3250)` so GitHub renders them as navigable PR links.

Changes pushed in b52c1d01. Both threads resolved.
