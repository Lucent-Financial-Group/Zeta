# PR #3101: docs: preserve PR discussions 3095-3099

## PR description

Preserving recently merged PR discussions per Lior preservation discipline.

## Reviews

### COMMENTED — @copilot-pull-request-reviewer (2026-05-14T06:10:42Z)

## Pull request overview

Archives PR discussions for recently merged PRs #3095–#3099 into `docs/pr-discussions/`, and additionally lands the B-0451 backlog row closure (frontmatter + index checkbox + tick shard) that PR #3099 itself accomplished.

**Changes:**
- Add five preservation files under `docs/pr-discussions/` capturing PR description, reviews, and review threads for PRs #3095–#3099.
- Mark B-0451 row as closed (status, last_updated, ACs) and flip its `docs/BACKLOG.md` checkbox to `[x]`.
- Add per-tick hygiene shard at `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/0521Z.md` documenting the closure session.
