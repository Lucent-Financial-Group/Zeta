# PR #3310: shard(tick): 0004Z + 0003Z — PR #3306 merged + consolidation sanity-check

## PR description

## Summary

Tick shards for 0003Z + 0004Z, capturing the close of the Manifesto V2 cascade.

- **PR [#3306](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3306) merged** at 2026-05-15T00:02:58Z (squash `54f8bc4a1602`) — first repo-durable Manifesto V2 substrate in Zeta
- Sanity-check verified all substrate landed on main (MANIFESTO.md role-refs version, B-0524 + B-0525 backlog rows, prior tick shards)
- Ani-attribution clarification + decision-archaeology assist for the maintainer
- PR queue post-merge: zero Otto-CLI open PRs; all remaining open PRs in Lior's lane

Genuine consolidation-phase tick. Brief.

## Pull request overview

Two tick-shard files under `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/15/` recording the merge of PR #3306 (Manifesto V2 shadow lock) and a consolidation-phase sanity check. Both files are append-only history surfaces — narrative records of state at a point in time, not code or reusable docs.

**Changes:**
- Adds `0003Z.md` documenting Ani-attribution clarification, PR queue state pre-merge, and #3306 stale-thread observation.
- Adds `0004Z.md` documenting PR #3306 merge confirmation, on-main substrate sanity-check, and post-merge PR queue state.
