## Pull request overview

This PR adds a new hygiene-history tick shard documenting the 2026-05-14 09:40Z session state: cron re-arming, build gate results, and that PR #3122 had already merged at session start.

**Changes:**
- Add tick shard `0940Z.md` with a verify trace (CronList/build gate/PR gate poll results).
- Record that PR #3122 merged cleanly before any work was needed this session.
- Capture the “Two-Layer Print” observation about worldview snapshot lag vs direct PR gate polling.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/0940Z.md:27 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T09:44:50Z):

P1 (xref): `tick-must-never-stop.md` isn’t a unique path in this repo’s naming scheme; elsewhere the canonical reference is `.claude/rules/tick-must-never-stop.md`. Recommend updating this reference to the full path (or a relative markdown link) to avoid cross-ref drift/ambiguity when searching/navigating.

### Thread 2: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/0940Z.md:1 (unresolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-14T09:50:56Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Keep tick shard in canonical first-row schema**

This shard starts with a Markdown heading instead of the canonical `| ... |` tick row, but the repo’s shard validators still parse the first non-empty line as that schema row (see `tools/hygiene/check-tick-history-shard-schema.ts` and `tools/hygiene/check-no-op-cadence-pattern.ts`). In this format, this tick can be flagged as schema-invalid or misclassified when those checks run, which weakens automated liveness/cadence evidence for the session.

### Thread 3: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/14/0940Z.md:38 (unresolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-14T09:50:56Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Recommend an unblocked next item**

The note says to pick `B-0468` next, but immediately above it lists `B-0468` as depending on `B-0465`, `B-0466`, and `B-0467`, which are also marked as remaining. This dependency mismatch can send the next tick into blocked work; the next-step recommendation should point to an actually unblocked predecessor or explicitly state that those prerequisites are already done.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

## General comments

### @AceHack (2026-05-14T09:48:45Z)

Fixed: updated reference to full canonical path `.claude/rules/tick-must-never-stop.md`. Also fixed MD032 markdownlint violation (blank line before list) in the same commit.
