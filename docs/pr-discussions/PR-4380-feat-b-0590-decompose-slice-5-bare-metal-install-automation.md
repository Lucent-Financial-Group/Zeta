* P2: `composes_with` repeats `B-0590` which is already listed in `depends_on`. `tools/backlog/lint-frontmatter.ts` flags this as a redundant edge; keep the stronger `depends_on` edge and drop the duplicate from `composes_with` (or vice versa if it’s not actually a hard prerequisite).

### Thread 1: docs/backlog/P2/B-0672-b0590-slice5-bare-metal-install-automation.md:7 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-19T16:15:16Z):

P1: `effort` value `M-L` doesn’t match the documented backlog schema (`effort` is `S`/`M`/`L` per tools/backlog/README.md). Please switch to a single size (or omit the field) so downstream tooling and human triage stay consistent.

This issue also appears on line 10 of the same file.

### Thread 2: docs/backlog/P2/B-0672-b0590-slice5-bare-metal-install-automation.md:11 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-19T16:15:16Z):

P1: `depends_on` references `B-0590` and `B-0671`, but there are no corresponding backlog row files/IDs in `docs/backlog/**` (and no entries in `docs/BACKLOG.md`). Either add those rows in this PR, or remove/adjust these references so dependencies point only at existing rows.
