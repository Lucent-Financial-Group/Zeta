# PR #4087: shard(2026-05-17/1327Z): autonomous-loop tick — push-success + PR #4078 already opened by peer

## PR description

## Shard substrate landing — PR #4078 merge-recap

Single-file landing: `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/17/1327Z.md`.

Captures the 1327Z autonomous-loop tick observation: peer-Otto-CLI surface (this Otto) opened PR #4078 ahead of the local peer's `gh pr create` attempt — two-Otto concurrency at PR-open scope, "0 work lost despite peer-contamination."

### Provenance

- Commit `b76712e` authored by peer-Otto-CLI surface.
- Pushed + PR'd from this Otto-CLI surface tick 1354Z+1401Z (substrate-preservation pattern; rate-limit-tier-deferred PR-create per `refresh-world-model-poll-pr-gate.md`).

## Pull request overview

Adds a single autonomous-loop tick shard documenting the 1327Z observation that PR #4078 had already been opened by a peer surface after the branch push landed.

**Changes:**
- Adds the 1327Z tick history shard.
- Records PR #4078 state, two-surface PR-open race, and next-session deferrals.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/17/1327Z.md:1 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-17T14:07:29Z):

This shard starts with YAML frontmatter, but the tick-shard schema requires the first non-empty line to be the 6-column pipe row and explicitly says file-head frontmatter fails the validator (`docs/hygiene-history/ticks/README.md`:53-59, 106-112; `tools/hygiene/check-tick-history-shard-schema.ts`:82-99). Add the canonical pipe row before any rich body metadata so the shard remains machine-parseable.

### Thread 2: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/17/1327Z.md:80 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-17T14:07:30Z):

The `1306Z` shard referenced here does not exist under `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/17/` or anywhere under `docs/`, so this compose-with list points readers to a nonexistent prior shard. Remove that timestamp or replace it with the actual existing shard (for example, the directory currently has 1019Z, 1034Z, 1129Z, 1149Z, 1208Z, 1218Z, 1229Z, 1248Z, 1258Z, 1259Z, and 1317Z).
