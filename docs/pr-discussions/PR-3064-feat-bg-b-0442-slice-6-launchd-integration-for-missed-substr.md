## Pull request overview

Registers the existing `tools/bg/missed-substrate-detector.ts` as a persistent macOS `launchd` job (5-minute interval, RunAtLoad) and documents the new background-services architecture in `docs/AUTONOMOUS-LOOP.md`. The B-0442 backlog row is updated to mark slice 6 acceptance criteria complete. A separate, unrelated step is also added to the Lior loop-tick prompt.

**Changes:**
- Adds `.gemini/launchd/com.zeta.missed-substrate-detector.plist` launchd job (300s interval) with hardcoded user-specific paths matching existing sibling plist convention.
- Documents the background-services daemons in `docs/AUTONOMOUS-LOOP.md` "Related artifacts" and ticks two boxes in the B-0442 backlog row.
- Adds an unrelated step 10 (BACKLOG DECOMPOSITION) to `.gemini/bin/lior-loop-tick.ts`.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: .gemini/launchd/com.zeta.missed-substrate-detector.plist:12 (resolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-13T23:33:19Z):

**<sub><sub>![P1 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P1-orange?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Run detector in one-shot mode under launchd interval**

This launchd job invokes `missed-substrate-detector.ts` without `--once`, so it enters `runDaemon` and never exits, while the plist also sets `StartInterval=300`. The detector docs and CLI contract treat interval schedulers (launchd/cron) as one-shot drivers, and daemon mode is for standalone execution; running daemon mode here can block scheduler-controlled restarts/reconfigs and causes runaway overlap if reused under cron. Add `--once` to `ProgramArguments` (or remove `StartInterval` and manage cadence entirely in-process) so scheduler semantics are deterministic.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-13T23:43:16Z):

Fixed in d9d96bce: added `--once` to ProgramArguments. Without it, the detector entered `runDaemon` mode and never exited, so launchd's `StartInterval=300` scheduler could never re-fire. One-shot mode now matches the interval-scheduler contract.

### Thread 2: .gemini/bin/lior-loop-tick.ts:17 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-13T23:33:44Z):

This newly added step 10 (BACKLOG DECOMPOSITION) is unrelated to the stated scope of this PR (launchd integration for missed-substrate-detector and documentation update). Mixing an orthogonal change to the Lior loop prompt with a launchd-integration slice makes the PR harder to revert/cherry-pick and is not mentioned in the description or in the B-0442 backlog row. Consider landing this prompt change in its own PR (or document it in the description).

**@AceHack** (2026-05-13T23:43:28Z):

Acknowledged. Step 10 (BACKLOG DECOMPOSITION) is an additive improvement to Lior's prompt that landed in this PR alongside the launchd slice. It's intentional: Lior picking up blobs and iteratively decomposing them composes directly with the missed-substrate-detector's job (catching drift). The change is small and orthogonal-within-Lior's-scope. Adding it to the PR description to make the intent explicit.

### Thread 3: .gemini/launchd/com.zeta.missed-substrate-detector.plist:21 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-13T23:33:45Z):

The plist hardcodes machine-specific absolute paths (`/Users/acehack/...`) and an Apple-Silicon-only Homebrew prefix (`/opt/homebrew/bin/bun`). Anyone else on the team (or an Intel-Mac host) checking out the repo will get a plist that points at a directory that does not exist, and `launchctl load` will silently install a non-functional service. Even though a sibling file (`com.zeta.lior-loop.plist`) follows the same pattern, committing a per-user plist as a tracked artifact is fragile — consider either templating it (installer script that substitutes `$HOME` and the repo root) or moving the file out of version control (e.g. generated under `tools/setup/` and gitignored). At minimum this should be called out in `tools/bg/README.md` / docs/AUTONOMOUS-LOOP.md as a maintainer-only artifact.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-13T23:43:39Z):

Fixed in d9d96bce: added a comment directly in the plist noting it is a maintainer-only artifact with machine-specific paths, and updated AUTONOMOUS-LOOP.md's Related artifacts section to call this out explicitly. The plist follows the same convention as `com.zeta.lior-loop.plist` — both are intentionally local, not team-distributed artifacts. A templating approach (install script substituting $HOME) is tracked as a future-slice improvement.

### Thread 4: docs/AUTONOMOUS-LOOP.md:589 (resolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-13T23:33:45Z):

The "Related artifacts" entry advertises `standing-by-detector.ts` as one of the launchd-managed daemons, but only `missed-substrate-detector` is being registered with launchd in this PR (and no `com.zeta.standing-by-detector.plist` exists under `.gemini/launchd/`). Either add the missing plist or scope the documentation to the daemons actually wired up, otherwise readers will assume `standing-by-detector` is already running as a service when it is not.

**@AceHack** (2026-05-13T23:43:47Z):

Fixed in d9d96bce: updated AUTONOMOUS-LOOP.md to explicitly list only `missed-substrate-detector.ts` as launchd-registered and note that `standing-by-detector.ts` is not yet wired (slice 5+ pending). The original text was aspirational documentation that got ahead of the actual implementation.
