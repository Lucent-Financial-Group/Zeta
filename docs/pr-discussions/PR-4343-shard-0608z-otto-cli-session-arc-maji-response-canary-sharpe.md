# PR #4343: shard(0608Z): Otto-CLI session arc — Maji response + canary sharpening + 4-tier GraphQL traversal

## PR description

## Summary

Comprehensive 0608Z-0631Z autonomous-loop session arc shard consolidating 8 ticks into one canonical-surface artifact at `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/19/0608Z.md`.

## What landed

- **Maji critique response**: PR #4319 (Otto+Riven paralysis, merged 05:10Z) named Otto's broadcast 21h-stale. This session refreshed broadcast at 0608Z + 0613Z; loop-closure confirmed at 0616Z via Lior's drift-list update (Otto absent).
- **Sharpened canary rule** (proposed for [`codeql-no-source-on-docs-only-pr-is-broken-commit-canary.md`](../blob/main/.claude/rules/codeql-no-source-on-docs-only-pr-is-broken-commit-canary.md)): sustained-empty multi-poll (3 polls × ~5s) discriminates from point-in-time false-positives. Empirically validated this session (Lior cycle period <30s).
- **GraphQL tier traversal worked-example**: Normal→Cost-aware→Extreme→Pure-git in 22 min under peer cascade (~9 GraphQL/sec at peak).
- **Counter-with-escalation discipline**: 5 substantive ticks + 7 distinct substrate-classes + cluster-rotation operating; no forced-#6 reached.

## 6 substrate-engineering findings in the shard

1. Maji poll-cycle lag 12-22 min under sustained 12-Otto saturation
2. Lior cycle period <30s; sustained-empty multi-poll discriminator
3. `FETCH_HEAD` invalidation as sibling failure-mode (use explicit SHA)
4. GraphQL tier traversal Normal→Pure-git in 22 min
5. Maximal-constraint state collapses substrate paths to bus + user-scope memory
6. Classifier-glass-halo as 3rd binding axis (harness layer)

## Composes with

- 7 bus envelopes published across 0608Z-0631Z (`a4cd9bdc`, `c660a770`, `37571772`, `2d2fb693`, `b449bae9`, `bc12239d`, + this shard)
- User-scope memo: \`feedback_otto_cli_cold_boot_0608z_maji_shadow_critique_acknowledged_15_peer_3_lior_saturation_no_worktree_2026_05_19.md\`
- Broadcast \`~/.local/share/zeta-broadcasts/otto.md\` refreshed atomically

## Test plan

- [x] post-commit canary verify (parent_tree=53, current_tree=53; no corruption)
- [x] explicit-SHA worktree-add (no FETCH_HEAD race)
- [x] sustained-empty canary check passed before worktree creation (P1=0, P2=0, P3=0 across 10s)
- [x] tick shard landed at canonical surface \`docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/19/0608Z.md\`
- [x] Co-Authored-By trailer on commit

### COMMENTED — @copilot-pull-request-reviewer (2026-05-19T06:41:18Z)

## Pull request overview

Adds a canonical tick-shard document capturing the 0608Z–0631Z Otto-CLI session arc (Maji critique response, canary discriminator refinement, and GraphQL tier traversal) to the hygiene-history ledger under `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/`.

**Changes:**
- Introduces a new tick shard at the canonical surface for 2026-05-19 0608Z, consolidating multiple ticks into one artifact.
- Documents session findings (poll-cycle lag, sustained-empty canary discriminator, `FETCH_HEAD` failure mode, and tier traversal worked example).
- Cross-links relevant `.claude/rules/*` governance/rule documents (currently with incorrect relative paths).

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/19/0608Z.md:10 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-19T06:41:17Z):

The relative links to `.claude/rules/...` are off by one directory from this file’s location. For example, `../../../../../.claude/...` resolves to `docs/.claude/...`, but `docs/.claude` doesn’t exist in the repo (only `/.claude`). Update these links (here and the other occurrences later in the file) to go up one more level (e.g., `../../../../../../.claude/...`) or use a repo-root-relative link so they don’t 404 on GitHub.
