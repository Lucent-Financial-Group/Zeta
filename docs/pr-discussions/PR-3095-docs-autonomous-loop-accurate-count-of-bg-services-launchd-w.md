# PR #3095: docs(autonomous-loop): accurate count of bg-services launchd-wiring status

## PR description

## Summary

The "Background Services Architecture" bullet only mentioned `standing-by-detector.ts` as not-yet-wired. The repo actually has 4 services in `tools/bg/`:

- `missed-substrate-detector.ts` (launchd-registered ✓)
- `backlog-ready-notifier.ts` (NOT wired — B-0441 #2 pending)
- `standing-by-detector.ts` (NOT wired — B-0442 slice 5+ pending)
- `audit-duplicate-row-ids.ts` (NOT wired; invoked on-demand from the substrate-hygiene cascade this session)

Updated the bullet to list all 4 + clarify that 3 are invokable on demand via `bun tools/bg/<name>.ts --once` until launchd wiring completes.

## Helper false-positive note (for follow-up)

Running the just-merged `check-md032-blanks-around-lists.ts` helper against this file surfaced 1 finding on line 275 — but markdownlint on main doesn't flag this content (the line is `- bullet` at 3-space indent inside a parent numbered-list-item-body; markdownlint sees it as sub-list of the parent block). The helper doesn't track parent-list-item-body context. Captured as a future helper-refinement class — does NOT block this docs PR.

## Test plan

- [x] Single-line text change to existing bullet; no markdownlint-actually-violating content added or modified
- [x] Substrate-honest accurate count of `tools/bg/` services and their wiring status

## Pull request overview

Updates `docs/AUTONOMOUS-LOOP.md` to accurately describe the current set of background-service scripts under `tools/bg/` and their macOS `launchd` wiring status.

**Changes:**
- Expands the “Background Services Architecture” bullet to enumerate all 4 `tools/bg/*.ts` service entrypoints.
- Clarifies which service is `launchd`-registered vs. which are currently on-demand only.

## Review threads

### Thread 1: docs/AUTONOMOUS-LOOP.md:596 (unresolved)

**@chatgpt-codex-connector** (2026-05-14T03:59:46Z):

**<sub><sub>![P2 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/P2-yellow?style=flat)</sub></sub>  Keep launchd-status note scoped to actual bg daemons**

This sentence now treats `audit-duplicate-row-ids.ts` as one of the launchd-pending background daemons, but that script is a one-shot backlog audit utility (tracked under B-0451) rather than part of the B-0440/B-0441/B-0442 daemon set; `tools/bg/README.md` also defines the current background-service set as the three detector/notifier daemons only. Grouping the audit script under the same “not yet wired to launchd” status (and tying it to B-0441/B-0442 pending work) makes the operational status inaccurate for readers trying to understand what still needs launchd wiring.

Useful? React with 👍 / 👎.

### Thread 2: docs/AUTONOMOUS-LOOP.md:597 (unresolved)

**@copilot-pull-request-reviewer** (2026-05-14T04:00:02Z):

`audit-duplicate-row-ids.ts` does not appear to support a `--once` flag (it runs once by default and exits). As written, `bun tools/bg/<name>.ts --once` would fail for that tool, so the invocation guidance should be adjusted (e.g., call it without `--once`, or qualify that only the notifier/detector tools accept `--once`).
