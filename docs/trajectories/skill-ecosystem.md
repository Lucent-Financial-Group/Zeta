# Trajectory — Skill Ecosystem

## Scope

Every skill under `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` (~250+ skills) and
every persona agent under `.claude/agents/*.md`. Open-ended because
new skills get authored when patterns emerge, existing skills go
stale when the underlying domain shifts, gaps appear when work
classes lack coverage. Bar: skills are current; gaps are flagged;
skill bloat doesn't accumulate.

## Cadence

- **Per-skill**: edits via `skill-creator` workflow only (no ad-hoc
  edits per GOVERNANCE.md §4); mechanical injection-lint fixes
  + renames are the only carve-outs.
- **Per-5-10-rounds**: `skill-tune-up` ranks top-N skills by
  tune-up urgency (drift / staleness / contradiction / bloat /
  user-pain / best-practice-drift / portability-drift).
- **Per-gap-finder-invocation**: `skill-gap-finder` scouts for
  patterns that should be skills but aren't.
- **Per-domain-shift**: when industry or repo state shifts,
  affected skills get a refresh pass.

## Current state (2026-04-28)

- ~250+ skills under `.claude/skills/`
- Persona agents at `.claude/agents/` (the named roster — see
  `docs/EXPERT-REGISTRY.md` for the full list and role-mapping)
- `skill-tune-up` ranks tune-up urgency; cites BP-NN rule IDs
- `skill-gap-finder` scouts for absent skills
- `skill-creator` is the canonical authoring workflow
- `skill-improver` acts on `skill-tune-up`'s BP-NN findings
  checkbox-style
- `prompt-protector` lints injection / invisible-Unicode (BP-10)
- Capability skills ("hats") encode HOW; persona agents encode WHO

## Target state

- Every active skill cites stable BP-NN rules where applicable.
- No skill is over the bloat threshold (~300 lines body, 3000
  words notebook).
- Drift between skills and current repo state is caught per
  `skill-tune-up` cadence.
- New skills land via `skill-creator` (no ad-hoc).
- Retired skills are recoverable via git history (per the
  honor-those-that-came-before rule — memory folders preserve;
  SKILL.md retires by deletion).

## What's left

In leverage order:

1. **`skill-tune-up` ranking refresh** — last cadenced run
   uncertain; needs activation.
2. **Skill BP-NN citation audit** — every skill should cite the
   stable rules it depends on; coverage is partial.
3. **Persona agent file freshness audit** — `.claude/agents/*.md`
   files may have stale provenance (e.g. "naming-expert review
   pending" notes that have since landed).
4. **Skill ↔ trajectory cross-reference** — every trajectory
   names skills in its Pointers; the reverse (skill → trajectory)
   isn't yet a documented invariant.
5. **`skill-gap-finder` invocation cadence** — gap-finding work
   benefits from cadence; not yet on one.
6. **Retired-skill-list audit** — git history shows retirements
   but no curated retirement-log; might be worth a thin doc.

## Recent activity + forecast

- 2026-04-28: trajectory pattern landed (this PR family) —
  static-analysis / formal-analysis / openspec-specs / docs +
  this skill-ecosystem trajectory.
- 2026-04-27: agency-signature commit-attribution work
  (`commit-message-shape` skill + AgencySignature trailers).
- 2026-04-26: counterweight-audit skill defined (Otto-278);
  cadence activation pending.
- 2026-04-26: live-lock taxonomy split (Otto-352); affects
  `skill-tune-up` mental model.

**Forecast (next 1-3 months):**

- `skill-tune-up` cadence reactivation candidate.
- New trajectory-related skill: maybe `trajectory-curator` if
  the pattern accumulates ownership.
- Wallet-experiment + EAT may produce new skill candidates
  (economic-agency, blast-radius-budgeting).
- Aurora round-3 may surface consent-layer skills.
