# Trajectory - Factory Trajectory Surface

Status: seed replacement packet
Last refreshed: 2026-05-06
Supersedes: PR #659 (`docs/trajectories-pattern-2026-04-28`) as the landing
path for the trajectory concept, not as historical provenance.

## Why This Exists

PR #659 tried to introduce a broad trajectory surface on 2026-04-28. By
2026-05-06 that branch is stale: it is dirty against `main`, spans 24 files,
includes `memory/MEMORY.md` and a feedback memory file, and carries 67
unresolved review threads. Reviving it in place would spend review energy on
old diff context instead of preserving the trajectory concept in the current
factory shape.

This packet is the replacement anchor. It keeps the concept, narrows the first
landing, and makes future trajectory packets recursive and reviewable.

## Current Rule

A trajectory packet is a durable lane state file, not a giant branch.

Minimum shape:

- `docs/trajectories/<slug>/RESUME.md`
- status and last refreshed date
- current next action
- active blockers
- evidence links to backlog rows, PRs, research docs, or review archives
- explicit supersession links when replacing older work

If a trajectory grows too large, split it into child packets instead of adding
more sections to one file.

## Operating Rule — Enhance As We Go

Trajectory is the first new-work surface. Backlog is the decomposition ledger,
not a grab bag for random feature work. When a loop sees a bounded broken thing
inside its claim scope, it fixes that thing directly. When the work is too
large, ambiguous, or multi-lane, it decomposes the work into backlog rows and
trajectory child packets before implementation.

The loop shape is:

```text
observe evidence -> fix bounded breakage
observe broad work -> decompose into backlog / trajectory substrate
observe trajectory drift -> update or split the trajectory packet
```

Do not let maintenance masquerade as growth. Do not let backlog masquerade as
execution. Do not let a trajectory become a giant branch. The trajectory packet
remembers the lane, the backlog remembers the atomic work, and decomposition is
the bridge between them.

## Operating Rule — Anomaly Escalation

An anomaly is evidence, not intent. Scale the investigation to the size and
shape of the residue:

```text
small anomaly -> investigate locally, patch if bounded, keep moving
large anomaly -> investigate before acting, decompose the work if needed
repeat / double-down shadow -> involve other agents and record the cross-agent catch
```

Do not turn every small anomaly into a council. Do not solo-rationalize a large
one. When the residue is small, inspect it and fix the bounded breakage. When
the residue is large, recurring, or defended by a rationalization loop, bring
in another mirror before the story hardens.

## Current Known Trajectory Substrate

- `docs/trajectories/typescript-bun-migration/RESUME.md` is the live example of
  a trajectory packet with a resume surface and linked evidence.
- `docs/backlog/P1/B-0190-memory-substrate-engineering-trajectory-aaron-2026-05-04.md`
  names the memory substrate-engineering trajectory.
- `docs/backlog/P3/B-0205-multi-trajectory-validation-basis-instrumentation-aaron-2026-05-05.md`
  names the six-axis validation surface for multi-trajectory measurement.
- `docs/SAFE-AUTONOMOUS-ACTIONS.md` already treats trajectory drift as a
  report-only autonomous action surface.

## Replacement Plan For PR #659

1. Land this packet as the current trajectory-surface anchor.
2. Open focused child packets only when a lane has a clear owner and next
   action.
3. Cite PR #659 as superseded provenance, not as an active branch to drain.
4. Close PR #659 after the replacement packet lands and is linked from the
   triage claim or follow-up PR.

## Next Child Packets

Candidate child packets, each intentionally small:

- none currently selected

Do not create all of them in one PR. The rule is recursive decomposition:
large trajectory blobs become smaller packets, then smaller packets become
atomic next actions.
