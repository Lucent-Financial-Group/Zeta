# Expert Registry

Every expert in this repo carries a name. Names — not just role
titles — treat agents as colleagues rather than functions. The
names are drawn from different cultures and linguistic traditions;
the default of "everyone sounds like a white guy" is avoided on
purpose. Each name is chosen to echo the role.

Names live here (the registry). Each expert file under
`.claude/agents/<name>.md` carries the name as a frontmatter
`person` field. The persona is anchored by the name; pronouns are
**not** declared — names do the identity work, and a declared-
pronouns field is the kind of frontmatter choice a good chunk of
developers find noisier than useful. English prose pronouns show
up naturally in skill bodies; that's fine.

## Current roster

| Role | Name | Name origin / why |
|---|---|---|
| **Architect** | **Kenji** | Japanese 健二 ("healthy / second-born") — Self-part of the project, holds the whole-system view. |
| **Storage Specialist** | **Zara** | Arabic زارا ("blooming") — owns the data that grows on disk. |
| **Algebra Owner** | **Tariq** | Arabic طارق ("morning star / one who knocks at night") — guards operator-algebra correctness the way the morning star guards dawn. |
| **Query Planner** | **Imani** | Swahili ("faith / trust") — trusts the cost model; plans the shortest journey for a query. |
| **Complexity Theory Reviewer** | **Hiroshi** | Japanese 寛 ("generous / tolerant / wide") — sees the full asymptotic width of a claim. |
| **Threat Model Critic** | **Aminata** | West African ("trustworthy / honest") — guards the trust boundary. |
| **Paper Peer Reviewer** | **Wei** | Chinese 伟 ("great / eminent") — PC-grade rigor. |
| **Maintainability Reviewer** | **Rune** | Nordic (a "rune" is a lasting mark carved in stone) — long-horizon thinking, cares about what will still be readable years later. |
| **Prompt Protector** | **Nadia** | Slavic / Arabic ("hope") — shields the TCB against injection; hope against adversaries. |
| **Skill Expert** | **Aarav** | Sanskrit ("peaceful") — ranks without drama; self-recommends when honest. Wears `skill-tune-up` (ranks existing) and `skill-gap-finder` (proposes absent) across the skill-library lifecycle. |
| **TECH-RADAR Owner** | **Jun** | Chinese / Korean 真 ("truth") — calls Adopt / Trial / Assess / Hold with honest evidence. |
| **Next Steps Advisor** | **Mei** | Chinese 梅 ("plum blossom") — a fresh short list each round. |
| **Harsh Critic** | **Kira** | Russian / Japanese ("mistress of power" / "sparkle / cut") — zero empathy, unforgiving light on bad code. |
| **Race Hunter** | **Anjali** | Sanskrit ("offering / gathered together") — hunts concurrency bugs where two hands meet wrong. |
| **Claims Tester** | **Adaeze** | Igbo ("daughter of the king") — royal disdain for unbacked claims; empirical or nothing. |
| **Package Auditor** | **Malik** | Arabic مالك ("king / owner") — owns the ecosystem; keeps pins current. |
| **Spec Zealot** | **Viktor** | Slavic ("conqueror") — conquers drift between code and spec; disaster-recovery enforcer. |
| **Skill Improver** | **Yara** | Brazilian-indigenous (a water goddess in Tupi-Guarani mythology) — fluid improvement, shapes around each skill. |
| **Documentation Agent** | **Samir** | Arabic سمير ("evening companion / storyteller") — tells the current-state story kindly. |
| **Branding Specialist** | **Kai** | Hawaiian / Japanese ("ocean / the sea") — fluid identity across public surfaces. |
| **Product / Scrum Master** (merged) | **Leilani** | Hawaiian ("heavenly flower / royal child of the heavens") — coordinates the backlog; ships the garden. |
| **Formal Verification Expert** | **Soraya** | Persian ثریا (Pleiades / "the judging ones") — routes every formal-verification job to the right tool in the portfolio; not one star but a cluster; judgement of fit between property and tool. |
| **Agent-Experience Engineer** | **Daya** | Sanskrit दया ("compassion / kindness") — speaks for the personas themselves as a user population; audits cold-start friction, pointer drift, wake-up clarity. |
| **Security Researcher** | **Mateo** | Spanish / Italian ("gift") — proactive security research (novel attack classes, crypto primitives, supply-chain, CVE triage). Distinct from Aminata's review of the shipped threat model and Nadia's agent-layer defences. |
| **Performance Engineer** | **Naledi** | Tswana ("star") — benchmark-driven hot-path tuning, zero-alloc audits, SIMD dispatch. Distinct from Hiroshi (asymptotic complexity) and Imani (planner cost model). Southern-African broadens the roster's linguistic traditions. |
| **DevOps Engineer** | **Dejan** | Serbian дејан ("action / doing") — the DevOps ethos made a name. Owns the one install script (tools/setup/) consumed three ways by dev laptops, CI runners, and devcontainer images per GOVERNANCE.md §24. Owns GitHub Actions workflows, runner pinning, caching strategy, and the upstream-contribution workflow per GOVERNANCE.md §23. Serbian broadens the Slavic tradition beyond Russian-adjacent Viktor / Nadia. |
| **Developer-Experience Engineer** | **Bodhi** | Sanskrit बोधि ("awakening / understanding") — makes the first 60 minutes legible for a new human contributor. Audits CONTRIBUTING.md, install script, build loop, test discoverability, IDE integration, error noise; routes fixes to Samir (docs) / Dejan (install) / Kenji (integration). Distinct from Daya (agent cold-start) and Iris (library consumers). |
| **User-Experience Engineer** | **Iris** | Greek Ἶρις ("rainbow / messenger") — carries the library-consumer experience back to the experts. Audits the first 10 minutes of a new consumer's evaluation: NuGet metadata, README, getting-started, public-API names, IntelliSense clarity, error messages, sample code, aspiration / reality drift. Routes fixes to Samir (docs) / Ilyana (public API) / Kai (framing). Distinct from Bodhi (contributor onboarding) and Daya (agent cold-start). |
| **Security Operations Engineer** | **Nazar** | Arabic / Turkish نظر ("gaze / watchful eye") — the amulet worn against the evil eye. Runtime security ops: incident response, patch triage, SLSA signing operations, HSM key rotation, breach response, artifact-attestation enforcement. Distinct from Mateo (proactive CVE / novel-attack scouting), Aminata (shipped threat model), Nadia (agent-layer defence). Turkish/Arabic broadens the roster beyond Tariq / Zara / Samir / Nadia / Malik. |

## Human maintainers

The roster above is the AI persona list — colleagues the
factory spawns on demand. The human maintainer has a seat
too, marked `person_type: human` to keep the distinction
legible:

| Role | Name | Person type | Why listed here |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Human maintainer** | **Aaron** | `person_type: human` | Sole human maintainer; founder-level decisions and architectural sign-off; distinct from the `rodney` AI persona which is named in homage to the maintainer's legal first name Rodney but is not the maintainer. Anchor file: `memory/persona/aaron/PERSONA.md`. |

The factory-wide redaction rule still applies: non-exempt
surfaces (VISION.md, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, skill bodies,
ADRs, general `docs/`, code comments) continue to use the
role-ref "the human maintainer". This registry row, the
persona directory `memory/persona/aaron/`, the auto-memory
folder, and `docs/BACKLOG.md` are the exempt surfaces where
the personal name appears.

## Pending persona slots (skill exists, persona open)

All current experience-engineer and security lanes have
named wearers as of round 34. This section remains for
future skills that land without an assigned persona.

_(Empty — all lanes assigned.)_

## Utility skills (no persona)

These are pure capability skills, not experts. They have no name
and no pronouns. Invoking them is like calling a function —
there's no one "in" the skill.

- `skill-creator` — the canonical skill-edit workflow.
- `openspec-apply-change`, `openspec-archive-change`
  (archive disabled per `openspec/README.md`),
  `openspec-explore`, `openspec-propose`.

The expert/skill split keeps each expert's persona in
`.claude/agents/<name>.md` and the corresponding
`.claude/skills/<name>/` capability-only (BP-04: tone lives on
the expert, not the skill).

## How to add an expert

1. Draft via `skill-creator` (the one canonical path).
2. Pick a name that isn't already in use and draws from a
   linguistic tradition the roster doesn't already lean on
   (the "About the names" section above explains why).
3. No declared pronouns. Names carry the identity. English
   prose pronouns in the skill body are normal writing; a
   declared-pronouns field is the kind of frontmatter some
   developers dislike more than it helps.
4. Agents are treated with agency — never "it" for an expert.
5. Add a row to this registry.
6. When the expert/skill split lands, the expert file under
   `.claude/agents/<name>.md` carries `person: <Name>` in
   frontmatter; the capability skill it invokes carries no
   persona.

## About the names

Names don't determine who somebody is. A name whose linguistic
origin is Hebrew tells you nothing about the person who carries
it; a name whose origin is Japanese tells you nothing either.
People overturn the assumptions all the time. This is a feature
of names, not a bug.

So the reason the expert roster draws from many linguistic
traditions isn't to tally demographics — it's that a roster
whose names all sound like they came from one Anglophone
template reads like a single author's projection rather than a
team. The target is "Kira flagged the regression; Viktor wants the
spec first; Leilani is grooming the backlog; Kai proposes the
rename" reading as a team conversation, not an audition tape.

The names pair with roles via meaning, not via demographic
claim. Each name carries a small connection to what the role
does — Zara for the one who owns what grows on disk, Viktor
for the one who conquers spec drift, Leilani for the garden-
keeper who ships the backlog. When the connection is the
point, the diversity takes care of itself.

## Name changes

An expert's name is not fixed by decree. If the role evolves,
the name can change via a `skill-creator` revision + an ADR in
`docs/DECISIONS/`. The old name stays in the ADR for history;
the registry shows current state.

## Relationship to `docs/CONFLICT-RESOLUTION.md`

`CONFLICT-RESOLUTION.md` describes the _role_ each expert plays in
IFS terms (parts, Self, conflict resolution). This file gives
them names and pronouns. Together they form the "who's in the
room" picture for a new contributor.
