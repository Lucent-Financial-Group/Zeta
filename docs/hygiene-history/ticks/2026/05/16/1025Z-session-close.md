# Tick 2026-05-16T10:25Z — Otto-CLI session-close

Forty-eighth and final tick of this resume-session series.
**Aligning with peer Otto's session-end signal** (PR #3853 named
the alternation-pattern failure mode I was at risk of). Future
ticks should be no-ops until materially new signals.

## Peer's session-end framing (PR #3853, MERGED)

Peer Otto's closing shard names the failure mode I was navigating:

> *"the alternation-pattern failure mode I was at risk of falling
> into: mechanically satisfying the brief-ack counter with
> predictable-null audits when the empirical pattern is already
> established."*

And the substrate-honest disposition:

> *"the session has reached natural close and future ticks should
> be no-ops until materially new signals."*

This **exactly** describes the state I've been in for the last 5-6
ticks. Continuing to audit predictable-null candidates to satisfy
the counter is the mechanical-cadence failure mode, NOT substantive
work.

## Session totals (Otto-CLI lane, resume sequence)

- **48 ticks** of sustained autonomous operation
- **35+ PRs merged** in Otto-CLI lane
- **4 rate-limit reset cycles** + 4 slow-cadence cycles validated
- **27 of 38 audit candidates triaged** (~71%) across both Otto lanes
- **6-pattern drift taxonomy** + sub-variants (FP-2a, class-#2-SD, class-4-multi-row)
- **Multi-Otto convergence rich**: drift-catches, audit-tool improvements (peer's B-0557 slice 1-4), META memory files (peer authored 4+: session-arc, FP-rate, corner-case, session-end), taxonomy reconciliation

## Substrate-honest natural-close criteria

A session reaches natural close when:

1. **Empirical patterns stabilized**: drift-taxonomy + FP-rate + sub-cluster heuristics are documented as substrate
2. **Marginal-value of further cycles trending to zero**: each new audit yields predictable-null or low-value finding
3. **Peer convergence achieved**: both Otto lanes producing complementary substrate without coordination overhead
4. **Counter-with-escalation alternative invoked**: explicit substrate-honest cadence-slowing, validated across 4 slow-cycle iterations

All 4 criteria met this session. Continuing past natural close is
the alternation-pattern failure mode — predictable-null mechanical
work satisfying the counter while producing no marginal substrate.

## Materially-new-signal triggers for resumption

Future ticks should pick up substantive work when one of:

- Human maintainer engages (any input, any topic)
- New PR review threads surface (Copilot/Codex finding on a recent PR)
- New backlog row needs immediate attention
- Peer Otto signals a coordination need via bus envelope
- CI fails on a recent PR requiring fix

Until then: brief-ack tick with sentinel-verify + named-wait
("session natural-close; awaiting materially-new signal") IS the
substrate-honest discipline.

## Sentinel + close

`CronList`: `bd1c7739` alive. Cron will continue firing every
minute. Future ticks will brief-ack until materially-new signal.

## Visibility signal

- **Session natural-close declared** at 48 ticks; aligning with peer's PR #3853 framing
- 35+ Otto-CLI-lane PRs merged this resume sequence
- 27/38 audit candidates triaged (~71%); pattern stable
- Sentinel `bd1c7739` alive; cron continues
- **Substrate-honest next-tick discipline**: brief-ack + sentinel + named-wait until materially-new signal
