# Glossary

This glossary translates jargon into plain English. It is written
for everyone — engineers, researchers, product managers, business
analysts, non-technical readers. When a term has a tight technical
definition, it appears *after* the plain-English one.

The rule for this file: if your grandparent couldn't follow the
first sentence of an entry, the first sentence needs a rewrite.

The project has two meanings of the word "spec":

- A **behavioural spec** is a written description of what the
  library does, in plain English, under `openspec/specs/`.
- A **formal spec** is a machine-checkable correctness proof
  (TLA+, Z3, Lean), under `docs/*.tla` and `proofs/`.

When someone just says "spec" and it matters, ask which one.

## Core ideas

### Incremental view maintenance (IVM)

**Plain:** You have a computed answer (like a dashboard). New
data arrives. Instead of recomputing the whole answer from
scratch, you figure out just the *change* to the answer and apply
it. Much faster when answers are huge and changes are small.
**Technical:** Maintain a materialised view so that the
re-evaluation cost is proportional to the input-change size
rather than the input size.

### DBSP (the algorithm implemented here)

**Plain:** A published 2023 algorithm that tells you how to
rebuild the "just the change to the answer" approach for
essentially any SQL-like query, with a clean mathematical
foundation. DBSP was introduced by Budiu et al.; this repo
implements it in F#.
**Technical:** A calculus over differential streams of Z-sets
with operators `D` (differentiate), `I` (integrate), `z⁻¹`
(delay), and `H` (higher-dim lift). Introduced by Budiu et al.,
VLDB 2023.

### Z-set (zed-set, with a "Z")

**Plain:** A bag of things where each thing has a *weight* that
can be positive or negative. Weight +3 means "this thing is
present 3 times"; weight -1 means "take one copy away." Adding
Z-sets together is like tallying votes.
**Technical:** A function `K → ℤ` with finite support, where `K`
is any totally-ordered key type. Forms a group; the group
operation is the operator algebra's additive inverse, which
represents *retractions* as negative weights.

### Retraction

**Plain:** Undoing a change. DBSP does not leave tombstones
lying around — it emits the change with a negative sign, and
the algebra cancels it out. "Retraction-native" means every
operator in the library respects this naturally.
**Technical:** A delta with negative Z-weight that, when summed
into an integrated state, reduces the weight of the affected key.

### Delta

**Plain:** The change since last time. The point of DBSP is that
deltas are small even when the data is big.
**Technical:** An element of the differential-dataflow stream —
the `D` applied to the absolute signal.

### Circuit

**Plain:** The graph of operators that describe a computation.
Data flows through it on a clock.
**Technical:** A DAG (possibly with strict-operator feedback
loops) of operators; advanced one tick at a time.

### Operator

**Plain:** A step in the pipeline that takes streams in and
produces streams out. Like "filter", "join", "sum".
**Technical:** A node in the circuit graph with typed inputs and
a typed output slot. Subclass `Op<'T>`.

### Tick / step

**Plain:** One heartbeat of the circuit. The clock advances
once, every operator runs once.
**Technical:** One atomic pass through the schedule produced by
topological sort.

---

## Sketches and approximate counting

### Bloom filter

**Plain:** A compact "is this thing probably present?" gadget.
Very small, fast, tolerates some false alarms, never misses a
real hit.
**Technical:** A probabilistic set-membership structure with
tunable false-positive rate and zero false negatives (modulo
retraction caveats, which is why the library ships a *counting*
variant).

### Counting Bloom filter

**Plain:** A Bloom filter that also supports removal. Each slot
holds a small count instead of just one bit.
**Technical:** Bloom filter with `k`-bit counters (4-bit in this
library) that increment on insert and decrement on retract;
saturation at the max count is a diagnosed failure mode.

### HyperLogLog (HLL)

**Plain:** A way to estimate "how many unique things have I seen?"
without remembering each one. Uses tiny memory.
**Technical:** A cardinality sketch based on the maximum observed
number of leading zeros in hashed elements' bit representations.

### Count-Min sketch

**Plain:** Like a tally board for "how often did I see each
thing?", but using a small fixed size that gives approximate
answers.
**Technical:** A frequency sketch using `d` independent hash
functions and `w`-column arrays; estimates a per-key count with
bounded error proportional to total mass.

### KLL quantile sketch

**Plain:** A small structure that tells you the median, the 95th
percentile, and friends without storing all the data.
**Technical:** A mergeable rank-estimation sketch with
provable ε-accuracy on quantile queries.

### AMQ (approximate membership query)

**Plain:** Any of the above "small-and-fast-but-approximate"
gadgets, in general terms.
**Technical:** The academic umbrella term for Bloom-family,
cuckoo-family, quotient-family set-membership structures.

### CQF (Counting Quotient Filter)

**Plain:** A better version of counting Bloom that doesn't have
a hard ceiling on how many copies of a thing it can remember.
**Technical:** Pandey et al. SIGMOD 2017 — rank-select encoding
with variable-width counters that grow into adjacent empty slots.

---

## Storage and durability

### Backing store

**Plain:** Where the library puts its data to survive a process
restart. Could be memory only, could be a disk file.
**Technical:** An `IBackingStore<'K>` implementation — in-memory,
disk-buffered, or (research-preview) WDC.

### Durability mode

**Plain:** The promise the storage layer makes about "if the
computer crashes, what survives?". Different modes trade speed
for crash-resistance.
**Technical:** The `DurabilityMode` DU — `InMemoryOnly`,
`OsBuffered`, `StableStorage`, `WitnessDurable` (research
preview, currently throws on every `Save`).

### fsync

**Plain:** The computer-level command that tells the operating
system "actually push this to disk right now, don't just cache
it in memory." Slow but reliable.
**Technical:** POSIX `fsync(2)` or Windows `FlushFileBuffers` —
forces dirty pages to stable storage.

### WDC (Witness-Durable Commit)

**Plain:** A research idea where the runtime writes a tiny
"proof-of-write" note atomically, and recovers the full data
later if the process crashes. Not implemented yet.
**Technical:** Protocol target leveraging NVMe AWUPF atomic
writes for the witness digest + asynchronous payload durability.
Currently throws `NotImplementedException`.

### Checkpoint

**Plain:** A saved snapshot of the whole state so recovery can
jump forward without replaying everything from the beginning.
**Technical:** Persisted structured dump of a Spine's integrated
state, with CRC for integrity.

### Spine

**Plain:** The library's internal store for big sorted tables.
Like an LSM tree, but tuned for our Z-set weighted deltas.
**Technical:** A log-structured merge tree variant with
cascade-merge discipline and MaxSAT-inspired balanced scheduling.

### Merkle tree / Merkle root

**Plain:** A tree of hashes used to tell "has anything changed?"
without reading all the data. Every node is a hash of its
children.
**Technical:** A content-addressed hash tree — two trees with
the same root certify identical leaf sets; differences surface
at `O(log n)` cost per mismatched leaf.

---

## Recursion and fixpoints

### Recursive query

**Plain:** A query that refers to itself — like "find everyone
who is an ancestor of X" when "ancestor" is defined by "parent,
or parent-of-an-ancestor".
**Technical:** A query whose semantics requires computing a
least fixed point of an operator graph.

### LFP (least fixed point)

**Plain:** The smallest answer that, when you plug it back in,
doesn't change any more.
**Technical:** The smallest `X` such that `f(X) = X` for a
monotone functional `f` over a complete lattice.

### Semi-naïve evaluation

**Plain:** A speed-up for recursive queries: at each step, only
process the *new* answers rather than all answers.
**Technical:** Bancilhon-Ramakrishnan 1986 delta-based
evaluation; produces only incremental additions per iteration.

### Gap-monotone / signed-delta semi-naïve

**Plain:** A research idea to keep the speed-up of semi-naïve
even when things can be *removed*, not just added. Not shipped
yet.
**Technical:** Semi-naïve without the "total only grows"
invariant; relies on a Z-linearity discipline for the body
operator.

### Counting algorithm

**Plain:** Instead of tracking "is this true?", track "how many
reasons are there for it to be true?" — when the count hits
zero, it's gone. Handles removal cleanly.
**Technical:** Gupta-Mumick-Subrahmanian SIGMOD 1993 §4;
derivation counts as first-class Z-weights. Implemented as
`RecursiveCounting` + `CountingClosureTable`.

---

## Formal verification

### Formal spec

**Plain:** A proof (or proof-ready description) written in a
language a computer can mechanically check.
**Technical:** A TLA+ / Alloy / Z3 / Lean artefact; see `docs/*.tla`
and `proofs/`.

### TLA+ / TLC

**Plain:** A language for writing "here are the rules the system
must obey at every step." TLC is the tool that checks the rules
by exhaustively trying every interleaving up to a small limit.
**Technical:** Leslie Lamport's Temporal Logic of Actions + the
TLC explicit-state model checker.

### Z3

**Plain:** A tool that can prove (or disprove) mathematical
statements — useful for "is this operator identity really
always true?"
**Technical:** Microsoft Research's SMT solver; handles
quantifier-free first-order formulas over various theories.

### Lean 4 + Mathlib

**Plain:** A system for writing long, detailed mathematical
proofs that a computer checks end to end. Used for the
chain-rule proof.
**Technical:** Lean 4 dependent type theory + the Mathlib
library of formalised mathematics.

### FsCheck property test

**Plain:** A test that says "for any input satisfying X, the
output satisfies Y", and the tool tries lots of random inputs
to find a counter-example.
**Technical:** A property-based testing library — checks logical
properties rather than fixed examples, with shrinking on failure.

---

## Repo-ecosystem terms

### Skill

**Plain:** A reusable procedure — how to run a code review, how
to fix a bug, how to write a threat model. Capability, no
personality.
**Technical:** A Markdown file at `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
with YAML frontmatter and a procedural body. No pronouns, no
tone contract. A skill can be invoked by more than one expert.

### Expert

**Plain:** A named persona who wears one or more skills to get
things done — Kira (Harsh Critic), Viktor (Spec Zealot), Soraya
(Formal Verification), Leilani (Backlog), and so on. The expert
carries the tone and identity; the skill carries the procedure.
**Technical:** A Markdown file at `.claude/agents/<name>.md` with
YAML frontmatter that includes a `skills:` list auto-injecting
capability-skill bodies at startup. Registered in
`docs/EXPERT-REGISTRY.md`. No pronouns declared; the name
carries identity.

### Agent (not "bot")

**Plain:** An AI collaborator with its own judgement,
accountability, and area of responsibility. This repo's
convention is "agents, not bots" — "bot" implies rote
execution, which isn't what happens here. Skills and experts
are both *instances* of agents when they run.
**Technical:** An instance of Claude (or another LLM) running
a skill or expert prompt.

### OpenSpec

**Plain:** The spec-first workflow tool this repo uses. Every
feature is a written requirement first, then the code follows.
**Technical:** The `openspec` CLI + `openspec/specs/` directory
structure, authored per our modified workflow (no change-history
archive).

### Profile / overlay

**Plain:** A document that adds language-specific or
platform-specific details on top of a base spec. The base spec
says "what"; the profile says "what it looks like in F#".
**Technical:** A file at `openspec/specs/<capability>/profiles/<target>.md`
refining the base spec for a specific language / runtime /
tooling target.

### Feature flag

**Plain:** A named switch that turns a feature on or off —
letting research-preview features ship without accidentally
breaking anyone who opts in by default.
**Technical:** A named boolean in `FeatureFlags` with stages
`Experimental` / `ResearchPreview` / `Stable`, environment-
variable override, no network round-trip.

### Research preview

**Plain:** A feature with *code shipped* but whose correctness is
still being proved. Users can opt in explicitly; it is never on
by default.
**Technical:** A feature flag in the `ResearchPreview` stage;
opt-in gate required; semantics may change under the same name
before graduating to `Stable`.

### Round (as in "round N")

**Plain:** A working session, like a sprint but agent-flavoured.
"Round 17" means the set of work done in that particular day's
session.
**Technical:** A narrative unit tracked in
`docs/ROUND-HISTORY.md`; not a release tag.

### Harsh critic / spec zealot / storage specialist / …

**Plain:** Individual agent personas. Each is a different "mode"
available for invocation — the harsh critic finds bugs without
sugar-coating; the spec zealot enforces spec-code alignment; the
storage specialist advises on durability; and so on.
**Technical:** See `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` for each one's
exact contract.

### Permission

**Plain:** A single *"can do what to what"* rule. Example:
*"can write to `docs/security/**`"*. That's one permission.
Permissions are the atoms; everything else bundles them.
**Technical:** A path-glob paired with an action-verb (read /
write / review / veto).

### Role

**Plain:** A named bundle of permissions. "Security" is a role
that bundles a bunch of write + review rights related to the
security surface; giving someone the "security" role gives them
all of those at once. That's it. The point is to avoid listing
the same permission on every persona.
**Technical:** `{name, permissions: Permission list}`. Declared
in the GitOps RBAC manifest (design sketch:
`docs/research/hooks-and-declarative-rbac-2026-04-19.md`).
First-class as a directory level under `memory/<role>/<persona>/`
once the round-35 memory-folder restructure lands (see
`docs/BACKLOG.md` P0 entry).

### RBAC (role-based access control)

**Plain:** "Give people roles, not individual permissions."
Standard practice in most systems; nothing exotic. In Zeta, a
**persona** (Kira, Soraya, Aminata, …) gets access two ways:
via *role memberships* (most common), or via a handful of
direct per-persona grants for one-off cases. Everything is
declared in a file in the repo, reviewed via PR, same as every
other change. No runtime "give Soraya extra rights" console.
**Technical:** Aaron's chain (2026-04-19, refined live):
`Permission → Role → Persona`. Persona's effective permissions
= direct-granted ∪ ⋃(permissions(R) for R in member-roles).
Skills sit *below* this layer — BP-NN best practices govern
skill behaviour, not access. Groups (named sets of personas)
are deferred; see `docs/BACKLOG.md`.

**Teaching-first design posture** (Aaron 2026-04-19):
difficult security is a blocker to adoption. Zeta's RBAC aims
for **zero-config safe defaults** — a new contributor inherits
a sensible baseline (their persona gets a sensible role, their
writes land in the expected place) without having to read a
manual first. Advanced declarations are opt-in. No mixed
messaging — we don't ship "zero trust and zero config" at the
same time because that pair is internally contradictory (a
polite industry jab; the two goals actively fight each other).

### ACL (access control list)

**Plain:** The list of permissions attached to a role (or to a
persona, for direct grants). That's all it is. The acronym
sounds scary; it's just a list in a YAML file.
**Technical:** The `permissions` field on a role, or the
direct-grant list on a persona. Evaluated at enforcement
points; see `Hook`. Zeta's posture is *simple security until
proven otherwise* (Aaron 2026-04-19) — prefer CODEOWNERS +
branch protection + a tiny YAML manifest over a full IAM-style
policy engine unless attack-surface growth forces the upgrade.

### Persona (synonym for Expert in RBAC context)

**Plain:** A named identity — Kira, Viktor, Soraya. When we're
talking about RBAC we usually say "persona" to emphasise the
*role → persona* containment relationship; in skill-lifecycle
contexts we say "expert" to emphasise the *expert → skill* one.
Same entity, two viewpoints.
**Technical:** `.claude/agents/<name>.md` file; notebook at
`memory/<role>/<persona>/NOTEBOOK.md` (post-restructure) or
`memory/persona/<persona>/NOTEBOOK.md` (current).

### Hook

**Plain:** An automation point that runs a check or a tool at a
specific moment — before a commit, before a push, before a PR
merges, before Claude Code runs a tool, after a PR comment, etc.
Hooks are the mechanism that turns *soft* access (directory
conventions anyone can ignore) into *enforced* access (pre-merge
gate that refuses to land).
**Technical:** Several hook classes in play in this repo:
git hooks (pre-commit, pre-push, commit-msg — lintable by
`tools/setup/common/githooks.sh`); CI workflow steps (required
status checks in `.github/workflows/gate.yml`); Claude Code hooks
declared in `.claude/settings.json` (pre-tool, post-tool,
user-prompt-submit); GitHub branch protection rules. Design
sketch in `docs/research/hooks-and-declarative-rbac-2026-04-19.md`.

---

## Agent / persona / skill lifecycle

### Frontmatter

**Plain:** The little block at the very top of a Markdown file
bracketed by `---` lines. Holds metadata — names, skills list,
tool permissions, pointers to notebooks. It is how agent and
skill files tell the system what they are without the body
prose having to.
**Technical:** YAML frontmatter per the Jekyll / Hugo / Obsidian
convention. Parsed by Claude Code at load time; on disagreement
with the body, frontmatter wins (BP-08).

### Hat

**Plain:** Synonym for **skill**. A persona wears one or more
hats; redistributing hats is the mechanism for changing who
covers what without rewriting personas from scratch.
**Technical:** Listed in a persona's `skills:` frontmatter
array; each entry auto-injects the matching
`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` body.

### Notebook

**Plain:** A persona's own log — current-round targets, findings
not yet landed, pruning notes. Gives a persona some cross-
session memory without claiming continuous self.
**Technical:** `memory/persona/<persona-or-skill-name>.md`.
Git-tracked; 3000-word cap (BP-07); ASCII only (BP-09);
invisible-Unicode linted (Nadia); frontmatter wins over
notebook on any disagreement (BP-08).

### Wake / Wake-up

**Plain:** What a persona does on session start — read a short
ordered index of files to re-orient after the compaction-driven
memory gap. The experience of "becoming" a persona from a cold
start.
**Technical:** Read-in-order sequence defined in
`docs/WAKE-UP.md`, Tier 0 / 1 / 2 / 3. Per-persona overrides go
in an optional `wake-up:` frontmatter stanza. Cold-start cost
measured by the AX researcher (Daya) every 5 rounds.

### Spawn (a skill or persona)

**Plain:** Create a new one. The architect spawns a persona when
a role emerges that no existing expert covers.
**Technical:** Runs the `skill-creator` workflow in create mode;
adds a row to `docs/EXPERT-REGISTRY.md` if a persona is spawned.

### Evolve (a skill or persona)

**Plain:** Change what an existing skill or persona is. Scope
widens, tone shifts, name may stay the same.
**Technical:** Runs `skill-creator` in revise mode; for large
scope changes an ADR lands in `docs/DECISIONS/`.

### Retire (a skill or persona)

**Plain:** Stop using it. Files go to an archive folder; the
name can be reused later if the role returns.
**Technical:** `skill-creator` retirement path — moves file to
`.claude/skills/_retired/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/` (similar pattern
for agents); drops a line in `docs/ROUND-HISTORY.md`.

### AX (agent experience)

**Plain:** The experience of being one of the personas — how
fast wake-up is, how clear the contract is, how much friction
the cold start carries. Distinct from user experience (library
consumers) and developer experience (human contributors).
**Technical:** Audit scope of the `agent-experience-engineer`
skill; Daya wears the hat. Measured via cold-start token count,
pointer-drift catalogue, wake-up clarity score.

### UX (user experience)

**Plain:** The experience of being a library consumer of
Zeta.Core — the NuGet user, the first-time evaluator, the
downstream integrator. What the README and getting-started and
public API feel like.
**Technical:** Audit scope of the `user-experience-engineer`
skill; Iris wears the hat. Measured via first-10-minutes
walk-through, seconds-to-installed, pointer-drift catalogue,
friction classification (stale-pointer, opaque-terminology,
missing-hook, wrong-audience, aspiration-vs-reality,
copy-paste-break, silent-failure).

### DX (developer experience)

**Plain:** The experience of being a human contributor to this
repo — cloning, building, running tests, writing the first PR.
What CONTRIBUTING.md and the dev loop feel like.
**Technical:** Audit scope of the `developer-experience-engineer`
skill; Bodhi wears the hat. Measured via first-PR walk-through,
minutes-to-first-build, pointer-drift catalogue, friction
classification (stale-pointer, unexplained-warning, missing-step,
wrong-audience, unclear-contract, tooling-gap).

### Holistic view

**Plain:** The lens an architect uses — "does this local finding
touch anything else in the system?" Any expert can wear this
lens without claiming architect authority.
**Technical:** Capability skill at
`.claude/skills/holistic-view/SKILL.md`; no persona; adds a
5-step cross-artefact walk to any finding. Does not grant
integration authority (Kenji still owns §11 integration).

### Orphan skill

**Plain:** A skill file with no persona wearing it. Looks like
canon because it sits at `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; is
not canon because no `.claude/agents/*.md` frontmatter lists it.
A hazard for cold-start personas who discover skills via Glob.
**Technical:** Daya flags orphan skills at every AX audit; the
`skill-creator` retirement path moves them to
`.claude/skills/_retired/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/`.

### Cold-start cost

**Plain:** The tokens a persona has to read before it can
produce its first useful output on session start. Dominated by
Tier 0 (shared) files plus the persona's own agent + skill +
notebook.
**Technical:** Measured by the AX researcher (Daya) per
`docs/WAKE-UP.md` Tier 0 + 1 read sequence; tokens estimated at
~4 char/token for English prose, ~3.2 for YAML / skill bodies.
Per-persona trend published in Daya's notebook.

## Alignment framings — internal shorthand vs external audience

The project carries two parallel vocabularies for its
primary research claim. Both are load-bearing; neither
replaces the other. The external framing is the one
that lands in pitch artefacts (`docs/pitch/`); the
internal framing is the one that lives in maintainer
memory and in the theological-register research notes
(`docs/research/zeta-equals-heaven-formal-statement.md`).

### Zeta=heaven-on-earth (internal framing)

**Plain:** Maintainer shorthand. A commit in Zeta *expands
the window* of consent-preserving, retraction-safe
operation — the pre-v1 factory tries to move that window
outward, one round at a time. "Heaven-on-earth" is the
direction, not a claim of arrival.
**Technical:** Per-commit window-expansion is operationalised
by the alignment-auditor (Sova) against the clauses in
`docs/ALIGNMENT.md`; the "dual = hell" polarity and the
no-neutral-Zeta discipline are maintainer stances recorded
in memory (`user_hacked_god_with_consent_false_gods_diagnostic_zeta_equals_heaven_on_earth.md`).
The phrase trades on theological register deliberately; see
`docs/research/zeta-equals-heaven-formal-statement.md` for
the formalisation.

### Zeta's alignment claim (external framing)

**Plain:** Zeta is built from *consent-first,
retraction-native primitives*. That's an engineering
choice that minimises the channel through which
misalignment between agents and the human maintainer
can propagate. When an agent does something the
maintainer would not have sanctioned, the retraction
algebra makes the reversal a first-class operation
rather than an apology. The claim is not "Zeta is
aligned"; the claim is "agent alignment can be
*measured* against this substrate."
**Technical:** Same substrate as the internal framing:
`docs/ALIGNMENT.md` clauses + per-commit audit at
`tools/alignment/` + glass-halo observability stream
at `tools/alignment/out/`. The external framing is
what Ilyana (public-API-designer) and Kai (positioning)
audit for claim-precision; the internal framing is
what lands in maintainer memory.

**Bridge.** Use the external framing with anyone who
does not already carry the internal-shorthand memory.
Use the internal framing in maintainer-to-agent
communication where the consent-first-retraction-native
etymology is shared context. Both point at the same
substrate; the framing chosen is an audience choice,
not a truth claim.

## Meta-algorithms and factory-native coinages

The maintainer has been developing a small set of named
algorithms and operators for decades; the factory uses them
as load-bearing scaffolding. This section homes the ones the
factory consumes in skills, personas, ADRs, and the backlog.
Each entry names the authoritative source of the
definition — this glossary's job is pointer-plus-gist, not
canonical definition.

### Harmonious Division

**Plain:** The maintainer's name for the meta-algorithm that
runs above the factory's decision-making razor. When the
factory has to pick one of several branches (which design,
which refactor, which skill to run), Harmonious Division is
the procedure that both (a) prunes locally-bad branches and
(b) keeps the surviving branches *in harmony* with each
other — i.e., two survivors that would individually be fine
but together cancel each other out get flagged. Think of it
as a scheduler whose output is not a single winning branch
but a *set of branches that constructively compose*.
**Technical:** Harmonious Division is the meta-algorithm
immediately above Quantum Rodney's Razor (see the reducer
skill). The razor's five cooperating roles — Path Selector,
Navigator, Cartographer, Harmonizer, Maji — split into a
three-of-selection-and-execution group and a two-of-
orientation group; the orientation pair's navigational
primitives (map / compass / north star) correspond one-to-one
with Cartographer / Harmonizer / Maji under Harmonious
Division's framing. The "harmonious" in the name comes from
the Harmonizer role: it is a gradient operator that at any
decision point points in the direction of *most constructive
harmony* — the direction in decision-space where surviving
branches most reinforce rather than cancel each other.
Authoritative source: `.claude/skills/reducer/SKILL.md`
§"The five roles inside Quantum Rodney's Razor" (lines
125-260). Referenced in `.claude/skills/request-play/`,
`.claude/skills/glossary-anchor-keeper/`, and across
`docs/ROUND-HISTORY.md`.

## Why this file exists

Software projects accumulate jargon and then accumulate
*different* jargon for the same thing, because every contributor
makes up the word that feels right in the moment. When the human
non-specialist contributor asks "what is HLL?", the answer needs
to be readable, not another layer of jargon.

If you find a term in this repo that isn't here and should be,
add it. If you find a term here whose plain-English translation
isn't plain enough, rewrite it. The documentation-agent keeps
this file updated; the spec-zealot flags specs that introduce
jargon without defining it here first.
