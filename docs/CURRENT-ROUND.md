# Current Round — 26 (open)

Live mid-round state file. Kenji overwrites per architect
turn; reset at round-close. Round 25 closed on 2026-04-18;
narrative absorbed into `docs/ROUND-HISTORY.md`.

## Status

- **Round number:** 26
- **Opened:** 2026-04-18 (carries over directly from
  round 25's close in the same session)
- **Classification:** still a rename-tail round — finish
  NAMING.md phases 9-15 + pick up round-24 deferred items
  (Tariq, Rune, Yara, Kenji self-audit). Not yet a feature
  round.
- **Reviewer budget:** 2-3 per AGENTS.md §13 (backlog
  still heavy)
- **Architect turn count:** 0 (not yet started)

## Round-25 carry-over

Everything the Zeta rename left on the floor at phase B8:

- **NAMING.md phases 9-15**
  - Phase 9: test content deep-sweep (paths, fixture
    references)
  - Phase 10: BenchmarkDotNet / CI / Stryker residue
    re-audit
  - Phase 11: docs final polish — grep whole repo for
    `[Dd]bsp` and confirm every match is paper /
    theorem / `DbspSpec.tla`
  - Phase 12: TLA+ filenames audit
  - Phase 13: remove NAMING.md "pending" banner
  - Phase 14: final smoke (`dotnet test`, `dotnet run
    --project samples/Demo`)
  - Phase 15: retire `docs/drafts/zeta-rename-plan.md`
    (promote any lingering learnings to the canonical
    docs first)

- **Round-24 dispatches still open**
  - Tariq on IsLinear predicate strengthening (DEBT
    options a/b/c)
  - Rune on `docs/STYLE.md` decision
  - Yara via skill-creator on Aarav BP-10 cite at
    `skill-tune-up-ranker/SKILL.md:117`
  - Kenji first self-audit via Daya's procedure (freedom
    #5)

## Machine state (per round-management §3.5)

- **In flight:** none (round just opened).
- **Heavy-command holders:** none.
- **Ports claimed:** none.

## Open asks to the maintainer

- **`src/Dbsp.CSharp`** — empty dir on disk, not in sln.
  Delete, rename to `Zeta.CSharp`, or populate?
- **NuGet prefix reservation** on `nuget.org` for `Zeta.*`
  — maintainer owns; pursue in parallel to phase 14 or
  defer?
- **`global.json` `rollForward`** — status quo vs relaxed
  (silent-pick status quo unless objection).
- **Eval-harness MVP scope** — still pending since round
  23; propose or park?
- **WINS.md ordering** — currently oldest-first (round 21
  → 24 top-to-bottom); flip to newest-first, or keep as
  celebration-archive exception?
- **Commit timing** — maintainer said "a few rounds" from
  round 25 open; the rename is largely landed. Signal when
  ready to `git init` + first commit.

## Next architect actions (this round)

1. Finish NAMING.md phases 9-13 (low-risk mechanical).
2. Phase 14 smoke test — full `dotnet test`, sample run,
   whole-repo `[Dd]bsp` grep audit.
3. Retire `docs/drafts/zeta-rename-plan.md` after phase
   14 lands.
4. Dispatch Tariq / Rune / Yara in parallel as machine-
   safe short tasks.
5. Kenji self-audit pass (freedom #5) — first time.
6. Round-close when remaining items clear.

## Architect last-left-off (for wake-up)

Round 26 just opened at round-25 close. Zeta rename arc
landed through phase B8 with build gates holding
`0W / 0E` at every checkpoint. Hidden-memory purge ran
via documentation-agent dispatch. Memory policy codified
in AGENTS.md §18 with both-layer architecture + newest-
first + four durable feedback memories. Remaining round-25
items (dispatches, phases 9-15) carry over as round-26
scope.

## Notes for the next Kenji waking in this round

- Do not run `git init` or commit until maintainer says
  go. See `feedback_git_timing.md`.
- The rename is ~85% done; the rest is phases 9-15
  (test/doc polish + smoke) — low-risk mechanical work.
- Build gate per source-touching phase, same as round 25.
- Per-persona notebooks read before shared memory on
  wake-up; newest-first across all logs.
- Path hygiene: no absolute filesystem paths or paths
  outside repo root in docs. See
  `feedback_path_hygiene.md`. AGENTS.md §18 is the sole
  memory-folder path reference.
