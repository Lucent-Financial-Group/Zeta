# Branch cleanup record — 2026-09-09

Deletion record for the remote-head sweep of `Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta`.
Every branch below was **tagged before it was deleted**, so a tip SHA is enough
to restore it: `git push origin <sha>:refs/heads/<branch>`. Text, per
`.claude/rules/no-binary-in-proof-lineage.md`. Same shape as
[`branch-cleanup-2026-08-25.md`](branch-cleanup-2026-08-25.md).

Workitem: `081M24DW4G0087G0R000MD0QEP`.

## Why

> "we need to cleanup all these branches again." — the maintainer, 2026-09-09

## Totals

| category | count |
|---|---:|
| remote heads before | 162 |
| remote heads after (measured 2026-09-10T01:13:23Z) | 127 |
| **deleted by this sweep** | **34** |
| merged + auto-deleted by GitHub mid-sweep (not this sweep) | 3 |
| pushed by another agent mid-sweep, never triaged | 2 |
| protected, never examined for deletion | 62 |
| kept with a stated reason | 63 |
| archive tags created by this sweep | 19 |
| archive tags reused from the 2026-09-03 sweep | 15 |

`162 - 34 - 3 + 2 = 127`, re-measured against `git ls-remote --heads origin`
after the deletes, not inferred from the push output.

## Protected namespaces — never examined (62)

| namespace | count | why |
|---|---:|---|
| `preserve/*` | 31 | a preservation namespace itself |
| `heartbeat/*` | 29 | frozen telemetry lanes; frozen is not abandoned |
| `liveness/observations` | 1 | the observation ledger |
| `main` | 1 | default branch |

`archive/*` **tags** (449 before this sweep, 468 after) were likewise never a
deletion candidate.

## The gate each deleted branch passed

This repo squash-merges, so `git branch -r --merged origin/main` returns **zero**
non-protected branches and ancestry proves nothing. Each deletion rests on one of
four positive tests, plus a tag:

1. **P — already preserved.** The 2026-09-03 sweep created an `archive/*` tag for
   the branch and the tag SHA still **equals the current tip**, so the tip was
   already archived; only the delete had not happened.
2. **A — stale claim lease.** The branch's whole diff is one
   `docs/claims/<slug>.md` marker and its last commit is more than 24 h old, which
   is the documented **force-release** condition in
   `docs/AGENT-CLAIM-PROTOCOL.md#stale-claims-and-force-release`.
3. **B — superseded v1.** The branch's PR is CLOSED-unmerged and a **named
   successor PR merged** (`-v2` / `-2` / `-3`), and the content check below finds
   no basename it adds that is absent from `main`.
4. **C — merged, and the post-merge tip verified.** The branch's PR is MERGED and
   either the merged head **equals** the current tip, or every commit past the
   merged head was found on `main` by subject search, with the landing PR named.

No branch with an **OPEN** PR was deleted; see the falsifier finding below.

## Deleted — group P: tagged 2026-09-03, tag SHA == tip, delete never ran (15)

| branch | tip | tag |
|---|---|---|
| `claim/081ktqx7w6q08qg0r000-otto-2026-08-24` | `424fa4502b3f` | `archive/2026-09-03-branch-sweep/...` |

| `otto/telemetry-zetaid-shards` | `81351e0ddfd9` | `archive/2026-09-03-branch-sweep/...` |

Nine of the fifteen are also group A (marker-only stale claim leases) and one,
`codex/browser-zetadb-startup-hydration`, carries content the basename gate calls
UNLANDED — it is deleted on the **prior sweep's** already-executed preservation
judgement, not on a fresh content check.

## Deleted — group A: stale claim lease, marker-only (1 not already in P)

| branch | tip | diff vs main | last commit | tag |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `claim/task-character-evolution-20260908` | `6f04bcec6cef` | 1 file, 12 insertions | 2026-09-08 17:31 (>24 h) | `archive/2026-09-09-branch-sweep/claim/task-character-evolution-20260908` |

Superseded by `claim/task-character-evolution-20260909`, which is **under 24 h
old and therefore an ACTIVE lease** — kept.

## Deleted — group B: closed-unmerged v1, named successor merged (13)

Each is tagged `archive/2026-09-09-branch-sweep/<branch>`.

## Deleted — group C: merged PR, post-merge tip verified on main (5)

| branch | tip | merged PR | evidence for the commits past the merged head |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cursor/zflash-cli-bao-flags-27c5` | `a9fc6245a461` | #16813 | none — tip **equals** the merged head |
| `otto/nci-and-headscale-raw-manifests` | `7224d5d9e0a6` | #16696 | `base_domain must not contain server_url's host` landed as **#16720** |
| `otto/opensearch-defer-on-live-measurement` | `349c12bd1ad1` | #16662 | both trailing commits recovered by **#16669** ("two commits auto-merge left behind") |
| `otto/recover-opensearch-fix` | `3bd565b890cd` | #16669 | `drift goes GREEN ... headscale moves home` landed as **#16675** |
| `shadow/retire-three-stale-branch-claims` | `f7e095c70a2c` | #16478 | `pigeonhole :156 and n3 doc point at docs/derivations/` landed as **#16487** |

Each is tagged `archive/2026-09-09-branch-sweep/<branch>`.

## Kept, with the reason (63 triaged, plus 2 that appeared mid-sweep)

### Open PR at triage time — must survive (11; one merged mid-sweep)

### Live lane / active lease (2)

- `agent-heartbeats` — **a live heartbeat lane** carrying thousands of
  `heartbeat(...)` commits. It is not under `heartbeat/*` and so is not caught by
  the usual exclusion; treat it as protected. Its PR #5470 merged long ago and the
  tip has advanced by the whole lane since.
- `claim/task-character-evolution-20260909` — claim lease **under 24 h old**, i.e.
  ACTIVE under `docs/AGENT-CLAIM-PROTOCOL.md`. Deleting it would force-release a
  live claim.

### Unlanded content, no PR — the 2026-09-07/08 codex/wip/claim swarm (31)

Not sweepable, and worth a maintainer decision rather than a sweep: these carry
real durable content absent from `main` with **no PR open to land it**. Several
are very large (`codex/mixed-message-epoch-integration-20260908` adds 1300+ files;
`claim/task-compiled-capture-five-publication-20260907` adds 2566).

### Merged PR, but the tip advanced and the extra commits were NOT found on main (4)

Each has a merged PR **and** post-merge commits whose content could not be shown to
have landed. Group C's test failed for them, so they are kept:

| branch | merged PR | unverified commit |
|---|---|---|
| `otto/serve-tree-dev-rung-v2` | #16543 | `the lane-tree ConfigMap needs a SERVER-side apply` |
| `shadow/credential-rotation-verb` | #16952 | `make rotation EASY — the awkwardness bought no safety` |
| `shadow/first-metal-findings-register` | #17001 | `correct two findings the maintainer reframed` |
| `shadow/repo-split-plan` | #16837 | `the language repos are CHALLENGERS to the IR, not legacy` |

### Closed-unmerged with no merged successor found (8)

`cursor/lumen-unique-confirm-16678-77c2` #16681 ·
`cursor/lumen-unique-confirm-16678-fa0b` #16679 ·
`feat/zetafs-unwrap-oracles-mac-hsm` #16194 · `io-boundary-treaty` #16449 ·
`shadow/capability-ratchet-benchmark` #16845 ·
`shadow/deprecated-chart-is-a-finding` #16357 ·
`shadow/ratchet-benchmark-ohms-regimes` #16847 ·
`shadow/triangle-corner-meter` #16849

`io-boundary-treaty` is the odd one in its family: its five siblings from the same
2026-09-02/03 session all got a merged `-v2`, and it did not. Its tip subject is
`the transcript generator failed the blocking eslint gate`.

### No PR, provenance clear but landing unverified (8)

`archive/nci-emitter-capability-20260906` · `feat/zetafs-groupcommit-blockio` ·
`feat/zetafs-posix-object-skip-existing` · `otto-16696` ·
`otto/nci-higher-resolution-2026-09-05` ·
`shadow/joiner-control-plane-label-is-async` ·
`shadow/k3s-joiner-label-async-retry` · `shadow/triangle-meter`

Two branches appeared **during** this sweep and were never triaged: `pr-inspect-tool` and `security/tranche6-npm-advisories`. The repo is live; every count here carries its measurement time.

`archive/nci-emitter-capability-20260906` is a **branch** sitting in the
`archive/*` name, which is the tag-side preservation namespace. It is kept, and
the collision is flagged below rather than resolved by a sweep.

## Findings — three defects this sweep surfaced

### 1. `triage-orphan-branches.ts` classes OPEN-PR branches as prunable

`src/Core.TypeScript/hygiene/triage-orphan-branches.ts` gates only on content
(*"a branch is SAFE iff it adds no basename absent from main"*). It never asks
whether the branch has an **open PR**. Measured here: its SAFE set contained
`agent/face-lattice-flake-081M243GZ19087G0R001F914Q4` (PR #17184, open at the time)
and `agent/unrun-flake-eval-checks-081M243GZ19087G0R001F914Q4` (#17187, open).
Running it with `--prune` at that moment would have deleted the head refs of two
live PRs. Both were excluded here by intersecting the SAFE set with an
open-PR list read over REST before any delete.

### 2. The basename gate produces FALSE SAFEs on generated-log corpora

The same gate says SAFE when every basename a branch adds already exists somewhere
on `main` — a *name* collision, not a content one. On the 2026-09-07/08 custody-log
corpus (files called `001.gz`, `producer-00-0.json.gz`, and similar) this fires
constantly. `claim/task-compiled-capture-five-publication-20260907` was classed
**SAFE** while carrying **2566 files / 23286 insertions** absent from `main`;
`claim/task-compiled-prerequisites-publication-20260907` likewise at 2314 files.
No branch was deleted on that signal alone: the executed set required a merged PR,
a named merged successor, a >24 h marker-only claim lease, or a prior sweep's tag.

### 3. The 2026-09-03 sweep tagged 15 branches and never deleted them

Fifteen `archive/2026-09-03-branch-sweep/*` tags point at SHAs that were **still
the live branch tips** six days later. Preservation ran; the delete did not. A
delete that silently fails reads as success, which is why this record re-lists the
remote and confirms absence rather than trusting the push output.

### 4. The pre-push floor hook cannot tell an archive tag from a contract change

`scripts/hooks/pre-push` refused
`archive/2026-09-09-branch-sweep/feat/zetafs-pr{6,7}-*` with
`BLOCKED (treaty-byte-lock-vectors)`. For a **new** remote ref the hook scopes its
scan to `merge-base(tip, origin/main)..tip` — its own comment says "scope to
commits not already on any origin ref", but the code only consults `origin/main`.
An archive tag names commits that are **already published** (each target was
verified with `git branch -r --contains`, which returned the branch itself), so the
push transferred zero objects and changed no vector on any lane. Pushed with
`ZETA_FLOOR_VECTORS_ACK=1` on that basis, recorded here rather than left silent.

The fix is one condition — skip the scan when `local_sha` is already reachable from
an existing `origin/*` ref — and it belongs to whoever owns the hook.

## What was deliberately NOT touched

- **`preserve/*` (31), `heartbeat/*` (29), `liveness/observations`, `main`** — never
  listed as candidates.
- **`archive/*` tags** — read, never written over, never deleted.
- **`agent-heartbeats`** — a live heartbeat lane outside the `heartbeat/*` prefix.
- **Every branch with an open PR.**
- **The 31-branch codex/wip/claim swarm of 2026-09-07/08** — real unlanded content
  with no PR. A sweep is the wrong instrument; these need landing or an explicit
  `release: <slug> - abandoned` per the claim protocol.
- **Anything whose landing could not be shown** — the four merged-PR branches with
  unverified trailing commits, the eight closed-unmerged branches with no successor,
  and the eight no-PR branches above.

## How to restore any row

```
git push origin archive/2026-09-09-branch-sweep/<branch>^{}:refs/heads/<branch>
```

For the fifteen group-P rows substitute `archive/2026-09-03-branch-sweep/<branch>`.
