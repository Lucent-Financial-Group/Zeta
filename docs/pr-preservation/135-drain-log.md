## First-wave drain (10 threads, pre-merge)

### Thread 1 — `docs/BACKLOG.md:714` — Memory citations not in repo (Codex P2)

- Reviewer: chatgpt-codex-connector
- Thread ID: `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58x0GX`
- Severity: P2
- Outcome: **STALE-RESOLVED-BY-REALITY** — both cited memory files
  (`user_aaron_itron_pki_supply_chain_secure_boot_background.md` and
  `feedback_external_signal_confirms_internal_insight_second_occurrence_discipline_2026_04_22.md`)
  exist in-tree at HEAD per Otto-114 forward-mirror landing.

### Thread 2 — `docs/research/arc3-dora-benchmark.md:286` — "Aaron" name attribution (Copilot)

- Reviewer: copilot-pull-request-reviewer
- Thread ID: `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58x3E2`
- Severity: P1
- Outcome: **OTTO-279 SURFACE-CLASS** — research surfaces (`docs/research/**`)
  permit first-name attribution for both human contributors and named agents
  per Otto-279 surface-class refinement; rule applies to current-state
  surfaces (skill bodies, code, README, public-facing prose), not history
  surfaces. Resolved with surface-class explanation.

### Thread 3 — `docs/research/arc3-dora-benchmark.md:300` — Typo "citeable" (Copilot)

- Reviewer: copilot-pull-request-reviewer
- Thread ID: `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58x3FT`
- Severity: P2
- Outcome: **FIX** — `citeable` → `citable` (commit `fbd9284`).

### Thread 4 — `docs/research/arc3-dora-benchmark.md:268` — Subject-verb agreement (Copilot)

- Reviewer: copilot-pull-request-reviewer
- Thread ID: `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58x3Fp`
- Severity: P2
- Outcome: **FIX** — `scores ... is` (subject "scores" plural with verb "is"
  singular) reworded to `scoring framework ... is` per the suggested
  rephrase. Commit `fbd9284`.

### Threads 5-10 — Memory file dangling citations (Copilot + Codex, multiple)

- Thread IDs: `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58x3GK`, `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58x3Gd`,
  `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58x3Gv`, `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58x3HB`,
  `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58x3HO`, `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58x42u`
- Severity: P2
- Outcome: **STALE-RESOLVED-BY-REALITY** — all six threads cite the same
  pair of memory files now present in-repo per Otto-114 forward-mirror.
  PR description's "memory files exist and are findable" claim is
  accurate against current main. Verified via `ls memory/`.

## Second-wave drain (1 P1 + 3 P2 post-merge cascade)

### Thread A — `docs/research/arc3-dora-benchmark.md:285` — DORA canonical definitions (Codex P1)

- Reviewer: chatgpt-codex-connector
- Thread ID: `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59kH-8`
- Severity: P1
- Finding: prior wording redefined DORA as "deploy-frequency counts commits
  reaching prod; change-failure-rate counts incidents," which would skew
  cross-run measurements under different batch sizes / incident-volume
  baselines. Canonical Google/Accelerate DORA: deployment frequency =
  deployments to production; change failure rate = failed deployments /
  total deployments.
- Outcome: **FIX** — adopted canonical framing with explicit parenthetical
  noting the distinction from commit / raw-incident counts. Factory-
  instantiation table at L158 (per-tick translation) intentionally
  preserves the commits-per-tick mapping; the L283 fix targets the
  canonical-definition bullet only. Commit `6854187`.

### Thread B — `docs/research/arc3-dora-benchmark.md:272` — "devops" capitalization (Copilot P2)

- Reviewer: copilot-pull-request-reviewer
- Thread ID: `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59kJSk`
- Severity: P2
- Outcome: **FIX** — `devops-delivery` → `DevOps-delivery` matching the
  doc's own earlier expansion of "Google DevOps Research and Assessment".
  Commit `bccfd2b`.

### Thread C — `docs/BACKLOG.md:775` — "well-defined-Occam's discipline" undefined (Copilot P2)

- Reviewer: copilot-pull-request-reviewer
- Thread ID: `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59kJSn`
- Severity: P2
- Outcome: **FIX** — added inline definition: "Rodney's Razor: prefer the
  simplest generator output that still satisfies the operator-algebra
  invariants — a constraint-narrowing prior over generator hypothesis
  space." Composes with Rodney's existing `reducer` skill at
  `.claude/skills/reducer/`. Commit `bccfd2b`.

## Pattern observations (Otto-250 training-signal class)

1. **Otto-279 surface-class as a uniform mature reply pattern.** The
   "Aaron name in research doc" thread on this PR was the third instance
   in this drain wave (others on #219, #377). Each got the same
   one-paragraph stamp: surface-class identification + provenance-vs-
   policy distinction + carve-out citation. Discipline reads as one-line
   answer to recurring concern.

2. **Stale-resolved-by-reality at ~70% on this PR.** 7 of 14 total
   threads (10 first-wave + 4 second-wave) were "doc claims X, but X
   is actually true now per Otto-114 forward-mirror" or "fix already
   landed in a downstream commit." The reply pattern is verify-with-
   evidence + resolve, not re-fix.

3. **Codex-as-mathematics-reviewer on canonical definitions.** The DORA
   P1 finding on L285 caught a real correctness issue on a benchmark
   doc — the prior wording would have skewed Stage-2 measurements under
   different batch sizes. This is the same shape as the K-relations
   retraction-limitation finding on #206 (semirings-vs-rings precision
   error) — Codex catches subset-vs-superset framing errors reliably.

## Final resolution

All 14 threads resolved (10 first-wave merged at SHA `fbd9284`, then
4 second-wave at `bccfd2b`). PR auto-merge SQUASH armed throughout;
both BLOCKED states cleared via CI; PR merged at `49f7ebc` to main.

Drained by: Otto, post-summary autonomous-loop continuation, cron
heartbeat `f38fa487` (`* * * * *`).
