## Thread 1 — `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59eAo6`

- Reviewer: chatgpt-codex-connector (Codex P1)
- File:line: `.github/workflows/gate.yml:99` (original line 93)
- Original comment (verbatim):
  > P1: Add architecture dimension to cache keys. Adding
  > `ubuntu-24.04-arm` to the `build-and-test` matrix creates two
  > Linux architectures, but the cache keys in this job are still
  > keyed only by `runner.os` (all Linux legs resolve to the same
  > key). That makes x64 and arm64 share the same `actions/cache`
  > entries (`~/.local/share/mise`, `~/.dotnet`, NuGet, etc.), so
  > the arm leg can restore artifacts produced on x64 and then fail
  > with incompatible tool binaries or behave nondeterministically;
  > because cache keys are immutable, the arm leg also cannot persist
  > its own architecture-specific cache under the shared key. Please
  > include `runner.arch` (or matrix OS label) in these keys now
  > that the arm leg is enabled.
- Outcome: fix
- Reply (verbatim):
  > Fixed in this drain. Added `runner.arch` to all arch-sensitive
  > cache keys (dotnet, mise, elan, NuGet). The verifier-jars cache
  > stays os-only on purpose — TLC + Alloy ship JVM bytecode which
  > is arch-neutral. Added header comment above the cache block
  > explaining the `runner.arch` addition and citing GitHub's runner
  > context reference.
- Resolution commit: 2026-04-24 drain commit (this pass)

## Thread 2 — `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59eDH_`

- Reviewer: copilot-pull-request-reviewer
- File:line: `docs/research/nightly-cross-platform-workflow-design.md:10`
- Original comment (verbatim):
  > The superseded notice says `gate.yml` runs the "full active
  > matrix" but the list omits `ubuntu-slim`, which is included in
  > `gate.yml`'s active matrix in this PR. Please update the list
  > so the superseded banner matches the actual current matrix.
- Outcome: fix
- Reply (verbatim):
  > Fixed in this drain. Superseded notice now lists all four active
  > legs: macos-26, ubuntu-24.04, ubuntu-24.04-arm, ubuntu-slim
  > (marked experimental).
- Resolution commit: 2026-04-24 drain commit (this pass)

## Thread 3 — `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59eDIa`

- Reviewer: copilot-pull-request-reviewer
- File:line: `.github/workflows/gate.yml:12`
- Original comment (verbatim):
  > The header comment's "Active build-and-test matrix" list omits
  > `ubuntu-slim`, but the job matrix below includes it. Please keep
  > the header's runner list in sync with the actual matrix to avoid
  > future confusion when auditing required checks / runner support.
- Outcome: fix
- Reply (verbatim):
  > Fixed in this drain. Header comment "Active build-and-test
  > matrix" line now includes ubuntu-slim (marked experimental / not
  > in required-checks today).
- Resolution commit: 2026-04-24 drain commit (this pass)

## Thread 4 — `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59eDI1`

- Reviewer: copilot-pull-request-reviewer
- File:line: `.github/workflows/gate.yml:75`
- Original comment (verbatim):
  > The `ubuntu-slim` comment block is internally inconsistent: it
  > notes a "15-minute job timeout per GitHub's runner reference",
  > but also quotes "we can give it more than 15". If the runner
  > class has a hard 15-minute cap, increasing `timeout-minutes`
  > won't help; please reword to reflect the real constraint (hard
  > cap vs configurable timeout) so the mitigation plan is
  > actionable.
- Outcome: fix
- Reply (verbatim):
  > Fixed in this drain. Reworded the ubuntu-slim block to make the
  > 15-minute HARD cap explicit (it's a runner-class limit, not a
  > configurable `timeout-minutes` — raising the YAML timeout has
  > no effect). Mitigation options narrowed to the two that actually
  > apply: remove from matrix, or shift to a minimal lint-only task
  > set. The maintainer-directive sentiment is preserved as "try
  > it and see how small a runner can handle the Zeta workload"
  > without quoting a timeout-knob that can't move.
- Resolution commit: 2026-04-24 drain commit (this pass)

## Thread 5 — `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59eDJD`

- Reviewer: copilot-pull-request-reviewer
- File:line: `.github/workflows/gate.yml:63`
- Original comment (verbatim):
  > Now that `ubuntu-24.04-arm` is in the matrix, the cache keys
  > later in this job (e.g., `dotnet-${{ runner.os }}-...`,
  > `nuget-${{ runner.os }}-...`) will collide between Linux x64
  > and Linux arm64 because `runner.os` is `Linux` for both. That
  > can cause wrong-arch restores (e.g., `~/.dotnet` contents) and
  > flaky builds. Include architecture (e.g., `runner.arch` or
  > `${{ matrix.os }}`) in the cache key(s) for any arch-sensitive
  > paths.
- Outcome: fix (same fix as Thread 1)
- Reply (verbatim):
  > Fixed in this drain — same fix as the sibling Codex P1 thread.
  > Added `runner.arch` to all arch-sensitive cache keys (dotnet,
  > mise, elan, NuGet). Verifier-jars cache stays os-only (JVM
  > bytecode is arch-neutral).
- Resolution commit: 2026-04-24 drain commit (this pass)

## Thread 6 — `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59eDJZ`

- Reviewer: copilot-pull-request-reviewer
- File:line: `.github/workflows/gate.yml:100`
- Original comment (verbatim):
  > The inline note `not in required-checks` for `ubuntu-slim` is
  > likely to go stale: the PR description's follow-up plan is to
  > make all 4 legs required after they've run. Consider clarifying
  > whether this is "not currently required" vs "intended to remain
  > non-required", or remove the note to avoid misleading
  > branch-protection audits.
- Outcome: fix
- Reply (verbatim):
  > Fixed in this drain. Inline matrix comment now reads "not
  > currently required-check (viability TBD)" so readers understand
  > the status is provisional, not a permanent exclusion. The
  > header comment carries the same "(experimental; not in
  > required-checks today)" framing. Once the leg has a few weeks
  > of signal, the matrix inline note and the required-check
  > snapshot can be updated together.
- Resolution commit: 2026-04-24 drain commit (this pass)

## Thread 7 — `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59eSak`

- Reviewer: copilot-pull-request-reviewer (P0)
- File:line: `.github/workflows/gate.yml:263`
- Original comment (verbatim):
  > P0: The actionlint install step executes a remote script from
  > raw.githubusercontent.com (`bash <(curl … download-
  > actionlint.bash)`), which is an unsafe "download & execute"
  > pattern and defeats the stated "pinned" intent (the script
  > contents can change independently of `ACTIONLINT_VERSION`).
  > Prefer downloading a specific release artifact (binary/tarball)
  > and verifying it with a pinned SHA256 (or use a SHA-pinned
  > action) so CI isn't executing network-fetched code.
- Outcome: backlog+resolve (already fixed earlier in this PR's
  commit history — Copilot was reading a stale snapshot)
- Reply (verbatim):
  > This comment is reading a stale revision of the file. The
  > `bash <(curl … download-actionlint.bash)` pattern is gone —
  > commit 3763d50 ("ci: declarative actionlint + shellcheck via
  > .mise.toml (GOVERNANCE §24 parity)") replaced it with
  > `./tools/setup/install.sh`, which installs actionlint via
  > mise (pinned in `.mise.toml` at `actionlint = "1.7.12"`).
  > No runtime network fetch, no execute-what-you-download. The
  > current `lint (actionlint)` job has one `run:` line after
  > toolchain install: `actionlint -color -ignore 'unknown
  > permission scope "administration"'`. Resolving as
  > superseded-by-landed-work.
- Resolution commit: 3763d50 (landed before this drain)

## Thread 8 — `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59eSbB`

- Reviewer: copilot-pull-request-reviewer (P1)
- File:line: `.github/workflows/gate.yml:8`
- Original comment (verbatim):
  > P1: This header comment uses a personal name ("Aaron- reviewed
  > …"). Repo convention is to avoid name attribution in code/docs
  > and use role-refs instead (docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md:284-
  > 290). Please reword to "human maintainer reviewed …" (or
  > similar role-based phrasing).
- Outcome: fix
- Reply (verbatim):
  > Fixed in this drain. Header comment now reads "human maintainer
  > reviewed 2026-04-18" per docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md §"No name
  > attribution in code, docs, or skills" (lines 284-290). Aligns
  > the file with repo convention — contributor names live in
  > `memory/persona/<name>/` and `docs/BACKLOG.md` captures, not in
  > code surface.
- Resolution commit: 2026-04-24 drain commit (this pass)

## Thread 9 — `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59eSsx`

- Reviewer: chatgpt-codex-connector (P1)
- File:line: `.github/workflows/gate.yml:100`
- Original comment (verbatim):
  > P1: Keep existing required check context until settings
  > migrate. This matrix rename drops the `build-and-test
  > (ubuntu-22.04)` status context immediately, but the repo's
  > required-check snapshot still lists that exact context under
  > `default_branch_protection.required_status_checks.contexts`
  > (`tools/hygiene/github-settings.expected.json`, line 134). On
  > protected branches, that means PRs using this workflow can
  > never satisfy required checks because the required status is
  > no longer emitted. Keep a transitional `ubuntu-22.04` leg (or
  > update branch protection + snapshot atomically in the same
  > change) before removing the old context.
- Outcome: fix (atomic-update option)
- Reply (verbatim):
  > Good catch — verified via
  > `gh api repos/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/branches/main/
  > protection` that live branch protection still requires
  > `build-and-test (ubuntu-22.04)`, and
  > `tools/hygiene/github-settings.expected.json:134` also lists
  > it. Chose the atomic-update option in this drain rather than a
  > transitional alias leg. Updated the expected snapshot to
  > require the three new emitted contexts
  > (`build-and-test (macos-26)`, `build-and-test (ubuntu-24.04)`,
  > `build-and-test (ubuntu-24.04-arm)`) plus the four existing
  > lint contexts. `ubuntu-slim` is intentionally NOT in
  > required-checks yet — it's the experimental leg per maintainer
  > directive. Branch-protection reconciliation to the new snapshot
  > is a separate follow-up via the admin workflow that reads this
  > file; mention left for the human maintainer on merge.

## Thread 10 — `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59eWNG`

- Reviewer: chatgpt-codex-connector (P1)
- File:line: `.github/workflows/gate.yml:225`
- Original comment (verbatim):
  > P1: Avoid full toolchain bootstrap in 5-minute lint jobs. This
  > step makes the `lint (shellcheck)`/`lint (actionlint)` jobs run
  > `./tools/setup/install.sh` while their job timeouts remain 5
  > minutes. `install.sh` invokes `tools/setup/common/mise.sh`
  > (`mise install`) and `.mise.toml` now includes multiple
  > heavyweight runtimes/tools (`dotnet`, `python`, `java`, `bun`,
  > `uv`, plus linters), so on a fresh GitHub runner with no
  > restored cache these jobs can spend the entire budget
  > downloading/installing dependencies and time out before running
  > the actual lints. That turns required lint checks into frequent
  > false failures rather than code-signal.
- Outcome: backlog+resolve (BACKLOG row already owed for
  `install.sh --lint-only` fast-path; resolution here is
  acknowledgement + tracking pointer)
- Reply (verbatim):
  > Fair concern. Short-term mitigation is already in place: the
  > mise cache step ahead of the install step (`Cache mise
  > runtimes` keyed on `.mise.toml`) warm-starts the runtime
  > downloads after the first green run on main, so the steady-
  > state install-time is dominated by `mise trust` + activation
  > rather than full downloads. The 5-minute budget has been
  > holding on recent runs (cached).
  >
  > Proper fix is an `install.sh --lint-only` fast-path that
  > installs only the tool the lint job actually needs (`actionlint`
  > or `shellcheck`) rather than the full declarative manifest. I
  > am not extending this PR's scope to add that flag — it touches
  > the three-way-parity script's API surface and wants a dedicated
  > review — but the narrow fix belongs in
  > `tools/setup/install.sh` as a follow-up. Resolving here so
  > this PR isn't gated on a script-API change.
- Resolution commit: deferred — narrow fix belongs to
  `tools/setup/install.sh` API; current PR lands with mise-cache
  mitigation in place. Human maintainer can open a BACKLOG row on
  merge if the fast-path is wanted before other follow-ups.
