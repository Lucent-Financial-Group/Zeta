## Thread 1 — `memory/project_operator_input_quality_log_directive_2026_04_22.md:4` — name attribution

- Reviewer: `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`
- Thread ID: `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59dhwU`
- Severity: P1

### Original comment (verbatim)

> P1: The standing "no name attribution" rule says contributor names belong only under `memory/persona/<name>/` (and optionally `docs/BACKLOG.md`). This new memory entry uses the maintainer's personal name in narrative/frontmatter; please convert narrative references to role-refs (keeping verbatim quotes intact) or move name-specific content under `memory/persona/` (docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md:284-292).

### Outcome

DEFER+RESOLVE — narrow scope covered by the existing comms-hygiene sweep BACKLOG row. The rewrite touches 17 name occurrences interwoven with verbatim quotes; a dedicated focused PR (preserving quote text, replacing only narrative prose) is the right shape rather than smuggling it into Stream A+C.

### Reply (verbatim)

> Deferring to `docs/BACKLOG.md` "Comms-hygiene sweep: strip name attribution" row (line 2398) — owned by `documentation-agent` (Samir). This memory file has 17 Aaron references interwoven with verbatim quotes; the sweep will preserve verbatim quotes while rewriting narrative prose. Keeping this narrow-out here so Stream A+C stays scoped.

## Thread 2 — `src/Core/SignalQuality.fs:171` — allocation in compressionRatio

- Reviewer: `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`
- Thread ID: `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59dhw0`
- Severity: P1

### Original comment (verbatim)

> P1: `compressionRatio` allocates the entire compressed payload via `MemoryStream.ToArray()` just to read its length, adding avoidable allocations/copies. Use `out.Length` (after flushing/disposing the `GZipStream`) instead of materializing the byte array so the ratio computation stays allocation-minimal.

### Outcome

FIX — replaced `out.ToArray()` byte-copy with `out.Length` read after the inner-scope dispose of the `GZipStream`.

### Reply (verbatim)

> Fixed. Inner-scope dispose flushes the `GZipStream`, then we read `out.Length` directly — no byte-array materialization. Comment updated to document the scoping rationale.

## Thread 3 — `src/Core/SignalQuality.fs:422` — composite NaN + zero-weight

- Reviewer: `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`
- Thread ID: `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59dhxK`
- Severity: P0/P1

### Original comment (verbatim)

> P0/P1: `composite` treats any NaN finding as poisoning even when that dimension's weight is `0.0` (or missing, which you map to `0.0`). This prevents callers from disabling a dimension via weights. Consider only propagating NaN when the corresponding weight is nonzero/positive (and optionally ignore non-positive weights entirely).

### Outcome

FIX — gated the NaN-poisoning (and the weighted-sum accumulation) on `w > 0.0`, so callers can disable a dimension by assigning a zero weight without the disabled dimension's NaN poisoning the composite.

### Reply (verbatim)

> Fixed. NaN-poisoning + weighted-sum accumulation are now gated on `w > 0.0` — zero-weight (including the missing-dimension-maps-to-0.0 path) means "disabled", so a NaN from that dimension does not poison the composite. Matches the "weighted mean" docstring.

## Thread 4 — `.claude/commands/btw.md:9` — name attribution

- Reviewer: `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`
- Thread ID: `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59dhxZ`
- Severity: P1

### Original comment (verbatim)

> P1: Repo operational rule forbids direct contributor names in code/docs/skills; this command doc uses the maintainer's personal name in narrative prose. Please switch narrative references to role-refs (e.g., "human maintainer"), preserving any verbatim quotes as-is (docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md:284-292).

### Outcome

FIX — replaced narrative `Aaron` references with `the maintainer` / `the human maintainer`; the verbatim quote in the "Why this command exists" block is preserved as-is.

### Reply (verbatim)

> Fixed. All narrative `Aaron` references switched to role-refs (`the human maintainer` / `the maintainer`). The verbatim quote in the "Why this command exists" block is preserved as quoted text, per the rule's verbatim-quote carve-out.

## Thread 5 — `src/Core/SignalQuality.fs:36` — Amara reference in header

- Reviewer: `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`
- Thread ID: `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59dhxu`
- Severity: P1

### Original comment (verbatim)

> P1: Repo operational rule forbids direct contributor names in code/docs/skills; this header comment references a named person ("Amara") in non-verbatim narrative. Please replace with a role reference or a document/spec title per docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md:284-292.

### Outcome

FIX — removed the two `Amara` references in the XML-doc header and in the Compression-dimension comment; replaced with `the spec` / `the bullshit-detector design spec`.

### Reply (verbatim)

> Fixed. The two `Amara` narrative references (module header + Compression dimension section comment) are now role-refs (`the spec` / `the bullshit-detector design spec`).

## Thread 6 — `samples/ServiceTitanCrm/ServiceTitanCrm.fsproj:4` — company-specific sample name

- Reviewer: `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`
- Thread ID: `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59dhyD`
- Severity: P1

### Original comment (verbatim)

> P1: Repo convention is to keep open-source samples generic (no company-specific `samples/ServiceTitan*/` dirs/namespaces). This project's `RootNamespace` is company-specific; please rename the sample project/dir/namespace to a generic CRM demo name (see memory/feedback_open_source_repo_demos_stay_generic_not_company_specific_2026_04_23.md:59-66).

### Outcome

FIX — renamed `samples/ServiceTitanCrm/` → `samples/CrmSample/`, `ServiceTitanCrm.fsproj` → `CrmSample.fsproj`, `RootNamespace` → `Zeta.Samples.CrmSample`, module → `Zeta.Samples.CrmSample.Program`. `.sln` project name + path updated to match. Build passes.

### Reply (verbatim)

> Fixed. Directory, project file, namespace, module, and `.sln` entry all renamed to `CrmSample`. Build is 0W/0E against the rename.

## Thread 7 — `samples/ServiceTitanCrm/Program.fs:2` — company-specific module

- Reviewer: `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`
- Thread ID: `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59dhyQ`
- Severity: P1

### Original comment (verbatim)

> P1: This module name bakes a company-specific sample name into the repo. Per the repo's "samples stay generic" rule, please rename the sample/module to a generic CRM demo name and adjust the folder/project accordingly (memory/feedback_open_source_repo_demos_stay_generic_not_company_specific_2026_04_23.md:59-66).

### Outcome

FIX — module declaration changed to `module Zeta.Samples.CrmSample.Program`; see Thread 6 for the surrounding rename.

### Reply (verbatim)

> Fixed. Module is now `Zeta.Samples.CrmSample.Program`. Same rename batch as Thread 6.

## Thread 8 — `Zeta.sln:30` — FactoryDemo missing x64/x86 mappings (Codex)

- Reviewer: `chatgpt-codex-connector`
- Thread ID: `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59di9Z`
- Severity: P2

### Original comment (verbatim)

> **Add missing x64/x86 mappings for FactoryDemo project**
> This commit introduces `Debug|x64/x86` and `Release|x64/x86` solution configurations, but `ProjectConfigurationPlatforms` still has entries for `FactoryDemo.Api.FSharp` (`{40534D09-439E-4E5F-9A69-A73844DB674D}`) only under `Any CPU`. In x64/x86 solution builds (e.g., Visual Studio config switch or `Platform=x64/x86`), that project is skipped, so its compile/test regressions won't be caught in those configurations.

### Outcome

FIX — added Debug|x64, Debug|x86, Release|x64, Release|x86 `ActiveCfg`/`Build.0` entries for `{40534D09-...}`, all mapping to `Any CPU` (matching the other .NET projects in the solution).

### Reply (verbatim)

> Fixed. x64 + x86 Debug/Release mappings added for FactoryDemo.Api.FSharp `{40534D09-...}`, routing to `Any CPU` like the other .NET projects. Resolves this thread and its sibling at Zeta.sln:38.

## Thread 9 — `Zeta.sln:27` — ServiceTitanCrm sln entry

- Reviewer: `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`
- Thread ID: `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59d_fF`
- Severity: P1

### Original comment (verbatim)

> This solution entry adds a company-specific sample project ("ServiceTitanCrm"). Per repo convention, sample projects should stay generic; after renaming the sample project/directory, update the `.sln` project name/path accordingly.

### Outcome

FIX — sln entry renamed to `CrmSample` with `samples\CrmSample\CrmSample.fsproj` path. Matches Thread 6 batch.

### Reply (verbatim)

> Fixed. Sln entry is now `Project("...") = "CrmSample", "samples\CrmSample\CrmSample.fsproj", ...`. Part of the Thread 6 rename batch.

## Thread 10 — `.claude/commands/btw.md:10` — name attribution

- Reviewer: `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`
- Thread ID: `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59d_fn`
- Severity: P1

### Original comment (verbatim)

> This command doc includes direct maintainer name attribution ("(Aaron)"). `docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md` has an operational rule to avoid contributor names in code/docs/skills (use role refs like "human maintainer" instead); please replace this with a role reference.

### Outcome

FIX — same rewrite batch as Thread 4; `(Aaron)` in the intro prose removed, verbatim quotes preserved.

### Reply (verbatim)

> Fixed. Same rewrite batch as Thread 4 — `(Aaron)` removed from narrative prose; verbatim quotes preserved. `btw.md` now uses `human maintainer` / `the maintainer` throughout.

## Thread 11 — `docs/force-multiplication-log.md:6` — name attribution (structural conflict)

- Reviewer: `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`
- Thread ID: `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59d_gA`
- Severity: P1

### Original comment (verbatim)

> This doc uses direct contributor-name attribution (e.g., "Origin: Aaron" and the leaderboard row). `docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md`'s operational standing rule says names should appear only in `memory/persona/**` (and optionally `docs/BACKLOG.md`); please switch narrative prose to role references (e.g., "human maintainer") or move name-bearing tracking to an allowed carve-out file.

### Outcome

DEFER+RESOLVE — structural conflict: the doc's explicit design (`NOT anonymous. Maintainer name is the leaderboard key.`) is incompatible with the no-name rule. Resolving under the comms-hygiene-sweep BACKLOG row so the design conflict gets a proper decision (either reshape the leaderboard around role-keyed aggregation, or add this file to the `memory/persona/**`-style carve-out).

### Reply (verbatim)

> Deferring to `docs/BACKLOG.md` "Comms-hygiene sweep: strip name attribution" (line 2398). This doc is structurally name-keyed (`NOT anonymous. Maintainer name is the leaderboard key`) — the sweep needs to choose between (a) reshape to role-keyed aggregation, (b) add the file to the carve-out list, or (c) split the leaderboard out to a `memory/persona/` home. Outside Stream A+C scope.

## Thread 12 — `memory/MEMORY.md` — name attribution in index entry

- Reviewer: `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`
- Thread ID: `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59d_gV`
- Severity: P1

### Original comment (verbatim)

> This index entry includes direct maintainer name attribution in narrative prose (multiple "Aaron …" phrases). `docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md`'s operational rule restricts contributor names to `memory/persona/**` (and optionally `docs/BACKLOG.md`); please change these to role references (e.g., "human maintainer") and keep personal names only in the allowed locations.

### Outcome

DEFER+RESOLVE — the MEMORY.md index is a memory-file surface (the rule's scope is `code, docs, or skills`; memory is the earned-across-sessions substrate that historically carries names for anchor fidelity). Scope decision for index files belongs with the comms-hygiene sweep owner.

### Reply (verbatim)

> Deferring to `docs/BACKLOG.md` "Comms-hygiene sweep" (line 2398). `memory/MEMORY.md` is auto-memory-index territory, scope-adjacent to `memory/persona/**`; whether the rule covers index entries is a sweep-owner decision (Samir). Preserving the entry as-authored for now; thread resolved.

## Thread 13 — `samples/ServiceTitanCrm/Program.fs:21` — company-specific prose

- Reviewer: `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`
- Thread ID: `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59d_go`
- Severity: P1

### Original comment (verbatim)

> This sample source file still uses the company-specific name in the module path and in prose comments. After renaming the sample project to a generic demo, please update the module/namespace and rewrite the comment to avoid company-specific branding (keep it CRM-shaped but generic).

### Outcome

FIX — module renamed (Thread 7) and the `ServiceTitan-CRM surface` comment rewritten to `A full production CRM surface` (kept CRM-shaped, removed company name).

### Reply (verbatim)

> Fixed. Module renamed (Thread 7); the ServiceTitan-CRM comment now reads `A full production CRM surface` — CRM-shaped but company-agnostic.

## Thread 14 — `src/Core/SignalQuality.fs:8` — unused open

- Reviewer: `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`
- Thread ID: `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59d_gz`
- Severity: P0

### Original comment (verbatim)

> P0: `open System.Runtime.CompilerServices` appears unused in this file. With warnings treated as errors, an unused `open` can break the build; please remove it (and any other unused `open`s) or use it explicitly.

### Outcome

FIX — removed the unused `open System.Runtime.CompilerServices`. Also removed a duplicate `<Compile Include="Algebra/SignalQuality.Tests.fs" />` entry in `Tests.FSharp.fsproj` that was blocking the build.

### Reply (verbatim)

> Fixed. `open System.Runtime.CompilerServices` removed; also cleaned up a duplicate `<Compile>` entry in `Tests.FSharp.fsproj` caught during the build verification. `dotnet build Zeta.sln -c Release` → 0W/0E.

## Thread 15 — `Zeta.sln:38` — FactoryDemo missing x64/x86 mappings (Codex, duplicate of 8)

- Reviewer: `chatgpt-codex-connector`
- Thread ID: `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59eICD`
- Severity: P2

### Original comment (verbatim)

> **Add x64/x86 mapping for FactoryDemo.Api.FSharp**
> The new `Debug|x64/x86` and `Release|x64/x86` solution platforms are introduced, but `ProjectConfigurationPlatforms` still has only `Any CPU` entries for `{40534D09-439E-4E5F-9A69-A73844DB674D}`. In Visual Studio or MSBuild runs that select `Platform=x64`/`x86`, that project is left unmapped and can be skipped from build validation, so config-specific breakages in `samples/FactoryDemo.Api.FSharp` won't be caught.

### Outcome

FIX — same fix as Thread 8 (Codex flagged it twice). Four new platform mappings added for `{40534D09-...}` routing to `Any CPU`.

### Reply (verbatim)

> Fixed via Thread 8 (same issue, duplicate). x64 + x86 Debug/Release mappings are now in place for FactoryDemo.Api.FSharp.
