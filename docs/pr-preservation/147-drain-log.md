### Thread PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59eE_k
- **Reviewer**: copilot-pull-request-reviewer
- **File**: `.claude/commands/btw.md`:10
- **Original comment**: P1: This command doc uses the human maintainer’s name directly (e.g., “(Aaron)”), but the repo’s operational standing rule is “No name attribution in code, docs, or skills” — use role references instead (docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md:284-292). Please rewrite to “human maintainer” (and apply the same sweep to other new docs/skills in this PR that use the name).
- **Outcome**: fix-inline
- **Your reply**: Fixed — swept every name reference in `.claude/commands/btw.md` to "human maintainer" / "the maintainer". Checked the rest of the PR: only `btw.md` is a new doc/skill in this PR with name attribution; other new docs (`samples/FactoryDemo.Api.CSharp/**`, `tools/audit/live-lock-audit.sh`) already use role-refs. Fix in the drain commit.
- **Resolution commit**: drain commit on `feat/servicetitan-factory-demo-api-csharp`

### Thread PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59eFAE
- **Reviewer**: copilot-pull-request-reviewer
- **File**: `tools/audit/live-lock-audit.sh`:54
- **Original comment**: P2: `git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r` does not report paths for the repository’s root commit unless `--root` is provided. If the window includes the root commit (small repos / large windows), it will be misclassified as having no files. Consider adding `--root` to make classification correct for all commits.
- **Outcome**: fix-inline
- **Your reply**: Fixed — added `--root` to the `git diff-tree` invocation and expanded the comment to explain why. Otherwise the root commit silently misclassifies to OTHR (no files). Thanks.
- **Resolution commit**: drain commit on `feat/servicetitan-factory-demo-api-csharp`

### Thread PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59eFAU
- **Reviewer**: copilot-pull-request-reviewer
- **File**: `samples/FactoryDemo.Api.CSharp/Program.cs`:21
- **Original comment**: P1: Root endpoint parity issue — the F# sibling includes "/" in its advertised `endpoints` list, but this C# list omits it. That makes `/` JSON differ between implementations, contradicting the parity guarantee. Consider adding "/" to this list (and updating the smoke-test expected length accordingly), or removing it from the F# sibling so both match.
- **Outcome**: fix-inline
- **Your reply**: Fixed — added `"/"` at the head of the C# endpoints list (9 entries, matching F#'s list order), bumped `smoke-test.sh` expected length from 8 to 9, and updated the script header comment from "all 8 API endpoints plus the root `/`" to "all 9 endpoints". Parity restored.
- **Resolution commit**: drain commit on `feat/servicetitan-factory-demo-api-csharp`

### Thread PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59eFAn
- **Reviewer**: copilot-pull-request-reviewer
- **File**: `samples/FactoryDemo.Api.CSharp/smoke-test.sh`:38
- **Original comment**: P2: The comment claims `mktemp` "works on hosts without a writable /tmp", but `mktemp -t ...` still requires a writable temp directory (typically `$TMPDIR` or `/tmp`). Suggest rewording to avoid implying it works without any writable temp dir (or explicitly mention it uses the system temp dir).
- **Outcome**: fix-inline
- **Your reply**: Fixed — reworded the comment to "writes into the host's system temp dir (honouring `$TMPDIR` when set, falling back to `/tmp`)" so the behaviour is accurately described without the misleading "without a writable /tmp" phrasing.
- **Resolution commit**: drain commit on `feat/servicetitan-factory-demo-api-csharp`

### Thread PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59eFA2
- **Reviewer**: copilot-pull-request-reviewer
- **File**: `samples/ServiceTitanCrm/ServiceTitanCrm.fsproj`:5
- **Original comment**: P1: Repo convention is that demos stay company-neutral (no `samples/ServiceTitan*/` dirs / namespaces). This project name and RootNamespace are ServiceTitan-specific, which the repo feedback explicitly calls out to avoid. Please rename this sample to a generic `FactoryDemo.*`-style name (folder, project, RootNamespace) per `memory/feedback_open_source_repo_demos_stay_generic_not_company_specific_2026_04_23.md:59-66`.
- **Outcome**: fix-inline
- **Your reply**: Fixed — renamed `samples/ServiceTitanCrm/` → `samples/FactoryDemo.Crm/`, `ServiceTitanCrm.fsproj` → `FactoryDemo.Crm.fsproj`, module `Zeta.Samples.ServiceTitanCrm.Program` → `Zeta.Samples.FactoryDemo.Crm.Program`, `RootNamespace` → `Zeta.Samples.FactoryDemo.Crm`. Updated `Zeta.sln` project entry, the ServiceTitan-CRM comment in `Program.fs`, and the `tests/Tests.FSharp/Operators/CrmScenarios.Tests.fs` doc comment. Also removed stray `samples/ServiceTitanFactoryApi/` bin+obj residue left over from an earlier rename.

### Thread PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59eFR4
- **Reviewer**: chatgpt-codex-connector
- **File**: `src/Core/SignalQuality.fs`:175
- **Original comment**: P1: Avoid quarantining short text due gzip header overhead. `compressionRatio` clamps any ratio above `1.0` to `1.0`, and `compressionMeasure` maps that directly to severity, so short non-empty inputs (where gzip header/trailer overhead exceeds raw length) are deterministically scored as maximally suspicious. In practice this means many legitimate short payloads get `Quarantine`, which skews composite quality scoring and can trigger false failures even when content is fine.
- **Outcome**: fix-inline
- **Your reply**: Fixed — added a named `compressionMinInputBytes = 64` threshold. Inputs shorter than 64 bytes short-circuit to `0.0` (neutral Pass) in both `compressionRatio` and `compressionMeasure`, with explicit evidence noting the gzip-header-dominates regime. Rationale inline at the constant's docstring (gzip header 10 B + trailer 8 B + deflate overhead; 64 B leaves enough payload that honest incompressible data can still score high). Existing tests remain valid — the 26-char clamp test asserts `0.0 ≤ ratio ≤ 1.0` which `0.0` satisfies, and the end-to-end structured-vs-fluff test uses inputs well above threshold.

### Thread PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59eFR8
- **Reviewer**: chatgpt-codex-connector
- **File**: `samples/FactoryDemo.Api.CSharp/Program.cs`:24
- **Original comment**: P2: Include root path in C# endpoint index for parity. The C# root metadata omits `"/"` from `endpoints`, while the F# sibling publishes it, so the advertised contract is no longer parity-compatible across the two sample APIs. Any consumer using root endpoint discovery (or parity checks) will see different endpoint sets despite the sample claiming interchangeable behavior.
- **Outcome**: fix-inline (same fix as PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59eFAU above)
- **Your reply**: Fixed — added `"/"` to the C# endpoints list (same fix as Copilot's P1 on the same file). C# list is now 9 entries in F#-matching order; smoke-test length expectation updated from 8 → 9. Parity restored.
- **Resolution commit**: drain commit on `feat/servicetitan-factory-demo-api-csharp`

All 7 threads (first pass): fix-inline. No BACKLOG rows owed.

## 2026-04-24 — second pass (7 NEW post-merge threads)

After the first-pass merge brought in 4 merge commits from
`origin/main`, Copilot + Codex re-ran and surfaced 7 new threads.
Draining them here with the same per-thread audit-trail shape.

### Thread PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59erUL
- **Reviewer**: copilot-pull-request-reviewer
- **File**: `docs/operator-input-quality-log.md`:7
- **Original comment**: P1: This new doc repeatedly uses the contributor name "Aaron" in narrative text. Repo rule is "No name attribution in code, docs, or skills"—names should appear only under memory/persona/<name>/ and optionally docs/BACKLOG.md. Please rewrite to role refs like "human maintainer" / "human operator" (docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md:284-292).
- **Outcome**: scope-bleed — file is NOT in PR #147 diff (landed via commit 204bbb6 on main before this PR's branch point).
- **Your reply**: Scope-bleed — `docs/operator-input-quality-log.md` is not in this PR's diff (landed via 204bbb6 on main). The name-attribution sweep is a main-line concern; tracking under `docs/FACTORY-HYGIENE.md` / BACKLOG "name-attribution sweep" rather than this PR. Resolving as out-of-PR-scope; the sweep will catch it.
- **Resolution commit**: second-pass drain commit on `feat/servicetitan-factory-demo-api-csharp`

### Thread PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59erUu
- **Reviewer**: copilot-pull-request-reviewer
- **File**: `samples/FactoryDemo.Api.CSharp/Seed.cs`:36
- **Original comment**: P2: Seed data includes a person name that looks like it could be the maintainer ("Aaron Smith"). Given the repo's "no name attribution in code/docs/skills" discipline, it's safer to use a clearly fictional/company-neutral placeholder name here to avoid accidental attribution confusion.
- **Outcome**: fix-inline
- **Your reply**: Fixed — renamed row 13 seed entry from `"Aaron Smith (new contact)"` to `"Acme Contact (new lead)"` in both `samples/FactoryDemo.Api.CSharp/Seed.cs:34` and the F# sibling `samples/FactoryDemo.Api.FSharp/Seed.fs:63`, and updated the adjacent email-collision comment. Both siblings stay in parity and use a clearly fictional / company-neutral placeholder.
- **Resolution commit**: second-pass drain commit on `feat/servicetitan-factory-demo-api-csharp`

### Thread PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59erVH
- **Reviewer**: copilot-pull-request-reviewer
- **File**: `drop/README.md`:12
- **Original comment**: The doc says this README is the only tracked file in `drop/`, but this PR also tracks `drop/.gitignore`. Please correct the wording so it matches the actual tracked sentinel design (README.md + .gitignore).
- **Outcome**: fix-inline
- **Your reply**: Fixed — reworded to "Together with the sibling `drop/.gitignore` it is one of the two tracked sentinel files in `drop/` — the README explains the shape and the `.gitignore` implements it (gitignore-except-sentinel)." Matches the actual tracked state (`README.md` + `.gitignore`).
- **Resolution commit**: second-pass drain commit on `feat/servicetitan-factory-demo-api-csharp`

### Thread PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59erVa
- **Reviewer**: copilot-pull-request-reviewer
- **File**: `tools/audit/live-lock-audit.sh`:11
- **Original comment**: P1: This script comment attributes the directive to a specific contributor name ("Aaron's …"). Repo operational rule is "No name attribution in code, docs, or skills"—use role references like "human maintainer" instead (docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md:284-292).
- **Outcome**: fix-inline
- **Your reply**: Fixed — rewrote the docstring attribution from `"Aaron's 2026-04-23 directive"` to `"Human-maintainer 2026-04-23 directive"`. Role ref per the rule.
- **Resolution commit**: second-pass drain commit on `feat/servicetitan-factory-demo-api-csharp`

### Thread PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59erVr
- **Reviewer**: copilot-pull-request-reviewer
- **File**: `docs/AUTONOMOUS-LOOP.md`:None
- **Original comment**: P1: This doc uses the contributor name "Aaron" in guidance text (e.g., "flag to Aaron"). Repo rule is to avoid contributor names in docs; use a role reference ("human maintainer") instead (docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md:284-292).
- **Outcome**: already-addressed + scope-bleed. `docs/AUTONOMOUS-LOOP.md` is NOT in this PR's diff, and a repo-wide grep on HEAD shows zero `Aaron` occurrences in that file — the "flag to the human maintainer" line already uses the role reference (line 204-205). Copilot appears to be reviewing against stale context.
- **Your reply**: Already-addressed + scope-bleed. `docs/AUTONOMOUS-LOOP.md` is not in this PR's diff, and `grep -i aaron docs/AUTONOMOUS-LOOP.md` on HEAD returns zero matches — the "flag to the human maintainer" phrasing is already a role reference (line 204-205). Copilot flagged stale context. Resolving.
- **Resolution commit**: second-pass drain commit on `feat/servicetitan-factory-demo-api-csharp`

### Thread PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59er9T
- **Reviewer**: chatgpt-codex-connector
- **File**: `tools/audit/live-lock-audit.sh`:63
- **Original comment**: P1: Handle merge commits when collecting changed paths. The classifier uses `git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r --root "$sha"`, which yields no file list for merge commits unless merge mode is requested. `git diff-tree -h` explicitly exposes merge-specific modes (`-m`, `-c`, `--cc`); in this repo `df1f2f1` returns 0 paths without `-m` but returns changed files with `-m`. Merge commits are currently mis-bucketed as `OTHR`, skewing EXT/INTL/SPEC percentages and potentially triggering or suppressing the live-lock smell incorrectly.
- **Outcome**: fix-inline
- **Your reply**: Fixed — added `-m` to the `git diff-tree` invocation and pipe through `sort -u` to fold duplicate paths across parents. Expanded the comment to explain the merge-commit pitfall (zero paths → mis-bucket as OTHR → skewed EXT/INTL/SPEC ratios → the live-lock gate can fire or suppress incorrectly). Re-ran `tools/audit/live-lock-audit.sh 10` against the current window and merges like `f1dc2bb` now bucket on their real paths. Thanks.
- **Resolution commit**: second-pass drain commit on `feat/servicetitan-factory-demo-api-csharp`

### Thread PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM59er9W
- **Reviewer**: chatgpt-codex-connector
- **File**: `tests/Tests.FSharp/Algebra/SignalQuality.Tests.fs`:1
- **Original comment**: P2: Include new SignalQuality/CRM tests in the test project. This new test file is not actually executed because `tests/Tests.FSharp/Tests.FSharp.fsproj` uses an explicit `<Compile Include=...>` list and does not include `Algebra/SignalQuality.Tests.fs` (or `Operators/CrmScenarios.Tests.fs`).
- **Outcome**: already-addressed — both files ARE listed in `tests/Tests.FSharp/Tests.FSharp.fsproj` (line 26: `Algebra/SignalQuality.Tests.fs`; line 49: `Operators/CrmScenarios.Tests.fs`). `dotnet build -c Release` on current HEAD produces `Tests.FSharp.dll` with these test classes in it. Codex flagged stale context (likely the first iteration of the branch before the `<Compile Include=...>` rows were added).
- **Your reply**: Already-addressed — both test files are in `tests/Tests.FSharp/Tests.FSharp.fsproj` (line 26 for `Algebra/SignalQuality.Tests.fs`, line 49 for `Operators/CrmScenarios.Tests.fs`). Build produces `Tests.FSharp.dll` with those test classes; CI enforces them. Codex appears to have flagged an earlier branch state. Resolving.
- **Resolution commit**: second-pass drain commit on `feat/servicetitan-factory-demo-api-csharp`

---

Second-pass summary:
- 4 fix-inline (Seed.cs + Seed.fs name, drop/README wording, live-lock-audit.sh attribution, live-lock-audit.sh `-m` flag).
- 3 scope-bleed / already-addressed (operator-input-quality-log out-of-PR, AUTONOMOUS-LOOP out-of-PR with zero Aaron on HEAD, SignalQuality/CRM tests already in fsproj).

Build: `dotnet build -c Release` — 0W/0E.
Audit sanity: `tools/audit/live-lock-audit.sh 10` — still healthy with merge-commits now bucketed correctly.
