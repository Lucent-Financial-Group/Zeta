### Original comment

> P1: Ensure docs/claims exists before TL;DR claim commands
>
> The quick-start starts with `ls docs/claims/` and then asks contributors to add `docs/claims/<slug>.md`, but this commit does not create or track a `docs/claims/` directory anywhere, so the documented flow fails on a fresh clone (`ls` errors and claim-file creation cannot follow the listed commands). Add an explicit `mkdir -p docs/claims` step (or a tracked placeholder file) before these commands so first-time claimers can execute the protocol as writ

### Reply

> Fixed in 541e7b7. `docs/claims/README.md` now ships tracked as the non-empty placeholder so `ls docs/claims/` resolves on a fresh clone. Step 2 of the TL;DR was also reworded to note the directory is tracked and to fall back to `mkdir -p docs/claims` only if it is somehow missing.

### Original comment

> P2: Reconcile git-native claim instructions in workflow doc
>
> This table switches git-native claiming to `docs/claims/<slug>.md`, but earlier in the same file the git-native adapter section still instructs claim signaling via BACKLOG row status-marker commits and `git log docs/BACKLOG.md`; that contradiction will cause parallel agents to use different locking mechanisms and miss each other's claims. Update the earlier git-native section to match the new claim-file protocol so the workflow remains internally co

### Reply

> Fixed in 541e7b7. The earlier "(3) Git-native only" section now points at `AGENT-CLAIM-PROTOCOL.md` as the authoritative claim-file substrate. Backlog-row markers are reframed as row-local annotations, not the locking mechanism. The mechanism table and the prose section now agree.

## Thread 3 — `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58syNY`

- **Reviewer:** chatgpt-codex-connector
- **File:line:** `docs/AGENT-ISSUE-WORKFLOW.md:90`
- **Outcome:** FIX
- **Resolution commit:** `541e7b7`

### Original comment

> P1: The updated git-native claim mechanism now depends on `docs/claims/<slug>.md`, but earlier in this doc's "Git-native only" section it still describes claims as row-marker commits in `docs/BACKLOG.md`. That leaves the document internally inconsistent about what "git-native" means. Update the earlier git-native-only description to match the new claim-file protocol (or explicitly differentiate backlog row markers from claim files).

### Reply

> Fixed in 541e7b7 (same edit as thread `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58swbF`). The "(3) Git-native only" section now points at `AGENT-CLAIM-PROTOCOL.md` and explicitly differentiates backlog-row markers (row-local annotations) from claim files (the lock).

## Thread 4 — `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58syN6`

- **Reviewer:** chatgpt-codex-connector
- **File:line:** `docs/AGENT-ISSUE-WORKFLOW.md:96`
- **Outcome:** FIX
- **Resolution commit:** `541e7b7`

### Original comment

> P1: The table suggests `ls docs/claims/`, but `docs/claims/` doesn't exist in the repo today, so this lookup command will fail for new clones unless the directory is added/tracked or the docs instruct creating it first. Also, commit message examples here use an em dash (`—`) while `AGENT-CLAIM-PROTOCOL.md` uses a hyphen (`-`); standardising punctuation would make the convention easier to follow and grep.

### Reply

> Fixed in 541e7b7. Both halves: `docs/claims/README.md` now ships tracked (so `ls docs/claims/` resolves on fresh clones); the table's `claim:` / `release:` examples switched from em-dash to ASCII hyphen to match the canonical pattern in `AGENT-CLAIM-PROTOCOL.md`. The table cell now also notes the directory is tracked with a `README.md` placeholder.

## Thread 5 — `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58syOH`

- **Reviewer:** chatgpt-codex-connector
- **File:line:** `docs/AGENT-CLAIM-PROTOCOL.md` (line null)
- **Outcome:** BACKLOG+RESOLVE (already-fixed)
- **Resolution commit:** `e5b9d14` (prior commit on this branch, pre-rebase)

### Original comment

> P1: The internal link target for the TL;DR section looks incorrect. GitHub's anchor for the heading `## TL;DR — five steps` will be based on `tldr` (not `tl-dr`), so `[TL;DR](#tl-dr-five-steps)` likely resolves to a non-existent anchor. Update the link to the actual generated anchor, or add an explicit anchor ID matching `tl-dr-five-steps` to keep the short link stable.

### Reply

> Already addressed in commit e5b9d14 ("docs/AGENT-CLAIM-PROTOCOL.md: fix markdownlint MD051 on TL;DR anchor") earlier on this branch. The current state shows `[TL;DR: five steps](#tldr-five-steps)` linking to `## TL;DR: five steps` — GitHub's anchor generator strips the colon and the link resolves correctly. This thread predates the fix; resolving as already-fixed.

## Thread 6 — `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58syOT`

- **Reviewer:** chatgpt-codex-connector
- **File:line:** `docs/AGENT-CLAIM-PROTOCOL.md:61`
- **Outcome:** FIX
- **Resolution commit:** `541e7b7`

### Original comment

> P1: The TL;DR commands assume `docs/claims/` already exists, but the repository currently has no `docs/claims/` directory. As written, `ls docs/claims/` will fail on a fresh clone. Either add a tracked `docs/claims/` directory (e.g., with a short README / placeholder file) or adjust the instructions to create it (`mkdir -p docs/claims`) before listing/catting claim files.

### Reply

> Fixed in 541e7b7. Same fix as thread `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58swbC`: `docs/claims/README.md` ships tracked, plus the TL;DR step 2 prose explicitly mentions both that the directory is tracked and the `mkdir -p docs/claims` fallback if it is somehow missing.

## Thread 7 — `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58syOc`

- **Reviewer:** chatgpt-codex-connector
- **File:line:** `docs/AGENT-CLAIM-PROTOCOL.md:215`
- **Outcome:** FIX
- **Resolution commit:** `541e7b7`

### Original comment

> P1: The claim template asks for `Session: <agent-identity or human-handle>`, which will put contributor/agent names into `docs/claims/<slug>.md` and therefore into permanent git history. This conflicts with `docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md` ("No name attribution in code, docs, or skills"). Consider switching the template to an opaque session ID (plus harness type) and making any contact handle optional/out-of-band.

### Reply

> Fixed in 541e7b7. Template field renamed `Session` → `Session ID` with the explicit instruction "opaque session ID; do not use direct agent or human handles." The "Session identity" section was reworked to drop `<username>` from every suggested format (now just `<harness>/<short-date-hash>`) and to route contact handles out-of-band through the platform mirror or the PR thread. A new paragraph cites `docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md` and explains why claim files (which become permanent git history) are inside the no-name-attribution scope.

## Thread 8 — `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58syOp`

- **Reviewer:** chatgpt-codex-connector
- **File:line:** `docs/AGENT-CLAIM-PROTOCOL.md:194`
- **Outcome:** FIX
- **Resolution commit:** `541e7b7`

### Original comment

> P1: This paragraph introduces a direct contributor name ("Amara"), which conflicts with the repo rule to avoid direct contributor/agent names in code/docs/skills (see `docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md` operational rule "No name attribution in code, docs, or skills"). Rephrase to describe the observed pattern generically (e.g., "a Deep Research archive report" / "an architectural review") without naming individuals.

### Reply

> Fixed in 541e7b7. The Report-back / write-via-maintainer paragraph now reads "external-AI Deep Research archive reports and external-AI architectural reviews" — role refs only, no direct contributor or agent names. Composes with thread `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58uoJH` which flagged the same passage.

## Thread 9 — `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58syOz`

- **Reviewer:** chatgpt-codex-connector
- **File:line:** `docs/AGENT-CLAIM-PROTOCOL.md:402`
- **Outcome:** FIX
- **Resolution commit:** `541e7b7`

### Original comment

> P1: This section claims `memory/persona/` and `memory/` are "not in the git tree" and therefore cannot be modified. In this repo, `memory/` is tracked (e.g., `memory/MEMORY.md` exists), so this is factually incorrect and will confuse external agents. If the intent is "do not modify memory entries," state it as a policy/permission boundary rather than a git-visibility claim.

### Reply

> Fixed in 541e7b7. Reframed as a permission boundary, not a git-visibility claim: the doc now acknowledges `memory/` is tracked (citing `memory/MEMORY.md` and `memory/persona/README.md` as the canonical map), and states the rule as "external claim-holders do not modify the persona layer unless your hand-off explicitly scoped you to a memory file." Factually correct and the no-touch rule is preserved.

## Thread 10 — `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58umGB`

- **Reviewer:** Copilot
- **File:line:** `docs/AGENT-CLAIM-PROTOCOL.md:139`
- **Outcome:** FIX
- **Resolution commit:** `541e7b7`

### Original comment

> P1: Publish claim before doing work on PR branches
>
> In Codex/sandbox mode this says a single PR should contain `claim + work + release`, which keeps the claim file only on a feature branch until merge. Parallel agents following the documented lookup (`ls docs/claims/` / `git log --grep="^claim:"`) against `main` will not see that active claim, so two agents can independently claim the same slug and duplicate the task. This breaks the lock protocol in the common PR workflow unless claims are first published to

### Reply

> Fixed in 541e7b7. Codex/sandbox mode section now leads with "Push the claim commit early" — the `claim:` commit lands on a pushed branch (no PR required) so other agents can see it via `git ls-remote origin claim/<slug>` before the work starts. A trailing paragraph addresses the case where the sandbox cannot push at all: that case is the report-back / write-via-maintainer mode, which the doc now requires the agent to declare explicitly so other agents know the claim won't appear on `main` until the maintainer commits the artifact.

- **Reviewer:** chatgpt-codex-connector
- **File:line:** `docs/AGENT-CLAIM-PROTOCOL.md:40`
- **Outcome:** FIX
- **Resolution commit:** `541e7b7`

### Original comment

> The hand-off template always instructs the agent to open a PR and release the claim, but this conflicts with the later "Deep Research" and "Report-back / write-via-maintainer" modes where the substrate may be read-only/no-push. Adjust the template so it branches: "If you can push/open a PR, do so; otherwise use report-back mode and return an artifact for the maintainer to commit."

### Reply

> Fixed in 541e7b7. Step 5 of the hand-off template now branches: open a PR if you can push, otherwise use the report-back / write-via-maintainer mode and return the artifact for the maintainer to commit. Step 3's mode list also added `report-back` as a fourth option so the hand-off briefing names all four substrate-shape modes.

## Thread 12 — `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58uoJH`

- **Reviewer:** chatgpt-codex-connector
- **File:line:** `docs/AGENT-CLAIM-PROTOCOL.md:198`
- **Outcome:** FIX (composes with thread 8)
- **Resolution commit:** `541e7b7`

### Original comment

> This section introduces a personal name ("Amara") in a doc. Repo convention is to avoid direct contributor/agent names in docs (use role references instead; names are limited to memory/persona/** and a few carve-outs like docs/HUMAN-BACKLOG.md). Please rewrite this example to be name-free (e.g., "a ChatGPT Deep Research archive report").

### Reply

> Fixed in 541e7b7 (same edit as thread `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58syOp`). The paragraph now reads "external-AI Deep Research archive reports and external-AI architectural reviews" — role refs only, no direct contributor or agent names.

## Thread 13 — `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58uoJo`

- **Reviewer:** chatgpt-codex-connector
- **File:line:** `docs/AGENT-ISSUE-WORKFLOW.md:96`
- **Outcome:** FIX (composes with thread 4)
- **Resolution commit:** `541e7b7`

### Original comment

> The commit message examples in this row use an em dash (`—`) but `docs/AGENT-CLAIM-PROTOCOL.md` specifies the canonical pattern as `verb: <slug> - <detail>`. Please pick one delimiter and apply consistently (preferably the ASCII `-` to avoid copy/paste and tooling surprises).

### Reply

> Fixed in 541e7b7 (same edit as thread `PRRT_kwDOSF9kNM58syN6`). The table's `claim: <slug> - <scope>` and `release: <slug> - landed in <SHA>` examples now use ASCII hyphen, matching the canonical pattern in `AGENT-CLAIM-PROTOCOL.md`.

The drain commit `541e7b7` lands on top of those three.

## Final state

- Unresolved threads: 0 (target)
- mergeable: MERGEABLE (target after the force-push triggers GitHub recompute)
- Auto-merge armed: pre-existing
- Pushed SHAs: `541e7b7` (drain commit) on top of the three rebased PR commits
