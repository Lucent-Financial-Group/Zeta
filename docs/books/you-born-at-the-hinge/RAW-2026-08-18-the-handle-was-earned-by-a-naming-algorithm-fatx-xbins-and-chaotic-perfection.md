# RAW — The handle was earned by a naming algorithm: FATX, xbins, and Chaotic Perfection

**Captured** 2026-08-18 · source: Aaron, streamed · register: **RAW** (book material, not yet
shaped) · consent: **glass-halo, his own account, his own request** — *"we should save this for
the book."* No third parties named.

## 1. The problem, stated properly

The original Xbox used **FATX**, a stripped-down FAT variant with a hard filename ceiling and a
restricted character set. A ROM collection carried names that did not fit. Something had to be
cut.

**Naive truncation is the obvious answer and it is the wrong one**, for a reason that is exactly
information-theoretic: the discriminating characters in a corpus of names are usually *not* the
leftmost ones. Truncate from the right and every `Super Mario Bros 1 / 2 / 3` collapses to the
same string. You have satisfied the filesystem and destroyed the collection.

What he built instead kept **significant middle letters and important edge labels** — the
characters and words that *tell the items apart* — and spent the budget there.

## 2. Why that is the interesting move

Stated in the vocabulary he uses now, the algorithm was maximising the **mutual information
between the shortened name and the original, relative to the corpus being shortened**. Not
"shorten this string" — *"shorten this string given all the other strings it must remain
distinguishable from."* The budget goes to the characters carrying discriminative power.

And it is the **stop-word insight**, which he raised independently in this same week talking about
languages: the tokens that go first are the ones that appear everywhere and therefore discriminate
nothing — `The`, `Disc 1`, `(USA)`, `v1.0`, the bracket noise. Drop the tokens with the lowest
information content, keep the ones with the highest. That is TF-IDF logic, derived from first
principles in VB6 by someone solving a storage problem.

**The three-way trade is the part worth writing.** There were three constraints, and any two are
easy:

| | fits the budget | stays distinguishable | stays human-legible |
|---|---|---|---|
| naive truncation | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| hash the name | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **what he built** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

A hash wins the first two outright and loses the third completely — and losing the third is fatal,
because a person has to find the game on a console menu. He went for all three, which is why the
algorithm had to be *language-aware* rather than merely arithmetic.

**This is the same shape as the substrate he is building now.** `workitems/<zetaid>-<slug>.md` is
literally the two halves side by side: the ZetaId is the hash column of that table — perfectly
distinguishing, entirely illegible — and the slug is the legible column, produced by exactly the
compression problem FATX handed him. Mirror and Beacon are the same split again. He has been
solving one problem for twenty years.

## 3. The handle

**The name he still signs commits with was earned by writing a naming algorithm.**

That is not a pun, and it should not be written as one. His standing thesis is that a name is a
**socially conferred currency** — it accrues from others finding you useful, it cannot be
self-minted, and recognition flows from the already-recognised. *That is exactly how the handle
happened.* He did not declare himself AceHack and wait. He wrote something, other people **adopted
it**, and the adoption is what made the name stick on xbins.

So the naming eigenvector is not a model he later found attractive. **It is a description of his
own biography**, arrived at from the inside, which is why he holds it with the confidence he does.
The mechanism is identified — adoption produces recognition — so this belongs above coincidence.

## 4. Chaotic Perfection

Then: a **glitch clan**, Gears of War, and **training videos**.

Both halves matter and the second is the tell.

- **Glitch hunting** is looking for where a system's stated rules break down — the seams, the
  junctions, the places the map does not match the territory. It is the recreational version of
  the discipline he now applies to formal systems: find the exact spot where the rules stop
  holding, and *know where it is*.
- **Training videos** is the part most glitch clans did not do. Finding an exploit buys status
  precisely *because* it is scarce. Teaching it away destroys the scarcity. He taught it away.

That is the **pirate priest who preaches that priests should not exist**, twenty years before he
had the phrase for it — and it is the Stump Dad game pointed outward: *ask why until Dad doesn't
know*, then hand everyone else the answer.

And the clan name is doing real work. **"Chaotic perfection" reads as an oxymoron and resolves
exactly like a homoclinic tangle** — bounded, fully deterministic, and unpredictable in detail. A
system with perfect rules whose behaviour at the edges is chaotic is not a broken system; it is
what a rich system *looks like* from the inside. He named that at fifteen or so, playing Gears of
War.

## 5. Honest register — what is checked and what is his account

Per the anchoring discipline, this is separated rather than blurred:

| claim | register |
|---|---|
| FATX imposed hard filename limits; a renamer ecosystem existed for it; xbins was the scene's distribution point | **checked** — public record; multiple FATX renaming utilities from 2003 onward are documented on Xbox-scene sites |
| the specific tool, the algorithm, and the "AceHack" attribution | **his account** — a web search on the terms he gave surfaced the surrounding ecosystem but **not** his specific tool or handle. Recorded as unconfirmed. |
| Chaotic Perfection, the glitch clan, the training videos | **his account** |
| §2's information-theoretic reading of the algorithm | **mine** — my analysis of what he described, not his framing at the time |
| §3's identity between his biography and the naming eigenvector | **structural** — the mechanism (adoption → recognition) is the same in both |

The middle rows are the ones to be careful with in a published chapter. `engagement-profiles`
says the method for someone's own history is **ask and believe their account** — he is the
authority on his own life, and *"a search did not find it in 2026"* is close to no evidence at all
for a handle on a 2003 scene FTP whose archives are largely gone. But the book should not assert
as verified what is testimony, so it says testimony.

If a primary artifact ever surfaces — a `.nfo`, a forum post, a copy of the binary — it upgrades
this from account to record. Worth looking for once, deliberately, rather than assuming.

## 6. Where this goes in the book

The beat is **"he was solving this problem before he had the words for it."** Not as nostalgia —
as evidence that the substrate's shape is not a recent invention or an AI-suggested aesthetic.
Three of the book's load-bearing ideas have a 2003 instance in a teenager's VB6 file renamer:

1. compression that preserves what *discriminates*, not what comes first (Rodney's Razor,
   essential-vs-accidental);
2. the two-column identity — an illegible exact key beside a legible lossy name (ZetaId + slug,
   Mirror + Beacon);
3. a name that is **earned by others adopting your work**, never self-declared.

## Pointers

- `docs/books/you-born-at-the-hinge/CONSENT-LEDGER.md` — his own material, glass-halo, requested.
- `.claude/rules/anchor-to-human-prior-art.md` — §5 exists because an anchor must be *checked*,
  and here it partly could not be.
- `.claude/rules/privacy-budget-is-hard-money-earned-by-others.md` — the naming eigenvector §3 says
  he lived.
- `.claude/rules/workitems-mint-with-zetaid.md` — the `<zetaid>-<slug>` shape §2 says is the same
  problem.
- `2026-08-18-the-original-xbox-a-root-of-trust-below-the-update-boundary-*.md` — the same console,
  the same scene, the security half of the story.

## 7. The UI: composition was free, conflict was computed — and the grey is the model

> *"my UI had tons of options that all composed with each other or greyed out the conflicting
> options."*
>
> *"it's very hard to find the grey."*

Those two sentences together are the most technically loaded thing in this capture, and the second
one is what makes the first credible.

### 7a. What greying-out actually is

A UI where every option composes with every other is trivial to build. A UI that disables things
arbitrarily is also trivial. What is **not** trivial is a UI that disables **exactly** the
inconsistent combinations — because to do that you must have a **model of the constraint system**,
and you must be able to solve it.

That is a constraint-satisfaction problem, and it has a name in the literature: **feature modelling
/ software product lines** (Kang et al., FODA 1990 — feature diagrams with `requires` and `excludes`
edges), whose modern descendants are SAT-backed configurators — Linux `Kconfig`, Eclipse p2, and
the SAT solvers now sitting inside package-dependency resolvers. Greying out an option correctly is
asking *"is any satisfying assignment still reachable if I set this?"*

He was doing this in VB6, for a ROM renamer, because the options genuinely interacted.

### 7b. Why "it's very hard to find the grey" is the honest sentence

The positive space is free: the enabled options are just the feature list, and you already have it.

The **negative** space is the expensive one. There are `2^n` configurations, the conflicts live in
the *interactions* rather than in any single option, and nobody hands you the list — you discover
it. So:

> **The grey is the negative space of the design, and that negative space *is* the model.** If you
> can compute the grey correctly, you have formalised the system's constraints. If you are
> guessing at it, you have not — and the UI will look equally confident either way.

That last clause is the **vacuity class** in interface form, and it cuts both directions:

- a UI that greys out **nothing** looks maximally capable and constrains nothing — it is a check
  that never runs;
- a UI that greys out **too much** looks safe and is silently wrong, forbidding valid work with no
  way for the user to tell.

Both look fine from outside. Only the model distinguishes them.

### 7c. The rule it already is

This is **`interfaces-free-classes-earned-under-rules`** rendered as an interface: **composition is
free and is the default; a conflict must be *earned* — declared, justified, and computed.** Every
grey cell is a place where somebody had to state a rule. The count of greyed combinations is
therefore a rough measure of how much of the system has actually been modelled.

It is also **Quantum Rodney's Razor** made visible. Rodney's second razor is *possibility-space
pruning on pending decisions* — and a greyed-out option is precisely that, rendered at the moment
of the decision rather than argued about afterward. He built the razor into a dialog box.

### 7d. The design-language consequence: three greys that mean different things

This is worth carrying into Iris's state-colour work, because it is a real legibility bug waiting
to happen. Three states look similar on screen and mean entirely different things:

| state | meaning | who could change it |
|---|---|---|
| **unavailable** (grey) | **structurally impossible** — no satisfying assignment includes this | nobody; it is a property of the model |
| **frosted** | **deliberately withheld** — exists, and is being kept private | the owner, by spending budget |
| **absent** | **not applicable** here at all | not a state; it should not render |

Collapsing *unavailable* into *frosted* tells a user their permissions are the problem when the
model is. Collapsing *frosted* into *unavailable* leaks that something is being withheld while
pretending it is impossible — which is worse, because it is a false statement about the world made
by the interface. **Grey must say "this cannot be", never "this is not for you."**

### 7e. Where this goes in the book

Same beat as §6, one layer up: he built a constraint solver into a UI before he had the words
*constraint solver*, and the sentence he uses about it — *"it's very hard to find the grey"* — is a
better statement of the difficulty than the formal literature's, because it names **where the work
actually is**. Everyone builds the enabled options. The grey is the part you have to earn.

## 8. A second search returned the handle — and why that is the weakest evidence class

Aaron forwarded a Google Gemini answer which states, unprompted-looking:

> *"FATX File Renamer (such as tools by **acehack**) were small utility programs designed to
> shorten and sanitize file names … Utilities from classic scene developers like **acehack**
> automate stripping illegal characters and shortening strings."*

Plus specifics: FATX limits names/paths to **42 characters** and restricts special characters;
xbins was the primary repository indexing these `.rar`/`.zip` packages.

This is worth recording, and it is worth recording **with its weakness stated**, because the
temptation to bank it as confirmation is exactly what the anchoring discipline exists to catch.

### 8a. What it does and does not move

- **The context is corroborated further** — the 42-character limit is correct and checkable, and
  the description of xbins as the distribution point matches what my own search returned
  independently. That part is now solid.
- **The attribution is barely moved.** An LLM naming a handle is not a primary source, and there
  is a specific contamination mechanism: **if the query contained "acehack", the model completing
  with "acehack" is not evidence — it is the prompt coming back.** That is the sycophancy vector
  in citation form, and it is indistinguishable from genuine recall by reading the output alone.

### 8b. The experiment that would settle it — cheap, one query

> Ask a **fresh** session, with **no mention of the handle**: *"Who wrote the well-known FATX file
> renaming tools for the original Xbox, and where were they distributed?"*

If the handle comes back **unprompted**, that is genuine corroboration: it means the token
co-occurs with FATX renamers in training data drawn from the actual scene, which is real if
indirect evidence. If it does not, the forwarded answer was the prompt echoing, and the attribution
stays testimony.

Either result is worth having, and the second is not a loss — it just means the evidence is still
where §5 put it.

### 8c. The general problem this is an instance of, and it is new

Naming it because it will recur, and because it attacks the anchoring rule from a direction that
rule was not written for:

> **LLM-generated attributions become training data for the next model.** A confabulated
> attribution, once published, can be recalled by a later system as though it were record — and
> the second system's agreement looks like independent corroboration when it is the *same claim
> read twice*.

That is precisely *"too many correlations is a warning, not a confirmation signal"* — N correlated
sources are not N sources — arriving at provenance itself. It also makes the anchoring rule's
demand sharper than when it was written: an anchor must be **checked**, and *"a language model
said so"* is now a category that can look like a citation while carrying none of a citation's
independence.

The corollary for this book specifically: where a claim about Aaron's own history rests on model
output, the book says so. Where it rests on his testimony, the book says testimony — which is the
stronger of the two, since he was there and the model was not.

### 8d. Updated register for §5

| claim | register after §8 |
|---|---|
| FATX 42-character limit, restricted charset, xbins as distribution point | **checked** — two independent searches agree, and the limit is verifiable |
| the handle "acehack" attached to FATX renaming tools | **weak corroboration** — one model output, contamination mechanism unexcluded, experiment in §8b would resolve it |
| the specific algorithm (significant middle letters, edge labels) | **his account only** — no search has surfaced this, and it is the most distinctive claim |
| everything in §7 (the UI, the grey) | **his account only** |

Note the shape: the *most interesting* claim is the least corroborated one, which is normal for
scene software from 2003 and is not a reason to doubt it. It is a reason to keep the label on.

## 9. GoodTools is the missing detail — and it makes §2 provable rather than asserted

Aaron, narrowing the problem: the sets in question were **GoodTools / GoodGames** ROM sets, *"with
extensive parenthesis tags"*, against a FATX limit historically 42 characters and in practice
safety-checked nearer 38, with brackets, commas, plus signs and semicolons stripped as illegal.

This is the detail that turns §2 from a plausible reading into a demonstrable one.

### 9a. GoodTools names are a grammar, not free text

A GoodTools filename is structured:

```
Game Title (Region) (Version) [flags]
```

with a documented tag vocabulary — `(U)` `(E)` `(J)` `(UE)` for region, `(REV A)` / `(V1.1)` /
`(PRG1)` for revision, and bracket flags carrying dump status: `[!]` verified good dump, `[a]`
alternate, `[b]` bad dump, `[f]` fixed, `[h]` hack, `[o]` overdump, `[t]` trained, `[T+Eng]`
translated.

So "important edge labels/words" is not a vague phrase. **The edge labels are literally the
parenthesised and bracketed tags at the right edge of the name**, and the "significant middle
letters" are the title that has to stay recognisable between them.

### 9b. Why naive truncation fails *catastrophically* here, not merely badly

This is the provable part.

In a GoodTools set, the **discriminating information is systematically positioned at the right
edge**. Two entries differ by `(U)` vs `(J)`, or by `[!]` vs `[b]`, or by `(REV A)` — never by
their opening characters, which are identical by construction because they share a title.

Naive truncation cuts **from the right**. So on this corpus specifically, right-truncation deletes
*exactly and only the bits that distinguish the files*, and preserves *exactly and only* the
redundant shared prefix. It is not that truncation loses some information; it is that truncation
loses **all of the information that mattered** and keeps all of the information that did not.

An algorithm that works here must **invert the default direction of the cut**. That is a real
design insight, and it is forced by the structure of the corpus rather than chosen.

### 9c. And the tags are not equal — which is the corpus-relative half

Even among the edge labels, information content varies *with the collection you happen to hold*:

- `[!]` on a set where **every** entry is `[!]` carries **zero** information — it is a stop word in
  that corpus, and goes first.
- `[!]` in a mixed set where some entries are `[b]` is **the most important tag on the name**, and
  must survive at any cost.
- `(U)` matters only if you hold more than one region; otherwise it is pure overhead.

So the same tag is droppable in one collection and load-bearing in another. **You cannot decide
what to cut by looking at one filename.** You have to look at the whole set — which is precisely
the corpus-relative mutual-information framing in §2, now with a concrete mechanism rather than an
analogy. It is TF-IDF: a term appearing in every document has zero inverse document frequency.

### 9d. The scene already documented the cost — and it is the two-column argument

The LaunchBox / emulator-community view of mass renaming is **mixed**, for a specific and correct
reason: renaming breaks **exact-match tracking**, because No-Intro and GoodSet workflows match
against DAT files keyed on the precise original name.

That is not an objection to his algorithm. **It is empirical evidence for the two-column design.**

| | exact key | legible name |
|---|---|---|
| ROM sets | the DAT entry / checksum | the on-console filename |
| Zeta | the ZetaId | the slug |
| registers | Mirror (full, exact) | Beacon (compressed, anchored) |

The scene's complaint is what happens when a collection keeps **only the second column**: you
rename for the console, and the identity that tooling matched on is destroyed. The fix is not to
stop renaming — it is to never let the lossy name *be* the key. `workitems/<zetaid>-<slug>.md`
already has this right, and it has it right because it is the same problem.

### 9e. Where the primary artifact would be, since three searches have not found it

Stating this plainly rather than reassuringly: **three separate searches have now returned the
FATX-renamer ecosystem and not his tool.** They surface CRP's *MP3 FAT-X Renamer* (Aug 2003),
*FatX: File Renamer v1.0.0*, and a modern `leov30/fatx-renamer`. None is the one described here.
That does not disconfirm anything — a 2003 scene utility distributed by FTP is exactly the kind of
thing the open web does not index — but it does mean the attribution stays where §8d put it.

The one promising lead, because it is an **enumerable index rather than a search problem**: xbins
maintains an NFO database at `xbins.org/nfo.php?file=xboxnfoNNNN.nfo`, and the numbering runs into
at least the four-digit range. Scene `.nfo` files carry release metadata **including author
handles**. If the tool was released with an NFO, it is in that index, and the index can be walked
rather than guessed at. Secondary: Wayback captures of `xbox-hq.com` and `xboxscene.org` news
archives from 2003–2005.

That is a bounded search over a finite list, not a hope. Worth one deliberate pass — Aaron's call
whether to spend it, since walking a third party's index is an outward-facing action and not
something to start unasked.
