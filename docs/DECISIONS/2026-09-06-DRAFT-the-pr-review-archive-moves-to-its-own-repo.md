# DRAFT — the PR-review archive moves to its own repo

**Status: DRAFT. Nothing has moved, nothing is deleted, and this is not authorised.**
Written on Aaron's 2026-09-06 request — *"draft the archive repo split"* — after the
measurement in `081M1TRJ3X5087G0R0032TNP8H`. The decision is his; this is the shape of it,
with the costs named rather than discovered later.

## Why

Aaron, 2026-09-06: *"we are trying to limit our size increase on zeta and make the growth
happen on other repos, zeta is trying to stay small … if you can make other repos grow
instead that's okay but also we want to reduce size too."*

Measured, 30 days:

| | files / 30d | |
|---|---:|---|
| whole repo | 53,944 | |
| **the two archive trees** | **34,339** | **64%**, ~44.2 MB |

Two-thirds of Zeta's accretion is one mechanism. It is not sprawl — it is the deliberate
per-PR archive, and its README calls it *"the project's most valuable data"*. So the
question was never whether to delete it. It is **where it should live.**

## What moves

| path | today | role |
|---|---:|---|
| `docs/history/pr-reviews/` | 13,983 files, 91,932 KB | the **content** — description, outcome, every review comment and thread |
| `docs/github/prs/` | 13,983 files, 63,460 KB | the **index** — ~10 JSON fields per PR, sharded, plus `manifest.jsonl` |

Both, together. Splitting them would leave an index in one repo pointing at content in
another, which is worse than either arrangement.

**Proposed home:** `Lucent-Financial-Group/zeta-pr-archive`, public, matching Zeta's own
visibility so nothing that is readable today becomes unreadable.

## What stays behind, and why it is not just a link

`docs/history/pr-reviews/README.md` stays, rewritten to say where the archive went and how
to get it. It keeps the *"why this is protected"* section verbatim, because that section is
the reason the data exists and it is addressed to whoever is holding the archive next.

A **one-line pointer file** — `docs/history/pr-reviews/ARCHIVE-MOVED.json` — carries the
repo, the ref, and the commit at which the move happened, so a reader lands on the exact
state Zeta last saw rather than on a moving target.

## `clone-at-tag-stays-sufficient` — the rule this must satisfy

`.claude/rules/clone-at-tag-stays-sufficient.md`: the tree must stay **buildable and
checkable from `git clone` at a pinned tag, with no package manager present, permanently**.

This split satisfies it, and the reason is worth stating precisely rather than asserting:

- **The archive is not on the build or check path.** Nothing compiles it, and no gate leg
  reads it to decide a verdict. `git clone && dotnet build && dotnet test` is unchanged.
- **What the rule actually forbids is a mandatory hub.** A reader who wants the review
  record does `git clone <archive repo>` — plain git, no `ace`, no package manager, no
  credential beyond what Zeta itself needs. That is an oracle they chose, not a hub they
  must route through.

**A submodule is NOT proposed.** A submodule would make the archive a *dependency of the
clone*, which is the opposite of what this is for, and it would put a second repo's
availability on Zeta's checkout path.

## Consumers that must move with it — enumerated, not estimated

Counted on `main` at draft time:

| class | count | disposition |
|---|---:|---|
| TypeScript files naming either path | **41** | the producer/reader set. Most are `src/Core.TypeScript/forge-host/github/*` and their tests |
| workflows naming either path | **5** | `pr-archive-on-merge.yml` (the producer, `pull_request: [closed]`), `pr-manifest-integrity.yml`, `archive-strand-alarm.yml`, `agent-reviewer.yml`, `agent-heartbeat.yml` |
| docs / rules / prose naming either path | **948** | prose. Correct opportunistically; nothing breaks |

**The producer is the load-bearing one.** `pr-archive-on-merge.yml` fires on
`pull_request: [closed]` and writes into Zeta. After the split it must write into the
archive repo instead, which needs a token scoped to that repo — and that is the one genuinely
new piece of machinery this change requires.

**Three of the five workflows are `disabled_manually` today** (`archive-strand-alarm`,
`agent-heartbeat`, and the heartbeat cadences beside them), which lowers the migration cost
and is worth knowing before anyone budgets for it.

## What this buys, and what it does NOT

**Buys:** 64% of file growth and ~44.2 MB/month stop landing in Zeta. Growth continues — in
the repo built to hold it, which is the stated strategy.

**Does NOT buy a smaller `.git`.** Zeta's pack is **285.8 MiB / 247,058 objects** and moving
files forward does not remove their history. Shrinking that requires a **history rewrite**,
which is a gated, non-reversible action only the maintainer authorises, and it invalidates
every existing clone and every commit SHA that names one. **Stopping growth and shrinking
the past are two decisions.** This draft is only the first.

## Order of operations

1. Create the archive repo, public, empty.
2. `git subtree split` / `filter-repo` the two paths into it **with history**, so blame and
   dates survive the move. Push to the new repo. Zeta is untouched at this point.
3. Verify the new repo independently: file counts match (13,983 + 13,983), a sampled PR's
   markdown and its shard both resolve, `derive-pr-manifest.ts` regenerates a manifest that
   agrees with the shards.
4. Repoint `pr-archive-on-merge.yml` at the new repo, with a scoped token. **Watch one real
   merge land there before step 5.**
5. Only then remove the two trees from Zeta, leaving the README and the pointer file.
6. Migrate the 41 TS consumers; correct prose opportunistically.

Step 5 last, and step 4 proven by a live archive write, so there is never a window where a
merged PR's review record is written nowhere.

## The correctness bug that should be fixed BEFORE the move, not during

`docs/github/prs/manifest.jsonl` is **stale**: 13,592 records against 13,982 shards, with
**390 shards absent from it** and 117 more where the shard is newer. Measured, not inferred.

`derive-pr-manifest.ts` already exists, so the manifest is *derivable* — which means the
honest options are to regenerate it or to stop committing it and derive on demand. Either
way, **do it while the data is still in one repo.** Carrying a known-stale index across a
repo boundary is how a small drift becomes an argument about which side is authoritative.

## Open, and Aaron's to answer

1. **Repo name and owner** — `Lucent-Financial-Group/zeta-pr-archive`, or under a different
   org if the archive is meant to outlive this one.
2. **Does the fine-tuning consumer follow it?** The archive's stated purpose is fuel for the
   GitOps training signal. If that pipeline reads from Zeta today, it moves too.
3. **History rewrite, separately.** Whether Zeta's existing 285.8 MiB is ever reclaimed is a
   different decision with a different blast radius, and this draft deliberately does not
   ask for it.
4. **The other growth sources**, unaddressed here and much smaller: `docs/observe-events`
   (+1,295 files/14d), `docs/drift-events` (+930), `workitems` (+1,072). Same shape, one
   file per event. Worth the same question later; not worth bundling into this move.

## Pointers

- `081M1TRJ3X5087G0R0032TNP8H` — the measurement this draft rests on.
- `docs/DECISIONS/2026-04-22-three-repo-split-zeta-forge-ace.md` — the existing split
  decision. This would be a **fourth** repo and a different kind: that split is by
  dependency closure, this one is by change rate (DV2.0 — the archive is a pure satellite,
  append-only, never read by the build).
- `.claude/rules/clone-at-tag-stays-sufficient.md` — the rule §"clone-at-tag" above satisfies.
- `docs/history/pr-reviews/README.md` — the *read-not-refactor* protection and the
  maintainer's own statement of why this data matters.
