# Controlled Vocabulary: Quant × Austrian Synthesis

Four load-bearing terms for the B-0023 research program.
Each definition includes: precise scope, include/exclude examples,
intra-school disputes, and a falsification-criterion.

---

## 1. "Quant-grade mathematical rigor"

### Precise definition

A formalization meets quant-grade mathematical rigor when ALL of:

1. **Stated axioms**: all foundational assumptions are written down
   explicitly in mathematical notation before any derivation begins.
2. **Formal derivation**: every claimed result follows from the
   stated axioms via rules of inference that are either explicitly
   named (e.g., Itô's lemma, dominated convergence, optional
   stopping) or cited in a form that a mathematically-trained
   reader can verify without additional assumptions.
3. **Well-typed terms**: every quantity has a declared mathematical
   type — random variable on a probability space, element of a
   Banach space, stochastic process adapted to a filtration — not
   merely a label on a graph or a value in a table.
4. **Falsifiable embedding**: there exists at least one mapping
   from formal terms to observable quantities such that the theory
   makes a prediction that could in principle be falsified by data.

The "quant" qualifier specifies the mathematical culture: stochastic
calculus, measure-theoretic probability, and functional analysis
are the standard toolkit. A formalization that satisfies (1)–(3)
but uses only high-school algebra qualifies as *mathematical* but
not *quant-grade*.

### Includes (examples that pass)

- Black-Scholes-Merton (1973): axioms explicit (GBM, no-arbitrage),
  derivation via Itô + replicating portfolio, each term typed
  (e.g., `S_t : Ω → ℝ₊` adapted to `𝔽ₜ`), falsifiable via
  option market prices.
- Merton (1974) credit model: same toolkit applied to firm value.
- Duffie-Singleton (1999) term structure: axiomatic affine SDE,
  measure-change derivation, empirically testable yield predictions.
- Any Austrian claim restated as a formal SDE or measure-theoretic
  construct satisfying (1)–(4).

### Excludes (examples that fail, with justification)

- Saifedean Ammous stock-to-flow model: empirical fit without
  formal axioms or type-system; a regression, not a derivation.
  Fails (1) and (2).
- Mises praxeology (raw form): rigorous deductive system but
  terms are not typed in a mathematical sense; "action" is not
  a random variable. Satisfies a form of (1) and (2) but fails
  (3) and (4) under the quant-grade standard.
- Agent-based simulations without measure-theoretic grounding:
  computationally rigorous but not formally derivable in the
  sense above.

### Intra-Austrian disputes affecting scope

- **Mises's praxeology vs. mathematical formalization**: Mises
  and Rothbard explicitly rejected empirical-mathematical methods
  for economic theory (the "a priori economics" position). This
  creates a genuine tension: a "quant-grade Austrian formalization"
  may be considered a category error by orthodox Misesians, while
  Hayekians (especially post-Hayek complexity theorists) are more
  open to formal modeling. This dispute affects the scope of
  row B-0382 (time-preference) and B-0384 (calculation problem)
  most directly.
- **Econophysics adjacency**: the Econophysics tradition
  (Mantegna-Stanley) applies statistical physics to economics;
  this is quant-grade in the sense above but not specifically
  Austrian. Proximity is not identity.

### Falsification-criterion

If a claimed formalization cannot be assigned a type for each term
in a standard graduate mathematical probability textbook (e.g.,
Durrett 2010), or if its derivation depends on an assumption not
stated in the axiom list, the "quant-grade" qualifier is withdrawn.

---

## 2. "Austrian primitive"

### Precise definition

An **Austrian primitive** is a claim in the Austrian-school tradition
that is treated as foundational (not derived from a more basic claim
within the school) AND that:

(a) appears in at least two of {Mises, Hayek, Böhm-Bawerk, Rothbard,
    Kirzner} as a starting point rather than a conclusion, AND
(b) is logically prior in the Austrian derivation order to the
    claims that depend on it.

### Three-layer taxonomy

The Austrian tradition has three logically distinct layers. The
"primitive" qualifier applies primarily to **Layer 1**; Layers 2
and 3 are derived theory and applied theory, respectively.

**Layer 1 — Praxeological core (primitives proper)**

| Primitive | Canonical source | Logical role |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Action axiom (purposeful human behavior) | Mises *Human Action* Ch. 1 | Starting point; not argued from prior premises within praxeology |
| Time-preference (present goods preferred over future goods, ceteris paribus) | Böhm-Bawerk *Capital and Interest* | Derived from action axiom + scarcity; treated as primitive in downstream applications |
| Subjective value (value is ordinal, not cardinal; derives from individual ranking) | Menger *Principles* | Primitive; sets aside utility-function approach |
| Uncertainty and heterogeneous knowledge | Hayek "Use of Knowledge" (1945) | Primitive claim about the epistemic structure of markets |

**Layer 2 — Applied theory (derived from Layer 1)**

ABCT (Austrian Business Cycle Theory), capital-structure
(Hayekian triangle), interest as intertemporal price, price as
knowledge aggregator. These are derived, not primitive.

**Layer 3 — Policy layer (applied under Layer 2)**

Sound-money advocacy, anti-central-planning arguments, free-banking
theory. These are downstream conclusions, not primitives.

### Includes (examples of genuine Austrian primitives)

- Time-preference as a logical precondition for interest
  (Layer 1; formalization target for B-0382)
- The action axiom as the starting point of praxeology
  (Layer 1; not formalized in quant sense — see dispute below)
- Hayek's dispersed-knowledge claim (Layer 1; formalization
  target for B-0384 via information-theoretic framing)

### Excludes (examples that are NOT primitives under this definition)

- Sound-money / hard-cap advocacy: Layer 3 conclusion, not a
  primitive. Treating it as an axiom rather than a derived claim
  is a common rhetorical move that conflates layers.
- ABCT as a whole: Layer 2 derived theory; its components
  (time-preference, roundaboutness, malinvestment) are more
  primitive than ABCT itself.
- "Austrians reject fiat money": policy-layer position, not
  an epistemological or methodological primitive.

### Intra-Austrian disputes affecting scope

- **Mises vs. Hayek on methodology**: Mises's praxeology is purely
  deductive-from-action-axiom, rejecting empirical input at the
  theoretical level. Hayek's knowledge-coordination framework is
  more open to empirical embedding and formal modeling. This means
  B-0382 (time-preference) is more Misesian and may resist
  quant-grade formalization, while B-0384 (calculation problem)
  is more Hayekian and admits information-theoretic restatement.
- **Rothbard's natural-law addition**: Rothbard adds natural-law
  premises to praxeology that are not universally accepted within
  the school. These additions are NOT treated as Austrian primitives
  under this definition because they fail criterion (a) (not
  endorsed as starting points by Hayek or Kirzner).

### Falsification-criterion

If a candidate "primitive" is derivable from another Austrian claim
without additional premises, it is not primitive — it is a derived
theorem in Layer 2. The test: can a skilled Austrian economist
provide a derivation of the candidate from more basic Austrian
claims? If yes, it demotes to Layer 2.

---

## 3. "Formalization"

### Precise definition (three distinct senses)

The term "formalization" covers three distinct operations. Clarity
about which sense is intended changes the research agenda and the
effort estimate by at least one order of magnitude.

**Sense A — Mathematical representation**

Translating a verbal Austrian claim into mathematical notation
without necessarily changing its logical structure or providing
a derivation from more basic premises.

- Example: "time-preference means present goods are preferred to
  future goods" → `u(c_t) + δ · u(c_{t+1}) > u(c_{t+1})` for `δ < 1`.
- Epistemic status: translation, not proof. The claim is now
  expressible in mathematical language but its truth conditions
  are the same as the verbal version.
- Effort: S to M. Almost any Austrian primitive can be given a
  Sense-A formalization quickly.

**Sense B — Rigorous derivation**

Starting from stated axioms (which may or may not be the Austrian
primitives themselves), formally derive the Austrian claim using
quant-grade methods as defined in §1.

- Example: deriving that a competitive equilibrium with time-preference
  implies positive interest rates, starting from a stated set of
  axioms about agent preferences and technology.
- Epistemic status: conditional on the axioms, the claim is proved.
  If the axioms don't match Austrian foundations, the derivation
  proves something compatible with Austrian conclusions but not
  necessarily the Austrian claim itself.
- Effort: M to L. Requires mathematical skill and careful axiom design.

**Sense C — Empirical embedding**

Giving the formalization observable consequences: defining terms
that map to measurable quantities and stating predictions that can
be tested with data.

- Example: specifying that "roundaboutness" corresponds to average
  production duration in input-output tables, then testing whether
  credit expansion produces the predicted lengthening pattern.
- Epistemic status: the claim is now falsifiable.
- Effort: M to L. Requires both the mathematical formalization
  (Sense A or B) and an empirical operationalization.

### What "quant-grade formalization" requires for B-0023

Under the B-0380 vocabulary, **quant-grade formalization** requires
at minimum Sense B (rigorous derivation), ideally Sense C
(empirical embedding). Sense A alone is categorized as
*mathematical representation*, not formalization for the purposes
of the B-0023 research agenda.

### Includes (examples by sense)

- Sense A: expressing time-preference as a discount-factor model.
  Not sufficient for B-0023 claims, but a necessary first step.
- Sense B: Prescott-Mehra puzzle literature — quant-grade derivation
  of equity premium from risk-preference primitives. Not Austrian
  but Sense-B exemplar at the relevant mathematical standard.
- Sense C: Garrison (2001) ABCT chapters — partial empirical
  embedding; below quant-grade standard but directionally correct.

### Excludes

- Sense A alone: Saifedean stock-to-flow fits Sense A (a
  mathematical representation of scarcity) but lacks Sense B
  derivation. Not formalization under B-0023 standard.
- Verbal restatement using Greek letters: not formalization;
  this is notation without mathematical structure.

### Falsification-criterion

A claimed "formalization" that cannot be written in standard
mathematical notation with typed terms and explicit derivation
steps is at most Sense A (representation). Demote accordingly.

---

## 4. "Synthesis gap"

### Precise definition

The **synthesis gap** is the absence of a body of work that achieves
**quant-grade formalization (Sense B or C as defined in §3)** of
**Austrian primitives (Layer 1 as defined in §2)**.

It is NOT merely the observation that "no paper combines both
schools" — that would be a **literature gap** (a gap in the
publication record). The synthesis gap is a **foundations
incompatibility** between the two traditions that makes such a
formalization structurally difficult, not merely historically
overlooked.

### The foundations incompatibility (structural claim)

The quant tradition is built on equilibrium concepts (risk-neutral
measure, no-arbitrage, efficient markets), rational expectations,
and neutral money as background assumptions. Austrian primitives
make claims that conflict with each of these background assumptions:

| Quant background assumption | Austrian conflict |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|
| Markets clear via competitive equilibrium | ABCT: credit expansion prevents true clearing; yields predictable disequilibrium dynamics |
| Money is neutral (long-run) | Sound-money thesis: monetary expansion distorts relative prices, is never neutral |
| Rational expectations (homogeneous information) | Hayek dispersed knowledge: heterogeneous information is the *problem*, not an approximation to fix |
| Preferences are stable and estimable from revealed choice | Subjective value: preferences are ordinal, non-interpersonally-comparable, and resist aggregation |

This means a "quant-grade Austrian formalization" cannot simply
borrow quant machinery wholesale: the machinery presupposes
equilibrium structure that Austrian primitives deny. A genuine
synthesis requires either (a) developing new mathematical tools
that don't presuppose equilibrium, or (b) proving that some
Austrian primitives are compatible with limited-equilibrium
sub-frameworks.

### Literature gap vs. synthesis gap

| Dimension | Literature gap | Synthesis gap (this document) |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Cause | Historical accident, academic silo | Foundations incompatibility |
| Fix | Literature search + assembly | New mathematical framework or compatibility proof |
| Effort | S to M | L to XL |
| Research program | Survey existing work | Develop new theory |

The B-0023 research program investigates a **synthesis gap**, not
merely a literature gap. Treating it as a literature gap
underestimates the effort by at least an order of magnitude and
misdirects the agenda toward existing-paper assembly.

### Intra-synthesis debates affecting scope

- **Hayekian complexity economics** (Beinhocker, Santa Fe Institute):
  applies complex-systems mathematics (power laws, agent-based models)
  to economic process. This is quant-grade in some senses and
  Austrian-compatible in some senses, but it rejects equilibrium in
  a different way than Mises and it is not part of the mainstream
  Austrian academic tradition. It reduces the synthesis gap at the
  Hayekian end but not at the Misesian end.
- **New Monetarist economics**: some authors (Williamson, Wright)
  use search theory (quant-grade) to model money non-neutrality
  (Austrian-compatible conclusion). These papers are closest to the
  synthesis and should be evaluated in B-0381 (literature survey)
  against the definitions here.

### Falsification-criterion

The synthesis gap is **closed** when: a paper or research artifact
achieves quant-grade formalization (Sense B or C) of at least one
Layer-1 Austrian primitive without presupposing equilibrium or
neutral money as background assumptions, and the result is verified
by at least one author outside the producing group. Until that
condition is met, the gap is open.

## Summary table

| Term | Short definition | Passes if | Fails if |
|------|-----------------|-----------|----------|
| Quant-grade rigor | Stated axioms + formal derivation + typed terms + falsifiable embedding | Itô-calculus derivation from explicit premises | Regression without axioms; verbal restatement |
| Austrian primitive | Layer-1 claim endorsed as starting point by ≥2 of {Mises, Hayek, Böhm-Bawerk, Rothbard, Kirzner} | Time-preference, action axiom, dispersed knowledge | Sound-money policy, ABCT conclusions |
| Formalization | Sense B (rigorous derivation) or Sense C (empirical embedding) | Proved theorem from stated axioms | Notation without derivation (Sense A alone) |
| Synthesis gap | Foundations-incompatibility gap, not merely literature gap | — | Closed only when Sense B/C formalization of Layer-1 primitive achieved without equilibrium presupposition |
