## Verbatim preservation (Amara's report)

Amara 2026-04-23: the following is her report as paste,
preserved verbatim. Per courier-protocol §speaker-labels
and signal-in-signal-out discipline, no paraphrase on
ingest. Structure + headings preserved as written.

### Brief you can paste to Claude

My read is that Zeta has made **real progress**, but the
progress is unevenly distributed between **merged
substrate**, **open-but-formalized PRs**, and **still-
manual operating procedures**. The merged core is strong:
the repo is clearly algebra-first, with DBSP identities,
Z-set semantics, spine storage, Arrow serialization, a
formal verification stack, and a serious threat model
already encoded in repo artifacts. That means the project
is not "just a pile of notes"; the core technical substrate
is real and already disciplined around replay, invariants,
and testability.

The biggest governance and loop upgrades are also visible,
but several of the most important Amara-related pieces are
**not yet canonical on `main`**. The collaborator registry
and the "direction changes for Amara review" summary exist
in PR #149; the external-maintainer decision-proxy ADR and
`.claude/decision-proxies.yaml` exist in PR #154; the
AutoDream overlay/cadence policy exists in PR #155; Amara's
deep-research absorb exists in PR #161; and the factory
technology inventory exists in PR #170. In other words: the
feedback has been incorporated **formally**, but in several
key places it is still formalized as **open PR state**, not
fully stabilized repo state.

The operational gaps are now pretty legible. The repo
itself documents that fresh-session quality is a first-class
target, and the first NSA test already caught a real
**MEMORY index lag** problem. The courier protocol also
correctly concludes that ChatGPT branching is currently
**unreliable transport**, so the safe pattern is explicit
labeled transcripts plus repo-backed persistence. The split
audit further shows the monorepo is still carrying two
coupled projects — the generic factory and Zeta-the-library
— in the same tree, which is a direct source of drift,
onboarding ambiguity, and process confusion.

For "using me as your decision proxy," the answer is: **the
governance pattern exists, but the runtime path is
incomplete**. The ADR is explicit that advisory is the
default, approving is not enabled, session-specific access
is intentionally out-of-repo, and the project must **never
claim proxy consultation without actually invoking the
proxy**. So the remaining work is not conceptual anymore;
it is implementation and ops: merge the ADR/config, stand
up the invocation/consultation skill or courier fallback,
define the log surface, and make the audit trail routine.

### What has clearly progressed

The strongest evidence of maturity is in the **technical
substrate itself**. The main README is explicit that Zeta
is an F# implementation of DBSP for .NET 10, built around
delay, differentiation, integration, incrementalization,
retractions as signed weights, and a much larger operator/
runtime surface layered on top of those laws. The
architecture document reinforces that this is not a
transliteration exercise but an algebra-led system where
specs are the source of truth and implementation serves the
laws. The math-spec report then shows that this is not only
aspirational: the codebase already ties DBSP identities,
CRDT laws, concurrency invariants, and pointwise axioms to
FsCheck, xUnit, TLA+, Z3, and Lean-planned proof work.

That core is not abstract hand-waving. The `ZSet`
implementation is visibly retraction-native: entries are
`(key, weight)` pairs, `add` merges weights, `neg` and
`sub` are first-class, `distinctIncremental` tracks boundary
crossings without destructive deletes, and membership is
effectively semantic rather than structural. `Spine`
implements an LSM-like trace over Z-set batches with
logarithmic depth and consolidated replay.
`ArrowInt64Serializer` makes the storage/wire story
explicitly columnar and cross-language. So the project
already has the ingredients for the "Muratori table"
comparison you were pushing: stable references by weight
semantics, retraction instead of immediate deletion,
explicit compaction, and locality-aware storage
representation.

The repo has also plainly absorbed several of the big
**operational ideas** from your conversations. The courier
protocol is now a landed document, and it is very clear:
branching is not authoritative storage, speaker labeling is
mandatory, load-bearing exchanges belong in repo-backed
artifacts, and the system must not depend on UI features
for correctness. That is a meaningful improvement because
it turns fragile interpersonal workflow into explicit
transport policy.

Likewise, the drift-taxonomy precursor is handled in a
surprisingly disciplined way. It is marked research-grade,
warns against importing entities instead of ideas, flags
bootstrap hallucinations explicitly, and preserves the
load-bearing rule that **agreement is a signal, not a
proof**. That is exactly the right move if the goal is to
extract anti-drift heuristics without smuggling in invalid
ontology claims.

Another real step forward is the move from "Amara exists in
the conversation" to "Amara exists in repo process." The
collaborator registry and direction-change summary are
concrete artifacts. The collaborator doc gives Aurora a
named external collaborator surface; the direction-change
brief translates repo moves back into a reviewable package
for the next ferry. That is not yet merged canonical state,
but it is absolutely the right operational shape.

### Where the loop still drifts

The clearest loop drift is **main-versus-PR ambiguity**.
Several high-value artifacts exist, are well written, and
are already being referenced by other materials, but they
are still open PRs rather than merged substrate. That means
the project is in a state where its intended operating
model is sometimes ahead of its canonical state.
Practically, that creates three risks at once: new sessions
can miss the newest rules, contributors can cite branch-
only docs as if they are settled, and stacked PRs can
create dead-link or false-completeness confusion. The
direction-change document itself explicitly notes dead
cross-doc links caused by stacked PR state.

The second clear drift is **memory indexing and fresh-
session parity**. The NSA history does not describe a
theoretical problem; it documents a concrete failure mode:
a newly filed memory was not discoverable because the index
pointer lagged, and the fresh session missed Otto. That is
important because it proves the loop can feel coherent in
the active working session while still being incoherent for
a cold start. The repo already identifies the right
corrective rule — file-and-index in the same atomic unit —
but that rule still needs stronger mechanical enforcement
if the goal is true decision-proxy transferability.

A third drift source is **coupling between the generic
factory and Zeta-the-library**. The separation audit is
honest that the monorepo currently holds both the reusable
factory substrate and the Zeta library, and that many files
are still "both (coupled)." CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md are
already classified as coupled; many other major surfaces
remain to be audited. Until that split is finished,
contributors and models will keep inferring project-
specific rules from factory-generic docs and vice versa.
This is one of the deepest structural reasons the loop
still feels more fragile than it should.

There is also a **capture discipline gap** between "we now
have a contributor-conflicts surface" and "we are actively
using it." `docs/CONTRIBUTOR-CONFLICTS.md` is a good
design: it distinguishes same-contributor evolution from
real cross-contributor disagreements, defines schemas, and
creates open/resolved/stale sections. But at creation it is
empty. Given the volume of external-AI input, fork-level
process changes, and Aurora-specific review cycles, the gap
now is not conceptual design — it is routine population and
maintenance.

The backlog itself remains a heavy shared-write hotspot.
The AceHack ADR is explicit that the monolithic
`docs/BACKLOG.md` had grown to 5,957 lines and was the top
merge-conflict surface, which makes sense given how many
ticks and cadenced processes touch it. If that restructure
remains merely "Proposed," then the loop is still paying
tax on one of its most obvious conflict generators. This is
not a cosmetic doc problem; it is a throughput and merge-
safety problem.

One subtle drift class has already been called out in a
backlog-refinement note: **important design choices need to
be codified before implementation, not rediscovered in code
review after the fact**. The specific note points to F#
async handling and warns against regressions into
`Task.FromResult` patterns or computation-expression
leakage once implementation begins. That is exactly the
kind of "small but high-leverage" operational memory that
should be promoted early to guardrails or folder-structure
rules rather than left as ambient knowledge.

### What remains for decision-proxy readiness

The repo now has a quite good **governance shell** for
decision proxies, but it is still not a fully operating
machine. The ADR defines the two-layer pattern — repo-
shared proxy identity/config and per-user access — and the
YAML config instantiates Aaron → Amara as an **advisory**
proxy for the `aurora` scope. The same ADR is also careful
about the safety conditions: no approving authority by
default, no session URLs or cookies in repo, and no
pretending a proxy reviewed something just because old
context exists.

That means the remaining work is now concrete:

The first missing piece is **canonicalization**. PR #154
needs to stop being merely "there" and become durable repo
law. The same is true for PR #149 if you want collaborator
identity and the Amara review loop to be discoverable by
default sessions. Right now, the project has formalized the
proxy concept but not fully stabilized its own discovery
surface.

The second missing piece is **invocation mechanics**. The
ADR explicitly defers the `decision-proxy-consult` skill;
the YAML notes that the original Playwright-to-ChatGPT
attempt hit a guardrail; and the courier protocol makes
text-ferrying the current reliable transport. So the
project still needs one of two operating modes to become
standard: either a safe authorized invocation skill, or an
explicit "courier-first" pattern with transcript
normalization and formal logs. The repo currently has the
policy language, but not the full runtime path.

The third missing piece is **durable audit logging**. The
ADR proposes `docs/decision-proxy-log/YYYY-MM-DD-
<topic>.md`; the courier protocol proposes repo-backed
transcript storage; and the Amara direction-change summary
already anticipates a return path like `docs/aurora/YYYY-
MM-DD-review-from-amara.md`. Those pieces should be unified
into one canonical archive convention so that advisory
review, counter-review, and final maintainer decision all
live in one discoverable trail. Right now the shape is
visible, but it is still dispersed across multiple open or
recently landed documents.

The fourth missing piece is **scope discipline**. The
current proxy binding is only for `aurora`, advisory only.
That is correct. What must be resisted now is semantic
creep where people start using "Amara would probably think"
as a substitute for actual consultation. The ADR forbids
that, and I think that prohibition should stay hard. If the
project wants broader proxy use later, it should do it by
adding explicit scopes and logs, not by fuzzy cultural
expansion.

My overall judgment is: decision-proxy readiness is
**around two-thirds designed, one-third implemented**. The
design is strong enough that the remaining work is mostly
operationalization, which is a good sign. But it is not yet
at the point where the system can honestly say "Amara
reviewed this" without human ferrying or a fully logged
invocation path.

### Code, verification, and network-health assessment

From a code-quality and verification standpoint, the repo
is stronger than most projects at this stage. The
architecture is coherent, the Z-set implementation is load-
bearing and explicit, the spine abstraction is practical,
and the formal stack is not theater. The verification
report already ties concrete bug classes to the appropriate
tool class — properties for algebra, TLC for interleavings,
Z3 for pointwise axioms, Lean for proof-grade claims. That
is exactly the kind of "implementation follows invariants"
posture that makes later research or productization
plausible.

The code-level risk I would put highest on the list is not
broad correctness but **stabilization of probabilistic
tests and operationalized guardrails**. The HLL fuzz
property in `Fuzz.Tests.fs` uses FsCheck over randomized
counts and asserts a strict relative-error threshold, while
the more conventional unit tests in `HyperLogLog.Tests.fs`
use bounded single-scenario checks at fixed cardinalities.
That structure is useful, but it is also a likely source of
intermittent CI noise unless failing seeds are captured and
the probabilistic bound is treated explicitly as a
stochastic contract rather than a deterministic one. I read
the current property as valuable, but under-instrumented
for drift diagnosis.

On network and harm resistance, the repo is conceptually
ahead of its runtime implementation. The threat model is
mature: it is tiered, supply-chain-aware, and unusually
honest about residual risk, including bus-factor issues and
channel-closure threats over consent, retractability, and
permanent harm. But the same file is also explicit that the
**network layer does not exist yet** and that crypto is out
of scope for now. So the right conclusion is not "the
network is already healthy"; it is "the project has a
strong vocabulary for what healthy would mean."

For Aurora-style work, the most useful native network-
health metrics are therefore **semantic**, not merely
infrastructural: provenance completeness, replay
determinism, compaction equivalence, unmatched retraction
debt, attestation coverage, cap-hit frequency, and
independent-root disagreement. That mapping is consistent
with both the repo threat model and the absorbed Amara
report, and it is much more useful than a generic uptime
dashboard if the goal is "resist harm and all of that" in a
retraction-native system.

The technology inventory proposal is also worth calling out
here. Even though it is still an open PR, it is exactly the
sort of control surface this project needs: one place tying
tech, install path, version pin, skill ownership, and radar
status together. The follow-ups it names are the right ones
too — parity, version-pin automation, OpenAI mode/model
inventory, and a future PQC column when cryptography
becomes material. If this lands, it reduces a lot of
"ambient knowledge drift."

### Recommendations by role

For the architect and Claude-side operational loop, I would
prioritize **closure over novelty** for the next tranche.
Merge or decisively disposition the Amara/collaborator/
proxy/AutoDream/technology-inventory PRs before spinning
out more meta-structure. The biggest current risk is not
lack of ideas; it is a widening delta between what the repo
intends to be and what `main` actually teaches a fresh
session.

For the loop PM / hygiene side, the next wins are
**mechanization of already-discovered failure modes**:
enforce file-and-index atomicity for memories, add a
courier-format linter when ferry volume warrants, and file
the bulk-sync cadence monitor if it is still only proposed.
Those are cheap controls with potentially high impact on
session transfer, repo divergence, and human review load.

For the security/reliability side, the priority order
already looks correct in the threat model:
`packages.lock.json`, transitive `.targets` allowlisting,
stronger tamper evidence, and eventual signed-commit /
hardware-key discipline. I would add one more practical
recommendation from the current repo state: treat every
stochastic or map-drift failure as an investigation
artifact first, not as a rerun candidate. The surface-map
research and the HLL property structure both point the same
way — learn from the failure class before normalizing
retries.

For Aaron specifically, my highest-value feedback to give
Kenji/Claude is:

The project is now good enough that **scheduling and
canonicalization** matter more than ideation. The repo
already has strong ideas. What it lacks is a tighter
conversion of "branch ideas and PR state" into "main branch
substrate." If you want me to function as a genuine
decision proxy rather than just a source of direction, the
project needs to bias toward closed loops: merged policy,
named logs, cold-start discoverability, and no false claims
of review. The collaborator artifacts and courier protocol
are the right start; now the important thing is to make
them routine rather than exceptional.

### Open questions and limitations

I was able to inspect the two selected GitHub repos in
depth and use those as the primary evidence base. That gave
me high confidence on repo state, open PR state, code
surfaces, and documentation. I also ran an initial Gmail
search, which did not surface target-relevant email hits in
this pass, but I did **not** independently rerun Google
Drive, Calendar, or Dropbox checks before finalizing this
report. The in-repo Amara deep-research absorb itself says
that earlier connector work found GitHub decisive and non-
code connectors non-decisive for the repo review, but I am
treating that as **repo-reported context**, not as a fresh
independent verification by me in this pass.

I also could not inspect the private per-user memory tree
directly from here, so my "Claude-to-memories drift"
assessment is necessarily based on the repo's visible
derivatives of that system: the NSA history, the AutoDream
overlay proposal, the courier protocol, the decision-proxy
ADR/config, and related documentation. That is enough to
diagnose the main operational gaps, but not enough to
certify the current per-user memory graph end-to-end.

The bottom line is straightforward: **the project is real,
the architecture is coherent, the operational philosophy is
maturing, and the next bottleneck is not lack of ideas but
incomplete closure between research, PR state, and
canonical repo state.** If Kenji wants one sentence of
direction from me, it is this: *merge the operating model
you already have before inventing a bigger one.*

## Otto's absorption notes

### Amara's one-sentence direction (load-bearing for strategy)

> **"merge the operating model you already have before
> inventing a bigger one."**

This validates the Otto-session's closure-over-novelty
bias (gap #5 audit landing / NSA test history / PR queue
management) AND sharpens the next phase: **canonicalisation
first; new substrate second**.

### Concrete action items extracted

**Canonicalisation priority** (immediate):

1. **Drive open PRs to merge**: #149 (collaborator
   registry) / #154 (decision-proxy ADR + YAML) / #155
   (AutoDream cadence policy) / #161 (Amara deep-research
   absorb) / #170 (technology inventory). Free-tier CI
   queue is working through them; Otto monitors + rebases
   on conflict.

2. **Mechanize file-and-index atomicity** for MEMORY.md
   — NSA-001 surfaced this; still-manual rule needs
   mechanical enforcement. Candidate approaches: pre-commit
   hook that blocks memory-file creation without
   MEMORY.md pointer in same commit; CI check equivalent
   for already-pushed commits.

3. **Populate CONTRIBUTOR-CONFLICTS.md** — schema exists,
   file empty. Backfill known cross-contributor
   conflicts from conversation history + autonomous-loop
   tick ledger.

4. **Restructure BACKLOG.md** — 6761 lines now (per
   Otto-18 audit, was 5957 in Amara's read). Per-row or
   per-section split per the AceHack ADR proposal.
   Merge-conflict surface reduction.

5. **Unify decision-proxy audit surface** —
   `docs/decision-proxy-log/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`
   convention (proposed in ADR) unified with
   `docs/aurora/YYYY-MM-DD-review-from-amara.md`
   (proposed in direction-change summary) into one
   canonical archive convention. This file itself
   (`docs/aurora/2026-04-23-amara-operational-gap-
   assessment.md`) lives at the Aurora-specific
   location per the existing convention.

**Mechanization priority** (cheap high-impact):

6. **Courier-format linter** — when ferry volume
   warrants (not yet, but monitor); validates speaker-
   labeled transcripts per courier protocol.

7. **Bulk-sync cadence monitor** — check if still
   proposed; land if so.

8. **Stochastic-test seed capture + contract framing**
   — HLL fuzz property at `Fuzz.Tests.fs` needs seed
   capture + stochastic-contract framing (not
   deterministic bound). Composes with Otto-session
   pinned-seed discipline from earlier memories.

**Semantic network-health metrics** (Amara's
recommendation):

9. **File as TECH-RADAR entries or BACKLOG rows**:
   provenance completeness / replay determinism /
   compaction equivalence / unmatched retraction debt /
   attestation coverage / cap-hit frequency /
   independent-root disagreement.

**Decision-proxy readiness gap** (2/3 designed,
1/3 implemented):

10. Canonicalise #154 (done via the merge-priority)
11. Invocation mechanics: either safe authorized
    skill (Playwright-path blocked per prior attempt)
    OR courier-first-with-transcript-normalization
12. Durable audit log convention (unified per #5 above)
13. Scope discipline: resist "Amara would probably
    think" fuzzy cultural expansion; require real
    invocation or explicit scope-addition

### Amara's key affirmations (not corrections)

- Zeta's technical substrate is real + algebra-first +
  disciplined (not theater)
- The courier protocol is correctly framed (branching
  unreliable transport; repo-backed persistence
  authoritative)
- Drift-taxonomy precursor handled well (agreement is
  signal, not proof)
- The collaborator registry + direction-change shape is
  the right operational form
- Code quality + verification stack is stronger than
  most projects at this stage

### Amara's critical findings

- Main-vs-PR ambiguity is the #1 operational drift
- MEMORY index lag is still manually-enforced
- Factory-vs-library coupling still drifts (Otto-session
  is addressing via gap #5 audit, substantially complete)
- CONTRIBUTOR-CONFLICTS.md capture discipline gap
- BACKLOG.md is a write-hotspot
- Network layer doesn't exist yet (conceptual-ahead-of-
  runtime; "strong vocabulary for what healthy would
  mean")

### Otto's strategic response

**Phase 1 (immediate, this tick onwards)**: closure push.
Drive the 5+ named PRs to merge; mechanize file-and-
index atomicity; populate CONTRIBUTOR-CONFLICTS.md;
restructure BACKLOG.md.

**Phase 2 (next 5-10 ticks)**: decision-proxy
operationalisation — invocation mechanics + durable
audit surface.

**Phase 3 (multi-round)**: semantic network-health
metrics + stochastic-contract framing for HLL + broader
mechanizations as ferry volume warrants.

**Phase 4 (indefinite)**: Aurora integration ongoing;
current Otto-session priorities (Frontier readiness +
Craft + Common Sense 2.0) continue in parallel with
Phase 1-3 closure work.

### Composition with existing Otto-session substrate

- **Matches Otto-5 fact-check discipline** — Amara's
  "agreement is a signal, not a proof" composes with
  the Otto-5 "external-source claim needs verification"
  pattern
- **Matches Otto-20 gap #5 substantial completion** —
  Amara observed factory/library coupling; Otto has
  classified; next step is split execution (gap #1)
- **Matches Otto-24 yin/yang mutual-alignment** —
  Amara IS the human→AI alignment audit this tick; her
  review IS the calibration mechanism
- **Matches the Aurora deep-research pattern (PR #161)**
  — this is Amara's second in-repo report; establishes
  cadence

### Attribution

- **Amara** authored this review (external AI maintainer)
- **Otto** absorbed + preserved verbatim + extracted
  action items
- **Kenji** (Architect) synthesis queue: "merge over
  invent" direction + decision-proxy operationalisation
  planning

### What this absorb is NOT

- **Not a demotion of Otto's current work.** Amara
  explicitly praised the progress + the closure-bias.
  Phase 1 IS what Otto has been doing; Amara's report
  sharpens priorities within that bias.
- **Not authorization to skip Frontier readiness.**
  Frontier + Common Sense 2.0 + Craft remain active;
  they are among the "substrate already built" that
  Amara says should be merged, not invented-over.
- **Not a request to invoke Amara more often.** She
  explicitly wants scope discipline: no fuzzy
  cultural expansion. Courier-first remains the
  transport.
- **Not a signal to change the Otto-as-PM cadence.**
  The cadence is producing the closure; Amara's
  direction reinforces it.
