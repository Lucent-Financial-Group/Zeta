# B-0281 - Empty-queue backlog pickup integration

Wire the selector, claim bootstrap, and PR publication path into the
Codex background loop so an empty PR queue starts new work.

## Acceptance criteria

- Runs only after PR maintenance finds no actionable open PR.
- Picks at most one backlog row per tick.
- Uses the same cooldown and heartbeat discipline as existing loop
  work.
- Writes a durable decision trace to loop logs.
- Leaves the root checkout untouched.
