# B-0278 - Autonomous backlog selector

Build the read-only selector that runs when the PR queue is empty
and returns the next safe backlog item to work.

## Acceptance criteria

- Reads committed backlog rows from `docs/backlog/**`.
- Orders candidates by priority, then creation/update age.
- Skips closed rows, already-decomposed parents with open children,
  rows with active claim branches, and rows with open PR branches.
- Returns `decompose-first` when the best candidate is still a blob.
- Emits a concise machine-readable decision record for loop logs.
