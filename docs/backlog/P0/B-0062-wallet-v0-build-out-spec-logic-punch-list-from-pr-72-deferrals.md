The EAT packet + wallet v0 operational spec PR (#72) absorbed
the research-grade docs but had ~15 review threads that
flagged real spec-logic gaps. Those threads were resolved
with "acknowledged + filed under v0 build-out phase" replies.
The honest tracking is THIS row, so the deferred concerns
don't get lost in closed-thread comments.

## Context

PR #72 framing: research-grade absorb of the EAT canonical
packet + wallet v0 operational specification. Not canonical
doctrine. Not a build-out commitment. The deferred concerns
are appropriate for the implementation phase when state-
machine shapes will be surfaced by real code, not for the
research-grade absorb scope the PR represents.

Aaron 2026-04-28 honest-tracking catch:

> *"bulk-resolve what is buld resolve does it actually answer
> the questions? or does it just close them? have they been
> answered?"*

Translation: deferral is fine, but it must be tracked. A
"deferred to v0 build-out" reply on a closed thread is not
tracking; it's papering. This row converts the deferred
threads into a concrete actionable punch list.

## Punch list (resolve before v0 acceptance, not before this PR merge)

Each item references the PR #72 review thread that surfaced
it (closed-thread links survive in the PR's review history).

### Spec-logic — preflight retraction state machine

1. **Add a terminal path for preflight-retracted proposals**
   (cid 3151220960 P1). The tick state machine currently
   enforces `signed → broadcast → settled`; a preflight-
   retracted proposal has no terminal state. The wallet
   spec needs an explicit `preflight-retracted` terminal
   state with the receipt-schema fields the monitor will
   write.

   **Resolved (Vera 2026-05-08):** Add `retracted`
   terminal state: `signed → retracted`. The receipt
   for a retracted proposal uses the nullable tx block
   (PR #1922) and records `pre_flight_retracted: true`
   + `retraction_reason`. The state machine becomes:
   `signed → broadcast → settled` (normal) OR
   `signed → retracted` (preflight cancellation). The
   wallet v0 spec now lands this in §7.3 and preserves the
   standing query correction below.

   **Aaron correction (2026-05-07):** Terminal state is the
   sharp edge of one proposal instance, not the round shape
   of the standing Rx query. Retraction is a delta/receipt;
   it closes that local proposal without popping the standing
   query wave. The query remains live, and any materialized
   cache is reconstructable (`cache = I o D`) rather than
   load-bearing lifecycle state.
2. **Drop the impossible pre-broadcast classification freeze
   trigger** (cid 3150897609 P1). §6.1 currently freezes
   when the pre-flight retraction monitor disagrees with
   the agent's classification, but the spec also says
   classification happens post-broadcast. The two
   statements can't both be true. Decision needed: does
   classification happen pre- or post-broadcast?

   **Resolved (Otto 2026-05-07):** No actual contradiction.
   The pre-broadcast freeze (§9.1 line 431) is about THESIS
   disagreement ("monitor's reasoning-trace check disagrees
   with the agent's thesis"), not classification disagreement.
   Classification IS post-broadcast (§6.1 lines 249-253
   confirm: "classification follows broadcast, not signed").
   Two different gates at two different stages. The original
   item conflated thesis-review with classification-review.
3. **Add a pre-broadcast freeze terminal state** (cid
   3151408384 P1). §9.1 allows the monitor to trigger
   `freeze-on-dissent` before broadcast — the spec needs
   the matching terminal state in the tick state machine.

   **Resolved (Vera 2026-05-08):** Add `frozen`
   terminal state: `signed → frozen`. Distinct from
   `retracted` (agent-initiated) — `frozen` is
   monitor/Aaron-initiated. Unfreeze (per §6.2:
   smart-contract + Aaron) transitions back to
   `signed` for re-evaluation. State machine:
   `signed → broadcast → settled` (normal) OR
   `signed → retracted` (agent cancels) OR
   `signed → frozen` (monitor/Aaron freezes). The wallet v0
   spec now lands this in §7.3.
4. **Make tx-receipt fields optional for preflight retractions**
   (cid 3151233788 P1). Receipt schema currently requires
   on-chain transaction fields (`hash`, `block_number`,
   etc.); a preflight-retracted proposal has no on-chain
   transaction. Schema needs `Optional<>` markers for the
   on-chain-only fields.

   **Resolved:** PR #1922 made the on-chain `tx` fields nullable
   for `pre_flight_retracted = true` receipts.

### Spec-logic — agent self-revocation

1. **Define a revocation auth path the agent can actually use**
   (cid 3151301493 P1). §9.1 requires the agent to self-
   revoke via a call authenticated by the active session
   key, but §3.3/§3.4 say the agent doesn't hold keys.
   Reconcile: either the agent has a session-key signed
   mandate (separate from tx-signing), or the revocation
   goes through a different auth channel (oracle, monitor-
   signed message, etc.).

   **Resolved (Vera 2026-05-08):** Agent holds a
   ZeroDev session-key mandate scoped to
   RETRACTION-ONLY (cancel own proposal during
   retraction window). Not tx-signing — cancellation
   only. §3.3/§3.4 "no keys" means no TX-SIGNING
   keys; a retraction-scoped session key is not a
   contradiction — it's a permission boundary. The
   ZeroDev session-key permission model (§12.1)
   already supports scoped mandates. The wallet v0 spec now
   lands this in §3.3 and §9.1.

2. **Clarify §9.1 revocation mechanism vs §3.3/§3.4 no-keys**
   (cid 3151222680 P1). Same root cause as item 1 above.

   **Resolved (Vera 2026-05-08):** Same resolution as
   item 1. §3.3/§3.4 should say "no tx-signing keys"
   not "no keys." The retraction-scoped session key
   is explicitly allowed. The wallet v0 spec now states that
   retraction authority can cancel only; it cannot sign or
   broadcast a new tx, and the agent still receives no raw key
   custody.

### Spec-logic — monitor placement + lifecycle

1. **§12.5 sibling-repo vs in-repo monitor reconciliation**
   (cids 3151300145, 3151300160 P1). §12.5 RESOLVED the
   monitor implementation to a sibling repository; the
   acceptance criteria + Phase 1 roadmap still permit the
   in-repo `tools/wallet-monitor/` form factor. Pick one.

   **Resolved:** The wallet v0 acceptance criteria and Phase 1
   roadmap now require sibling repo
   `Lucent-Financial-Group/wallet-monitor`; in-repo
   `tools/wallet-monitor/` is explicitly not permitted at the v0
   gate.
2. **Topology section alignment with §12.1 framework choice**
   (cid 3151260676 P2). Topology section still labels the
   smart-account framework as "open question" but §12.1
   RESOLVED it to ZeroDev-on-7702. Update topology to
   match.

   **Resolved:** The wallet v0 acceptance criteria, topology,
   and §12.1 now consistently bind v0 to ZeroDev-on-7702.
3. **Phase 1 roadmap sibling-repo monitor requirement**
   (cid 3151260677 P2). Phase 1 still lists "stub
   tools/wallet-monitor/ directory or sibling-repo
   bootstrap"; §12.5 RESOLVED removes the "or in-repo"
   option. Update roadmap.

   **Resolved:** The Phase 1 roadmap now says to bootstrap the
   sibling repo and names the in-repo monitor option as removed.

### Spec-logic — monitor-stall freeze + classification

1. **Enforce monitor-stall freeze before broadcast**
    (cid 3151321309 P1). The spec requires the monitor
    pipeline to complete within 60s; needs an explicit
    `freeze-on-monitor-stall` rule + the terminal state
    that the freeze creates.

    **Resolved (Vera 2026-05-08):** The wallet v0 spec now
    lands this in §6.1 and §9.1. Monitor stall triggers
    `signed → frozen` before broadcast via the same off-chain
    monitor path as freeze-on-dissent; unfreeze follows §6.2
    and requires receipt-loop catch-up.
2. **Define an on-chain classification signal for Tx N+1
    gating** (cid 3151333578 P1). §7.1 requires the
    smart-account contract to reject Tx N+1 if Tx N's
    classification is unresolved. The spec doesn't define
    where the contract reads the classification signal
    from (oracle? monitor-signed message? bond escrow?).
    Pick one.

    **Resolved (Vera 2026-05-08):** Monitor-signed
    classification message — same pattern as the drawdown
    oracle. Monitor classifies Tx N, signs the result,
    posts to smart-account. Contract checks for signed
    classification before allowing Tx N+1. Minimum signed
    payload: `chainId`, smart-account address, Tx N
    identifier, classification value, monotonic nonce or
    round, and expiry. The wallet v0 spec now lands this in
    §7.1: monitor signs, contract verifies signature +
    reads value + freshness before Tx N+1 is allowed.

### Spec-logic — drawdown oracle + glass-halo logging

1. **Define a deterministic oracle for drawdown freeze
    checks** (cid 3151362883 P1). §5.5 requires the
    smart-account to freeze when bond drawdown crosses a
    threshold. The on-chain check needs a deterministic
    oracle (Chainlink? own pricing oracle? off-chain
    monitor-signed update?). Spec needs the choice.

    **Resolved (Vera 2026-05-08):** Monitor-signed price
    update. The off-chain monitor already watches drawdown;
    it signs its price observation and posts to the
    smart-account. No Chainlink dependency (external vendor
    risk for v0 small-bond scale). No custom oracle contract
    (complexity). The monitor IS the oracle — it just signs.
    Minimum signed payload: asset identifier, price,
    decimals, `chainId`, smart-account address, monotonic
    nonce or round, and timestamp + expiry. The wallet v0
    spec now lands this in §5.5. Revisable at v0+1 if
    Chainlink or custom oracle adds value at larger scale.
2. **Move glass-halo logging gate out of smart-contract
    enforcement** (cid 3151362886 P1). The spec currently
    makes "logging failure ⇒ tx fails" an on-chain
    enforcement rule. Logging is off-chain infrastructure;
    making it a contract-level gate is a separation-of-
    concerns mistake. Move to off-chain monitor.

    **Resolved (Vera 2026-05-08):** The wallet v0 spec now
    clarifies §6.1 and §7.1: the smart-account only enforces
    the monitor-signed classification flag. It does not verify
    git / glass-halo writes. Missing receipts, failed writes,
    or tx-broadcast-without-substrate are off-chain monitor
    anomalies that trigger freeze and receipt-loop catch-up.

### Acceptance-criteria + auth + metric alignment

1. **Require auth for retraction-queue cancellation** (cid
    3150816618 P1). The spec currently says a pending
    transaction can be self-revoked without auth; needs
    the auth path matching item 1 in 'Spec-logic —
    agent self-revocation'.

    **Resolved (Vera 2026-05-08):** Same retraction-
    scoped session key from the self-revocation
    proposal. Agent authenticates
    cancellation via the ZeroDev session-key mandate
    scoped to retraction-only. The wallet v0 spec now lands
    this in §3.3 and §9.1.
2. **Material-spend criteria for second-agent review** (cid
    3151321306 P2). Receipt schema makes `second_agent_
    review.required` a boolean; spec needs the predicate
    that decides when it's required (spend > $X? new
    counterparty? new venue?).

    **Resolved (Vera 2026-05-08):** require second-agent
    review when any of these are true: amount exceeds 10%
    of remaining bond; counterparty is absent from prior
    receipts; venue is absent from prior receipts.
    Conservative for v0. Revisable as the bond grows. The
    wallet v0 spec now lands this in §7.2.1 and blocks
    broadcast until required review is approved.
3. **Align retraction metric with updated Base reorg
    policy** (cid 3150816620 P2). Retraction metric still
    requires "reorg-window monitored after" the §12.2
    Base-reorg policy. Update to current policy.

    **Resolved (Vera 2026-05-08):** EAT §9 and wallet spec
    §9.3 now align: Base v0 does not require "reorg-window
    monitored after broadcast" because Flashblocks
    preconfirmation makes that signal non-meaningful for the
    v0 metric. The chain-finality subsection re-enters scope
    if v0 moves off Base.
4. **Unify the unfreeze quorum across sections** (cid
    3151220963 P2). Test text requires "Aaron-plus-monitor"
    for unfreeze; §6.2 defines a different quorum. Pick
    one + propagate.

   **Resolved:** PR #1923 made the §11.3 dry-run test match
   §6.2: smart-contract-guard-plus-Aaron is required to
   unfreeze; the off-chain monitor cannot unilaterally
   unfreeze.
5. **§15 send-readiness statement reconciliation** (cid
    3150897613 P2). §15 says only two maintainer-only
    questions remain; current state is §12.1-§12.6
    Otto-resolved + §12.7-§12.8 Aaron-resolved. Refresh
    statement.

    **Resolved:** EAT §21 and wallet spec §15 now state that
    the maintainer-only questions are resolved; wallet v0 spec
    acceptance opens at the real-money phase rather than being
    blocked by stale §12 open-question text.
6. **EAT retraction-coverage metric alignment with wallet
    spec** (cid 3151233791 P2). Companion-spec drift
    between EAT doc and wallet v0; align metric.

    **Resolved (Vera 2026-05-08):** EAT §9 now mirrors wallet
    spec §9.3: retraction coverage counts the pre-flight
    retraction window plus failed-attempt receipt logging, and
    explicitly excludes Base reorg-window monitoring.
7. **EAT Task B in-repo monitor option removal** (cid
    3151301494 P2). EAT Task B still permits in-repo
    monitor form factor; align with §12.5 sibling-repo
    resolution.

    **Resolved:** EAT Task B now requires the sibling repo
    `Lucent-Financial-Group/wallet-monitor` for the off-chain
    monitor harness, matching wallet spec §12.5.

### Schema migration

1. **INTENTIONAL-DEBT.md YAML schema vs current prose
    format** (cid 3151337321 P1). Spec proposes recording
    bond entries in a YAML schema; INTENTIONAL-DEBT.md is
    currently a prose/bulleted ledger. Either land the
    YAML schema migration (separate ADR + tooling), or
    define bond entries in the existing prose format
    until the schema lands.

    **Resolved (Vera 2026-05-08):** Defer YAML schema to
    v0+1. For v0, wallet spec §8.1 now maps blast-radius
    bond entries onto the existing `docs/INTENTIONAL-DEBT.md`
    six-field prose contract. A YAML migration becomes a
    separate ADR + tooling task only when multiple bonds,
    assets, or automated accounting make machine-readable
    schema worth its maintenance cost.

## Done-criteria

Each punch-list item resolved with either:

+ (a) A spec edit landing the chosen mechanism + its
  rationale, OR
+ (b) An ADR documenting "we considered this; here's why
  we're going with X over Y," OR
+ (c) An explicit "out of scope for v0; defer to v0+1"
  with a follow-up backlog row.

When all 21 items have one of these three resolutions,
this row closes.

## Why this row exists

Aaron 2026-04-28: *"bulk-resolve what is buld resolve does
it actually answer the questions? or does it just close
them? have they been answered?"* — caught the failure mode
where I closed threads with deferral notes but didn't track
the deferrals anywhere actionable. Honest tracking IS the
fix. The thread closures stay (PR #72 mergeable as research-
grade absorb), but the substantive concerns now have a
concrete punch list, not just scattered closed-thread
comments.

0 items remain. B-0062 is closed.

2026-05-07 red-team correction: PR #1942 briefly marked
this row closed by trusting a "21/21 addressed" pickup
summary, but this file still records 8 of 21 resolved and
13 remaining design decisions. Reopening preserves the
original done-criteria: the row closes only when every
punch-list item has a spec edit, ADR, or explicit v0+1
deferral with follow-up tracking.

## Composes with

+ **B-0060** — human-lineage / external-anchor backfill (the
  spec mechanisms picked here should cite their external
  prior art per the same rule).
+ **B-0061** — backlog migration (this row IS in per-row
  format; B-0061 is the meta-task tracking the rest).
+ The closed PR #72 review threads survive in the PR's
  history; this row references them by `cid=NNNNNNNNNN` so
  the original reviewer's framing is recoverable.
