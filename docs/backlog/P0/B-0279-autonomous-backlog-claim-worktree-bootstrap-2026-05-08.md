# B-0279 - Claim and worktree bootstrap

Create the isolated write surface for a selected backlog row before
any file edits happen.

## Acceptance criteria

- Creates or updates the git-native claim for the selected row.
- Uses a dedicated worktree rooted at current `origin/main`.
- Refuses to write in the contested root checkout.
- Records the selected path set before edits begin.
- Fails closed if another active claim overlaps the path set.
