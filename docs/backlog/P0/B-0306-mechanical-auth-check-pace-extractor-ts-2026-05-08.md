# B-0306 — Pace-instruction extractor + test fixtures

## What

TDD-first: write the test fixtures that define the contract, then
the TS implementation that satisfies them. The extractor reads
substrate surfaces (CLAUDE.md, `memory/feedback_*.md` files,
`CURRENT-aaron.md`, `docs/active-trajectory.md`) and returns a
typed list of raw pace-instruction candidate records with source
attribution, timestamp, and raw text. The extractor does NOT
determine rescind status — that is the resolver's job (B-0307).

Lands at `tools/authorization/pace-extractor.ts` with paired
test at `tools/authorization/pace-extractor.test.ts`.

## Acceptance criteria

1. **Test fixtures** (write first) cover:
   - Single pace instruction → extracted correctly with source
     attribution
   - Two instructions, both from maintainer → both returned in
     chronological order
   - Peer-AI framing (Claude.ai, Amara, Codex) present in
     substrate → extracted with `source: "claude.ai"` (etc.)
     so the resolver can filter by source
   - No pace instruction in substrate → empty array
   - Instruction containing explicit rescind language → extracted
     with raw text preserved (rescind-detection is resolver's
     responsibility in B-0307)
2. **Implementation** reads from (all surfaces listed in B-0160):
   - `CLAUDE.md` pace bullets (grep for pace-relevant patterns)
   - `memory/feedback_*.md` files (parse frontmatter + body for
     pace-instructions)
   - `memory/CURRENT-aaron.md` (if exists — distilled projection)
   - `docs/active-trajectory.md` (current operative authorizations)
3. Returns typed `PaceInstruction[]` with fields:
   `{ source: string; timestamp: string | null; raw: string;
     file: string }`.
   Note: no `rescinded` field — rescind-detection is a resolver
   concern (B-0307), not an extraction concern. The extractor
   returns ALL candidates; the resolver determines which are
   operative.
4. Pure function on file content (no side effects) — accepts a
   root-path argument for testability.
5. TypeScript, runs under Bun (Rule 0).

## Pre-start checklist

_To be completed with proof before implementation begins._

- [ ] Prior-art search: searched skill router, `.claude/skills/`,
  `tools/`, `memory/` for existing pace-extraction substrate
- [ ] Dependency walk: B-0160 parent verified as `decomposed`,
  no unresolved `depends_on` for this child
- [ ] Reciprocal pointers: B-0307 `depends_on` includes this row

## Composes with

- B-0160 (parent umbrella)
- B-0305 (skill body defines the contract this tool implements)
- B-0307 (resolver consumes this extractor's output)
