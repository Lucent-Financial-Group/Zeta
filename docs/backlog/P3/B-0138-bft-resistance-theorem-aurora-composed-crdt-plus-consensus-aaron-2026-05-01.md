# B-0138 — BFT-resistance theorem for Aurora

**Priority:** P3 (research-grade; full formal proof of Aurora's BFT-resistance; multi-year work).

**Filed:** 2026-05-01.

**Effort:** XL (multi-year — full BFT-resistance proof for the composed system).

## What

Prove the full BFT-resistance theorem for the Aurora layer: composed-CRDT-from-B-0132 + consensus-protocol-on-top guarantees Byzantine fault tolerance under stated assumptions (≤ f Byzantine actors out of 3f+1 total, network model assumptions, cryptographic assumptions on signatures).

## Acceptance criteria

1. **Aurora system specified formally** — composed CRDT (per B-0132) + chosen consensus protocol (PBFT, HotStuff, Tendermint family).
2. **BFT-resistance theorem stated** with explicit assumptions: maximum Byzantine fraction, network synchrony model, cryptographic primitives.
3. **Full proof** — most likely composes existing results from BFT-consensus literature with B-0132's CRDT-composition proof.
4. **Edge-privacy claim composed** — Aurora's edge-privacy guarantees per `memory/feedback_great_data_homecoming_aurora_edge_privacy_runtime_wwjd_canonicalization_temple_template_aaron_2026_05_01.md` should compose with the BFT-resistance proof.
5. **Academic-distributed-systems-researcher review** per lattice-capture corrective.

## Composes with

- B-0132 (CRDT-composition for BFT propagation) — the composed-CRDT layer.
- B-0131 (Z-set Lean) — Z-set semantics underpin retraction-CRDT composition.
- BFT consensus literature (Castro & Liskov 1999; HotStuff 2019; Tendermint).
- `memory/feedback_ai_never_without_human_who_understands_both_ai_and_earth_technology_aaron_2026_05_01.md` — §47 multi-master BFT (Gnostic / Operative-Masonic / Rosicrucian / Satoshi lineage).
- `memory/feedback_great_data_homecoming_aurora_edge_privacy_runtime_wwjd_canonicalization_temple_template_aaron_2026_05_01.md` — Aurora as edge-privacy runtime; this row's BFT-resistance composes with its edge-enforcement guarantees.
- `memory/feedback_lattice_capture_corrective_discipline_external_vocabulary_check_claudeai_warning_2026_05_01.md` — academic review per the corrective.

## Status

**Filed.** P3 (deferred — multi-year, contingent on B-0132 maturing first). Long-horizon target: converts "Aurora is BFT-resistant" from architectural claim to verified theorem.
