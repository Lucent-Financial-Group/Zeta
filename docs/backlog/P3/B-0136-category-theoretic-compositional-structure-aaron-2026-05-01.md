# B-0136 — Category-theoretic compositional structure

**Priority:** P3 (research-grade; cross-cutting; not urgent; pays off when composing substrate-instances across projects).

**Filed:** 2026-05-01.

**Effort:** L (multi-month — categorical formalization).

## What

Identify the substrate's compositional invariants in categorical terms. The substrate has many compositional pieces — claims compose, retractions compose, attribution graphs compose. **Operads** (n-ary operations + their compositions) and **monoidal categories** (parallel composition) are the relevant frameworks.

**References:**

- Bartosz Milewski, *Category Theory for Programmers* (free, online; written for engineers).
- *Categories for the Working Mathematician* (Mac Lane) — depth.
- Fong & Spivak, *Seven Sketches in Compositionality* (free) — application-oriented.

## Acceptance criteria

1. **Substrate compositional invariants** named in categorical terms (the razor as a functor; orthogonality as a coproduct property; etc.).
2. **At least one categorical theorem** about substrate composition stated and proved.
3. **Cross-project applicability** demonstrated — the categorical framing should compose with the Frontier / Factory / Peers split (per `project_repo_split_provisional_names_frontier_factory_and_peers_2026_04_23.md`).

## Composes with

- B-0131 + B-0133 + B-0134 — categorical framing unifies the formalization-roadmap items.
- *Project: Frontier / Factory / Peers split* — categorical framing supports cross-instance composition.

## Status

**Filed.** P3 (deferred — not urgent; pays off when other formalization items mature).
