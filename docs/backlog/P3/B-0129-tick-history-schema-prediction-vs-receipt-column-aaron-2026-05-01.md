# B-0129 — Tick-history shard schema: prediction-vs-receipt column distinction

**Filed:** 2026-05-01

**Filed by:** Otto under delegated backlog authority. Aaron's framing 2026-05-01: *"having a spot for prediction is not bad as long as it's clear it's prediction"* — validates option (c) from the prefab-shard structural matrix in `memory/feedback_tick_history_prefabricated_shards_codex_finding_audit_trail_integrity_2026_04_30.md`.

**Effort:** S (a few hours — schema doc update + migration of one or two example shards + lint update).

## What

Tick-history shard schema currently has col1 = "tick time" with implicit-receipt semantics (the row exists because the tick fired). The 2026-04-30 prefab finding (per the parent memory file) surfaced 14+ shards where col1 was authored ahead of the cron firing — *predictions* of tick-time, not *receipts*.

Aaron's prediction-OK framing makes option (c) the right direction:

- **Add a column** that distinguishes *prediction-time* from *receipt-time*, OR
- **Add a marker convention** in col1 (e.g., `*` suffix for prediction) that makes the distinction visible to readers without breaking the existing schema.

Both forms preserve the integrity invariant ("a shard claim must be honest about its evidence type") while accepting that predictions ARE legitimate substrate when explicitly labeled.

## Load-bearing benefit: the prediction column IS world-model verification

Aaron 2026-05-01 follow-up: *"that can also see how your internal view of the world your internal world model matches reality in this case, that's good for world model verfication"* — the prediction column itself becomes a calibration mechanism. When a shard records *predicted-tick-time* alongside *actual-receipt-time*, the discrepancy between the two IS the world-model error signal at the substrate layer. Same pattern as the periodic re-audit during honest-wait (per `memory/feedback_manufactured_patience_vs_real_dependency_wait_otto_distinction_2026_04_26.md` — see "Refinement: periodic re-audit during sustained honest-wait" + "Second dimension: periodic re-audit as world-model verification" sections), just operating on a different layer.

**Two instances of the same world-model-verification pattern:**

| Layer | Prediction | Actual | Discrepancy meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cognitive (periodic re-audit) | Actor's classification of in-flight items as Aaron-blocked | What re-audit reveals as actor-actionable | Drift in scope-classification |
| Substrate (this row) | Predicted tick-time recorded in shard col1 | Actual cron-firing time | Drift in cadence-prediction |

Both are world-model-verification via discrepancy detection. Both surface drift that would otherwise be invisible.

**This means option (c) isn't just "honest labeling" — it's a calibration instrument.** The prediction column generates audit trail for the factory's model of its own cadence. Fixed-point thinking applies (per CSAP `memory/feedback_carved_sentence_fixed_point_stability_soul_executor_bayesian_inference_aaron_2026_04_30.md`): the closer prediction-time matches receipt-time consistently, the more the cadence-model has converged to a stable fixed-point.

## Why P3 not P0/P1/P2

- **Low stakes per Aaron 2026-05-01**: *"at this point if history is not perfect it's okay clean it up if you like, if not just note it somewhere and lets do it right in the future, still low steakes, up to you greenfield."*
- **Greenfield framing applies**: not breaking real audit dependencies; the 14 prefab shards from 2026-04-29 are bounded historical artifacts, not a recurring class.
- **Forward-going prevention is the higher-value piece**: the schema improvement matters for FUTURE shards more than for cleaning up past ones.
- **Cadence-cost vs return**: low — readers of tick-history aren't being misled in load-bearing ways today.

## Acceptance criteria

1. **Schema doc updated** — `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/README.md` (the canonical schema doc) explicitly distinguishes prediction-time vs receipt-time columns / markers.
2. **Migration policy documented** — what to do with the 14 existing prefab shards from 2026-04-29 (label retroactively / leave as-is / close the prediction-only ones; whichever Aaron prefers when this lands).
3. **Lint update (optional)** — if a tick-history validator exists, extend it to detect the distinction.

## Out of scope

- **Cleaning up the 14 existing prefab shards**: leave them as-is per Aaron's "low stakes / up to me" framing; this row is forward-going prevention, not retroactive cleanup.
- **Any change to tick-history substrate format beyond the prediction-vs-receipt distinction**.

## Composes with

- `memory/feedback_tick_history_prefabricated_shards_codex_finding_audit_trail_integrity_2026_04_30.md` — the parent finding. Option (c) from that file's matrix.

**Forward-references not yet on `main`** (will be re-added as direct refs once their PRs land):

- `memory/feedback_class_level_rules_need_orthogonality_check_extend_or_create_aaron_2026_05_01.md` — meta-meta-meta-rule. The schema improvement extends the existing tick-history class with a sub-distinction; doesn't create a new class. **Filed in the in-flight PR #1025**.

## Status

**Filed.** No active incident requires this; activate when Aaron picks up the schema work or a future-substrate consumer needs the distinction.
