# B-0521 -- Tinygrad UOp rewrite walk + retract mapping

This row was decomposed from B-0202.

## Acceptance criteria

**Read the source + walk one rewrite manually + map to Zeta retract semantics.**

Verifier: a memo (committed under `docs/research/`) walking through one ALU rewrite from `tinygrad/uop/ops.py` plus `tinygrad/codegen/simplify.py` step-by-step, mapping the rewrite to the closest equivalent in Zeta's existing retract semantics.

Pass: the walk is concrete + cites specific line numbers in the tinygrad source.

Fail-falsifier: the walk reveals that PatternMatcher rewrites are NOT referentially transparent in practice (e.g. depend on iteration order, hidden global state, undocumented mutation), invalidating the DST-safe initial answer.
