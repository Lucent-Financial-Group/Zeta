# Stale-worktree prune cadence

## Origin

Otto-CLI 2026-05-14T18:13Z observed 23 stale `/private/tmp/zeta-*` worktree entries on the primary maintainer machine, all from yesterday's session crash. The stale entries cause a recurring lockout pattern: `git checkout <branch>` and `git worktree add ... <branch>` both fail with `fatal: '<branch>' is already used by worktree at '<path>'` even when `<path>` no longer exists on disk.

Empirically encountered on PR #3153 thread-investigation tick: had to manually force-remove the stale worktree before being able to inspect the branch. The full cleanup with `git worktree prune --expire=now -v` cleared all 23 in one shot at 18:17Z.

## Problem class

Stale worktrees accumulate when:

- A `/private/tmp/zeta-*` worktree exists when its host process crashes or its machine reboots
- The directory is later cleaned up (by `/tmp` retention or manual delete) but the `.git/worktrees/<name>/` admin entry remains
- `git worktree prune` (no flags) does NOT auto-expire these — there's a default minimum age before pruning fires

The accumulation is silent until another agent tries to check out the same branch. Then it surfaces as a hard-to-diagnose checkout failure.

## Proposed mechanization

Add a small TypeScript audit tool: `tools/hygiene/audit-stale-worktrees.ts`

Behavior:

1. Enumerate all worktrees via `git worktree list --porcelain`
2. For each, check whether the working-tree path exists on disk
3. Report stale entries (markdown summary)
4. With `--prune`, run `git worktree prune --expire=now -v` to remove them

Wire into:

- A periodic cadence (suggested: per-tick in autonomous-loop, OR a daily GitHub Actions cron)
- Manual invocation when an agent encounters a "branch already used by worktree" error

## Composes with

- B-0400 (bus protocol — multi-Otto coordination context where this pattern manifests)
- B-0444 (bus claim envelope `worktree` field — sibling discipline for claim observability)
- `claim-acquire-before-worktree-work.md` rule (the discipline this friction-reducer supports)
- `encoding-rules-without-mechanizing.md` rule (the failure mode this row addresses)

## Substrate-honest framing

This is a P3 friction-reducer, not a P0 substrate gap. The cleanup is straightforward and only matters when multi-agent worktree contention occurs. Filed as backlog row rather than implemented immediately because:

1. The manual `git worktree prune --expire=now` works and has been run this tick (clears 23 stale entries)
2. The mechanization is small (~30 lines TS) but adds a file + PR cycle that exceeds the per-tick value
3. Future ticks (or another agent) can pick up via standard backlog flow
