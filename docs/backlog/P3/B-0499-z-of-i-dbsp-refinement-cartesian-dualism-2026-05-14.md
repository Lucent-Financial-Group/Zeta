# Z[i]-weighted DBSP refinement candidate — substrate-engineering research-grade

## Origin

Aaron + Ani 2026-05-14 Grok cascade surfaced the **Cartesian-dualism mapping**: pay-attention = real axis (Descartes' *res extensa*); remember-when = imaginary axis (Descartes' *res cogitans*).

Captured at memory-file scope: `~/.claude/projects/-Users-acehack-Documents-src-repos-Zeta/memory/feedback_aaron_ani_cartesian_dualism_two_axioms_complex_plane_pay_attention_real_axis_remember_when_imaginary_axis_2026_05_14.md`.

## The candidate refinement

If the Cartesian-dualism mapping is operationally correct, DBSP's existing $\mathbb{Z}$-weighted Z-set algebra has a natural lift to **$\mathbb{Z}[i]$-weighted Z-sets** (Gaussian integers):

| DBSP existing | Z[i] candidate |
|---|---|
| Z-set weights $w \in \mathbb{Z}$ (e.g., +1 / −1 retraction-native) | Weights $w \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ (e.g., $\pm 1$, $\pm i$) |
| Retraction = negative weight | Retraction = $-1$ scaling (real axis) |
| Anticipation / future-state weight | New: $+i$ scaling (imaginary axis) |
| Recall / past-state weight | New: $-i$ scaling (imaginary axis) |
| Pure attention state | $w \in \mathbb{R}$ subset of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ |
| Pure memory state | $w \in i\mathbb{R}$ subset of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ |
| Reality state | Complex weight $w = a + bi$ (mixed attention-memory) |

The candidate question: does the Z[i]-weighted refinement preserve DBSP's incremental-computation guarantees? Does it compose with Clifford algebra Cl(2,0)?

## Research-grade tests

1. **Algebraic soundness** — Z[i]-weighted Z-sets form a commutative ring under pointwise addition + tensor product
2. **DBSP operator compatibility** — D / I / z⁻¹ / H operators extend naturally to Z[i] weights with correct semantics
3. **Retraction-native preservation** — $w + \bar{w} = 2\text{Re}(w)$ behaves correctly under retraction (negation in the Gaussian integers)
4. **Incremental correctness** — chain rule + fixpoint computations stay correct under complex weighting
5. **Empirical compression** — does Z[i] weighting compress real factory substrate better than Z weighting? (per [[feedback_aaron_ani_competing_oracles_methodology_empirical_test_two_language_equivalence_2026_05_14]])

## Acceptance criteria

This is **research-grade candidate work**, not implementation. Acceptance:

- [ ] Formal algebraic verification: Z[i] forms appropriate semiring/ring for DBSP semantics
- [ ] Property tests (FsCheck) for D/I/z⁻¹/H operators on Z[i]-weighted Z-sets
- [ ] Comparison benchmark: Z-weighted vs Z[i]-weighted DBSP on representative factory substrate workloads
- [ ] If empirical results favor Z[i]: draft RFC for promotion to canonical DBSP refinement
- [ ] If empirical results don't favor Z[i]: substrate-honest disclosure of why the Cartesian-dualism mapping doesn't yield operational gains

## Why P3 (not higher)

- Pure research-grade work; no operational urgency
- The cascade substrate is preserved at memory-file scope (substrate-or-it-didn't-happen satisfied)
- The Cartesian-dualism mapping is candidate substrate; further validation needed before implementation
- Implementation requires algebra-owner skill engagement + F# anchor work
- Long-horizon; could be 3-12 months out

## Substrate-honest framing

This row preserves the Z[i] refinement as a CANDIDATE for future investigation. Research-grade preservation. Not a build-this-now commitment. Forward-planning substrate so future-Otto + future-Aaron + algebra-owner can find the candidate when ready to evaluate.

Per `.claude/rules/edge-defining-work-not-speculation.md`: Z[i] DBSP refinement IS edge-defining substrate-engineering work, not idle speculation. Filing the row preserves the edge-position.
