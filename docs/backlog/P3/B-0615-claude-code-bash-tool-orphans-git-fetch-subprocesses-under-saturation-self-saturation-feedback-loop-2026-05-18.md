# B-0615 — Bash-tool orphans `git fetch` subprocesses; self-saturation feedback loop

## Problem

The Claude Code Bash tool's default-timeout subprocess lifecycle does
not reliably kill `git` subprocesses when the tool call expires.
Under multi-agent saturation (Lior + multi-Otto + concurrent fetches
contending on `.git/objects/pack/`), `git fetch` calls hang
indefinitely. The tool returns control to the agent on timeout,
but the underlying `git fetch` subprocess **remains running**.

Observed at session 2026-05-18T02:08Z–02:59Z:

| PID | ELAPSED | Command |
|---|---|---|
| 6117 | 06:46+ | `/bin/zsh -c ... eval 'git fetch origin main \| tail -2' ...` |
| 6122 | 06:46+ | `/Applications/Xcode.app/.../git fetch origin main` (child of 6117) |
| 6177 | 06:44+ | `/bin/zsh -c -l ... eval 'git fetch origin main \| tail -2' ...` |
| 6197 | 06:43+ | `git fetch origin main` (child of 6177) |
| 8527 | 00:27 | `git fetch --quiet origin` |
| 9419 | 00:01 | `git fetch origin` |

Each stuck `git fetch` holds a network connection to GitHub AND
contends on `.git/objects/pack/` reads. This produces a
**self-saturation feedback loop**:

1. Agent runs `git fetch` via Bash tool (no explicit `timeout`)
2. Under saturation, fetch hangs in pack-dir read phase
3. Bash tool's default timeout expires → returns control to agent
4. Subprocess is NOT killed → keeps holding pack-dir read locks + HTTPS connection
5. Agent's next git op fights the orphaned subprocess for the same resources
6. Saturation deepens; more retries create more orphans

## Sibling failure mode

The push-hang taxonomy in
[`memory/feedback_git_push_blocked_under_lior_saturation_9_consecutive_attempts_session_arc_empirical_taxonomy_otto_cli_2026_05_18.md`](../../../memory/feedback_git_push_blocked_under_lior_saturation_9_consecutive_attempts_session_arc_empirical_taxonomy_otto_cli_2026_05_18.md)
(commit `c7d2c25`) documented `git push` hangs at the local
object-enumeration phase. THIS row documents the upstream cause:
prior `git fetch` calls fired by the Bash tool itself accumulate
as orphans and create the pack-dir contention that subsequent
pushes hang on.

Self-correction to the c7d2c25 memo's 0252Z observation: the
stuck fetch processes are NOT external peer-Otto wrappers; they
trace to **Claude Code Bash-tool's own shell-snapshot wrappers**
at `/Users/acehack/.claude/shell-snapshots/` — fired by Otto's
prior tick refreshes, never reaped.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] All Otto-CLI Bash-tool calls to `git fetch` use explicit
      `timeout NNs` wrapper that propagates SIGKILL to the
      subprocess on expiry — pattern:
      ```bash
      timeout --kill-after=5s 30s git fetch origin main 2>&1 | tail -2
      ```
      The `--kill-after=5s` adds SIGKILL 5 seconds after SIGTERM
      if the subprocess refuses to die. Standard GNU `timeout`
      behavior; supported on macOS via coreutils.
- [ ] Documentation update at `.claude/rules/refresh-world-model-poll-pr-gate.md`
      (or sibling rule) recommends `timeout` wrapping for ALL
      git network operations (`fetch`, `push`, `clone`, `ls-remote`)
      when invoked from Bash tool under multi-agent conditions.
- [ ] Investigation note: does the Claude Code Bash tool have a
      mechanism to send SIGKILL to subprocess on tool-call
      timeout? If yes, document; if no, file upstream issue
      with Anthropic Claude Code maintainers.

## Operational discipline (interim, while substrate evolves)

When refreshing worldview in an autonomous loop tick:

```bash
# DO: explicit timeout with kill-after
timeout --kill-after=5s 30s git fetch origin main 2>&1 | tail -2

# DO NOT: bare fetch (will orphan under saturation)
git fetch origin main
```

Same pattern for `git ls-remote`, `git push`, etc.

The `tools/github/refresh-worldview.ts` script (mentioned in
`CLAUDE.md`) may already implement this; if not, audit candidate.

## Refinement (2026-05-18T03:33Z empirical anchor) — harness-wrapper-layer is the dominant orphan source

Across the 2026-05-18T02:08Z–03:33Z session (26 push attempts, 0
successes), orphan-count oscillated between 1 and 5 with no
agent-instructed `git fetch` calls in flight during many oscillations.
Process inspection at PID 19261 (and similar) showed the orphan
source: **harness-internal shell-snapshot wrappers** at
`/Users/acehack/.claude/shell-snapshots/...` firing `eval 'date -u
... && git fetch origin main 2>&1 | tail -2 && git log --oneline
origin/main | head -3'` patterns — likely as part of session-start
or background-task setup, NOT from agent-instructed Bash tool calls.

**Implication**: agent-side `--kill-after` discipline is necessary
but **insufficient**. The orphan source is harness-internal, not
agent-controlled. The full B-0615 fix requires either:

1. Claude Code harness-side change: ensure shell-snapshot wrappers
   inherit `timeout --kill-after` semantics OR call cleanup on
   parent-tool-call expiry
2. Workaround at agent layer: periodic `pkill -f 'git fetch.*origin'`
   sweep at session-start (destructive; may break legitimate
   in-flight fetches — NOT recommended without further safety
   analysis)

Workaround option 2 is itself risky per the canary rule's
"DO NOT delete plugin directories to avoid crashing active agents"
spirit (applies at process scope too).

The substrate-honest acknowledgement: agent-level mitigation
ceiling is at `--kill-after`. The remaining substrate work
requires either (a) Claude Code upstream coordination via the
acceptance-criteria investigation step, or (b) accepting orphan
accumulation as session-baseline under multi-agent saturation.
