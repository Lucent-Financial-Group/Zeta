# B-0951 — Ace setup-manifest realizers (deferred)

## Operator framing (Aaron 2026-06-21)

> *"just backlog the ace stuff we need to get what we have clean first and stop
> scripts like quantum and elan and all the others that are not mechanism based
> like before first."*

The Ace declarative desired-state trajectory (B-0854, B-0288) stays **backlogged**.
Do **not** pursue Bun/Ace realizer swaps or Ace package pointer expansion for setup
manifests until:

1. **B-0950** landed (#8920) — non-mechanism `common/*.sh` realizers folded into
   `tools/setup/mechanisms/*` + manifests; Ace mechanism pointers cover the full graph.
2. **CI is clean** on steward-mechanical work — gate green on mechanism consolidation merge.

## What was explored and parked

During PR #8920 steward work we mapped setup scripts to Ace conversion tiers. Conclusion:
most manifests are **already declarative**; the gap is inconsistent **realizer shape**
(one-off bash per ecosystem), not missing Ace packages. Examples already partially wired:

- `tools/setup/ace-mechanism-pointers.json` + `setup-mechanism-pointers.ts` (mechanisms)
- `src/Core.TypeScript/ace/packages/qsharp-reference-oracle-0.1.0.json` (quantum manifest)

**Parked until B-0950:** emit Ace pointers for `uv-tools`, `dotnet-tools`, `agent-clis`,
etc.; add Bun realizers under `src/Core.TypeScript/ace/`; shrink `linux.sh` to
`ace-realize`. That is Phase 2+ of B-0854, not the current critical path.

## Acceptance (when this row re-opens)

1. B-0950 complete — no orphan `common/*.sh` manifest realizers outside the mechanism
   tree (except documented bootstrap edges: `mise.sh`, `install.sh` routing, `keyring.sh`).
2. `check-bash-retirement-inventory.ts` allowlist reflects the shrunk surface.
3. Ace pointer generation extends to all mechanism manifests without duplicating manifest
   text (single source of truth in `tools/setup/manifests/*`).
4. Bun realizers run **post-mise** only; `install.sh` bootstrap edge unchanged until
   B-0854 Phase 3.

## Why P3

Correct long-horizon direction; wrong sequencing relative to substrate hygiene. Mechanism
consolidation first removes accidental complexity; Ace realizers second inherit a uniform
graph.
