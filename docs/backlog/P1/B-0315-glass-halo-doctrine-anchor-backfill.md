# Glass-Halo doctrine external-anchor backfill

Research and land external prior-art anchors for Glass-Halo
doctrines visible on public-facing surfaces (README.md,
AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, docs/ALIGNMENT.md).

## Target doctrines

| Doctrine | Public surface | Core property |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Radical honesty | AGENTS.md, ALIGNMENT.md | AI never hides reasoning from observers |
| Total observability | AGENTS.md, ALIGNMENT.md | Every decision trail is inspectable |
| No hidden reasoning | AGENTS.md | Visible chain of thought, not opaque |
| Glass-halo transparency | CLAUDE.md, README.md | External-facing truthfulness contract |
| Retraction-native | AGENTS.md | Every action has a bounded undo path |

## Research approach per doctrine

1. Extract the doctrine's operational definition from
   AGENTS.md / ALIGNMENT.md.
2. WebSearch for the underlying concept in AI transparency
   research, explainable AI (XAI), organizational
   transparency theory, software auditability literature.
3. Cite or note "original to Zeta" per the B-0060 protocol.
4. Land anchors inline in the doctrine's defining surface.

## Done-criteria

- [ ] All Glass-Halo doctrines have external anchor or
      "original" note.
- [ ] Citations include URL, author/org, title, date.
- [ ] Beacon-safety pass on all cited sources.
- [ ] Coverage scanner (B-0311) confirms resolution.

## Pre-start checklist (2026-05-10, slice 1)

### Prior-art search

Axes searched: XAI/interpretable-ML literature, organizational radical-
transparency theory, AI audit-trail / accountability research, CoT
monitorability safety research.

Queries run (2026-05-10):

- "radical transparency organizational theory Dalio AI systems accountability"
- "algorithmic transparency explainability AI decision audit trail XAI"
- "LLM chain-of-thought reasoning transparency no hidden reasoning AI observability"
- "Brundage 2020 toward trustworthy AI development mechanisms verifiable claims"
- "Doshi-Velez Kim 2017 rigorous science interpretable machine learning"
- "bilateral transparency symmetric transparency mutual transparency human-AI"
- "Korbak chain of thought monitorability fragile opportunity AI safety arxiv"

Results:

- Dalio (2017) *Principles: Life and Work* → radical transparency / no hidden moves
- Doshi-Velez & Kim (2017) arxiv:1702.08608 → total observability / inspectable decisions
- Brundage et al. (2020) arxiv:2004.07213 → audit trails / total observability
- Korbak et al. (2025) arxiv:2507.11473 → CoT monitorability / no hidden reasoning
- Bilateral symmetric form: no external prior art found → original to Zeta

### Dependency check

- B-0311 (external-anchor coverage scanner): **closed** ✓
- B-0060 (parent umbrella): umbrella, no gate ✓
- No broken `depends_on` pointers in this row.

### Scope for slice 1

This slice lands anchors for three of the five doctrines
(radical honesty, total observability, no hidden reasoning)
in their ALIGNMENT.md surface only — specifically the
"Symmetric transparency: the glass halo" section.

Remaining for subsequent slices:

- Glass-halo transparency in CLAUDE.md / README.md
- Retraction-native in AGENTS.md
- Radical honesty / total observability / no hidden reasoning in AGENTS.md

### Scope for slice 2 (2026-05-10)

Lands prior-art block for three AGENTS.md doctrines (radical honesty,
total observability, no hidden reasoning) at their defining location —
AGENTS.md §"The three load-bearing values". Single blockquote citing:

- Dalio (2017) → radical honesty / truth over politeness
- Brundage et al. (2020) arxiv:2004.07213 → total observability / git audit trail
- Korbak et al. (2025) arxiv:2507.11473 → no hidden reasoning / reviewer layer

Remaining after slice 2:

- Glass-halo transparency in CLAUDE.md / README.md
- Retraction-native in AGENTS.md

### Scope for slice 3 (2026-05-10)

Lands two remaining doctrines:

1. **Retraction-native in AGENTS.md** — bullet added to §"How AI agents
   should treat this codebase", citing Richardson (2016+) Saga Pattern
   and Microsoft Azure Compensating Transaction pattern as prior art;
   git-native retraction noted as original to Zeta.

2. **Glass-halo transparency in README.md** — acknowledgements paragraph
   added noting the bilateral / symmetric form as original to Zeta,
   linking to `docs/ALIGNMENT.md` §"Symmetric transparency: the glass halo".
   CLAUDE.md omitted: currently razor-trimmed to 47-line bootstrap;
   adding doctrine content contradicts the B-0353 condensation intent.

All five B-0315 doctrines now have external anchor or "original" note
on at least one defining surface. Core done-criteria met; the coverage
scanner remains deferred to the next audit pass:

- [x] All Glass-Halo doctrines have external anchor or "original" note
- [x] Citations include URL, author/org, title, date
- [x] Beacon-safety pass: all cited sources (Dalio, Doshi-Velez/Kim,
      Brundage et al., Korbak et al., Richardson Saga, MS Azure) are
      reputable academic/industry publications
- [ ] Coverage scanner (B-0311, closed) — deferred to next audit pass
