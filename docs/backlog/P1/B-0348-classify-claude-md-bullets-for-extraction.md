# B-0348 — Classify all CLAUDE.md bullets into extraction tiers

## What

Audit every bullet in CLAUDE.md's "Ground rules Claude Code
honours here" section (currently 51 bold-bullet rules across
~900 lines) and classify each into exactly one extraction tier:

| Tier | Meaning | Destination |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `stay` | Essential at wake — part of the bootstrap process | Stays in CLAUDE.md (condensed to 1-2 lines) |
| `extract` | Behavioral rule — auto-loads from `.claude/rules/` | New `.claude/rules/<name>.md` file; CLAUDE.md bullet becomes pointer |
| `already` | Already extracted to `.claude/rules/` | CLAUDE.md bullet stays as pointer (no work needed) |
| `redundant` | Already covered by AGENTS.md / GOVERNANCE.md / docs/ | Remove from CLAUDE.md |

## Why

Every subsequent B-0329 child depends on this classification
to know which bullets to touch. Without it, extraction batches
risk moving the wrong content or duplicating what's already
covered elsewhere.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Classification table added to this row (or a linked doc)
   listing all 51 bullets with their tier assignment.
2. Each `extract` bullet assigned to exactly one of the four
   extraction batches (B-0349..B-0352) by functional group.
3. Each `redundant` bullet paired with the existing doc that
   already covers it.
4. No code/substrate changes — analysis only.

### Section: "What Claude won't find here" (4 bullets)

| # | Bullet | Tier | Rationale |
| - | ------ | ---- | --------- |
| 48 | Runnable slash commands | `stay` | Pointer |
| 49 | CI workflow files | `stay` | Pointer |
| 50 | Any archive / change-history directory | `stay` | Pointer |
| 51 | Rules do not live in this file | `stay` | Meta-pointer |

### Summary

| Tier | Count | Action |
| ---- | ----- | ------ |
| `stay` | 18 | Condense to 1-2 lines each |
| `extract` | 21 | Move to `.claude/rules/<name>.md` |
| `already` | 6 | Already extracted — keep pointers |
| `redundant` | 4 | Remove (covered elsewhere) |
| **Total** | **49** | (2 sub-bullets counted separately) |

### Extraction batch assignments

| Batch | Bullets | Theme |
| ----- | ------- | ----- |
