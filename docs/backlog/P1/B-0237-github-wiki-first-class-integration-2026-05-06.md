# B-0237 - GitHub Wiki first-class integration

Split the GitHub Wiki lane from the Pages lane so Pages can
ship first and Wiki can become a deliberate second surface.

## Work scope

This row owns Wiki seeding, repo-to-wiki sync strategy,
Pages-vs-Wiki division of responsibility, indexing
preconditions, and the Karpathy-style human-facing rendering
of internal markdown substrate.

## Acceptance criteria

- Initial Wiki pages are named and sourced.
- The integration mode is selected: repo-source-to-wiki or
  wiki-canonical-with-repo snapshot.
- Pages and Wiki content boundaries are explicit.
- Wiki indexing preconditions are verified before SEO success
  is attributed to Wiki.
