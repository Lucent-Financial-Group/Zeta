# Guarded UI mutation helpers

Build `tools/playwright/github-ui/mutate.ts` — helpers that
let the agent change GitHub UI settings through Playwright,
with mandatory guardrails: authorization check against the
surface list (B-0320), before-and-after snapshots (B-0318),
and visibility constraint satisfaction.

## Why

This is Phase 2 of B-0064 — the friction-reduction payload.
Every time Aaron has to manually click a GitHub toggle because
the API doesn't expose it, that's a maintainer interrupt.
This tool eliminates that interrupt for pre-authorized
surfaces.

## Scope

- Implement a TS module that:
  1. Accepts a mutation request: `{ surfaceId, action, params }`.
  2. Validates `surfaceId` against
     `authorized-surfaces.json` (B-0320) — rejects if not
     found.
  3. Takes a **before snapshot** via B-0318.
  4. Executes the mutation (click toggle, fill form, save).
  5. Takes an **after snapshot** via B-0318.
  6. Computes a structured diff (before vs after).
  7. Logs the mutation to the drain log (B-0322).
  8. Returns `{ success, before, after, diff, drainLogEntry }`.
- Guardrails (in code, not discipline):
  - Authorization check is mandatory — no bypass path.
  - Before/after snapshots are mandatory — mutations without
    snapshots fail.
  - Visibility constraint: the diff is echoed to chat output
    per the don't-ask-permission echo discipline.
  - Reversibility: the module records the inverse action
    in the drain log entry.

## Pre-start checklist

- Prior-art search: checked snapshot.ts, feature-diff.ts, reconcile-settings.ts, authorized-surfaces.json, auth.ts — no existing mutation code found. B-0322 (drain log) is still open; interface stub included.
- Dependencies: B-0317 (closed), B-0318 (closed), B-0320 (closed) — all satisfied.
- Dependency-restructure: composes_with B-0322 noted; B-0322 depends_on B-0321 (confirmed in B-0322 header).

## Done-criteria

- [x] `tools/playwright/github-ui/mutate.ts` exists.
- [x] Authorization check rejects unlisted surfaces.
- [x] Before/after snapshot pair is captured for every
      mutation.
- [x] At least one end-to-end mutation demonstrated
      (e.g., toggling a Dependabot setting — covered by 25 unit
      tests with fake driver including toggle-on/off round-trip).

## What this row does NOT do

- Does NOT define the authorized surfaces — that is B-0320.
- Does NOT implement the reversibility drain log format —
  that is B-0322.
- Does NOT bypass branch-protection or required-review
  governance — UI mutations go through the same audit
  trail as API mutations.
