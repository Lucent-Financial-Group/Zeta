# B-0333 — Memory-retire/supersession discipline

## Parent

B-0190 Step 5 (memory-retire / dead-code-deletion discipline).

## What

Define and document the discipline for when a memory file is
superseded:

1. **When to supersede** — a newer memory file covers the same
   ground with updated/corrected content.
2. **Mechanism** — options: (a) delete the old file (git history
   preserves it), (b) add `superseded_by:` frontmatter field
   pointing to the replacement, (c) merge content into the
   replacement and delete.
3. **MEMORY.md index update** — the superseded file's index
   entry is removed or replaced.
4. **Cross-reference repair** — any file citing the superseded
   file gets its reference updated.

## Why depends on B-0332

The load-bearing-vs-decorative classification determines
which files are safe to retire without breaking the bootstrap
chain. Retiring a load-bearing file without updating its
citation in CLAUDE.md is a wake-time regression.

## Output

A discipline section added to `memory/README.md` (the canonical
memory policy surface).

## Acceptance criteria

1. Supersession discipline documented in `memory/README.md`.
2. Discipline covers all four areas above.
3. At least 3 currently-superseded files identified and processed
   per the new discipline as a smoke check.

## Why S effort

Policy definition + small demonstration. Bulk cleanup is a
separate follow-up.
