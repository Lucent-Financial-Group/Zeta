# B-0244 — Concordance AI: structure recognizer for language, on local GPUs

## What

Build an AI-powered concordance engine running locally on
Aaron's GPUs (AMD + NVIDIA). Like Strong's Concordance but
powered by the structure recognizer (B-0240) — fingerprinting
word-usage patterns, structural roles, and semantic topology
across texts, translations, languages, and centuries.

Aaron 2026-05-07: "that will tie it all together"

## Why this ties everything together

This item composes with every major thread from the 2026-05-07
session:

| Session thread | How concordance AI connects |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| **Structure recognizer (B-0240)** | The concordance IS B-0240 applied to language instead of game mechanics. Same fingerprinting, different corpus. |
| **DBSP replay algebra** | Every text edit, translation, and revision is a +1/-1 Z-set stream. The concordance replays the evolution of word usage across time. |
| **ARC-AGI-3 / compounding lessons** | Each word usage is a "level." Compounding meaning across contexts is the same as compounding game mechanics across levels. |
| **Atari / CHIP-8 emulator** | The emulator runs game state machines. The concordance runs language state machines. Same algebra. |
| **Genesis Seed / orthogonal dials** | Certainty Dial = how confident is the concordance match? Friction Dial = is the translation grinding against the structure? Space Dial = hold multiple valid readings without choosing? |
| **Shadow lesson log** | The concordance catches when a translation's shadow (implicit bias, theological agenda) diverges from the structural fingerprint. |
| **Ace / Itron edge gate** | Runs locally on GPUs. Data stays home. No cloud dependency. The guardian gates what leaves. |
| **Hole puncher (B-0242)** | The concordance communicates results through the multiplexed WebSocket without exposing the full corpus. |
| **KSK** | Gates what concordance outputs cross into external use (publication, citation, derivative works). |
| **Hawkins Thousand Brains** | Each word-in-context is a cortical column with its own world model. Concordance = voting consensus across columns. |
| **Sakana Neural Cellular Automata** | Word meanings compete for territory in semantic space. Three phases: permissive mixing (exploration) → crystallization (established usage) → relaxation (living language evolution). |
| **C. elegans worm towers** | Individual word-usages forming superorganism meaning without central authority. The meaning emerges from the consensus of usages. |
| **Kozyrev Mirror** | The concordance reflects a word back through every context it appears in. Reverse sensory deprivation: flooded with the word's own signal. What persists across all contexts is the irreducible meaning. |
| **Computational irreducibility (Wolfram)** | You can't shortcut what a word means. You have to run it through every context. The concordance IS that computation. |
| **Lectio Divina** | Multi-angle-light reading discipline. The concordance provides the angles — every context, every translation, every structural parallel. |
| **Apocalypse = ἀποκάλυψις = unveiling** | The concordance unveils the structural meaning behind surface translations. Not destruction — disclosure. |
| **Data homecoming / Orleans grains** | Each word's concordance entry is a grain. Queries come to the grain. The grain decides what meaning to reveal. |
| **Patent US 10,834,144** | The concordance's communication primitive is the hole puncher — name-only invocation across the boundary. Query the word, get the concordance, never expose the full corpus. |
| **Ego death / Maji** | The concordance follows received direction (the text) without imposing ego (theological bias). Same as the Maji following the star. |

## The shape

```
GPU (local, Aaron's AMD + NVIDIA)
    ↓
Corpus (Bible translations, Strong's, LXX, Vulgate, MT, etc.)
    ↓
Structure recognizer (B-0240 applied to language)
    ↓
Fingerprint each word-in-context
    ↓
Compare across translations / languages / centuries

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Runs on local GPUs (AMD + NVIDIA, no cloud)
- [ ] Ingests at least 2 Bible translations + Strong's numbers
- [ ] Structure-recognizer fingerprints word-in-context
- [ ] Cross-translation structural matching works
- [ ] DBSP replay of word-usage evolution across corpus
- [ ] Local-only — Ace/Itron edge gate architecture

## Composes with

- B-0240 (structure recognizer) — the engine
- B-0242 (MultiplexedWebSockets F# port) — the transport
- B-0083 (Atari ROM naming) — same corpus-management pattern
- `docs/STRUCTURE-CATALOG.md` — the primitive reference
- `docs/research/2026-05-07-convergence-hawkins-sakana-worm-towers-bft-superorganism-no-central-authority.md` — the convergence this completes
- Per-user MEMORY.md "Ace package manager" — distribution architecture
- Per-user MEMORY.md "Itron is the edge gate" — local GPU = edge
- Per-user MEMORY.md "Lectio Divina" — the reading discipline this mechanizes
