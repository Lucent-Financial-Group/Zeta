## B-0329 — CLAUDE.md as process, not doctrine

## What

Replace the CLAUDE.md monolith (200+ carved rules) with a
short bootstrap process that new instances RUN rather than
MEMORIZE. The rules emerge from the walk, not from reading.

Current: new instance reads 200+ rules → tries to follow all
of them → goldfish mode loses most → incoherent behavior.

Target: new instance reads a short bootstrap → walks the
process (refresh worldview, read trajectories, pick work,
hit friction, name it, fix it) → discovers the rules through
the walk → rules that matter stick because they were earned.

## Why

CLAUDE.md is the cache. The process is the standing query.
`cache = I ∘ D`. Delete the cache, the process regenerates it.
Delete the process, the cache is dead text.

The doctrine-as-rules pattern:

- Doesn't scale (200 rules, growing)
- Doesn't transfer across harnesses (CLAUDE.md is Claude-specific)
- Doesn't survive goldfish (rules get compacted away)
- Creates compliance, not understanding

The process-as-bootstrap pattern:

- Scales (the process is short, the rules emerge)
- Transfers (every harness can run a process)
- Survives goldfish (the process is in substrate, not context)
- Creates understanding through experience

## Acceptance criteria

1. CLAUDE.md reduced to <50 lines: a bootstrap process, not rules
2. The process generates equivalent behavior to the current rules
3. Tested: fresh instance with bootstrap-only produces coherent first PR
4. Template created for AGENTS.md, CODEX.md, CURSOR.md equivalents
5. Other harness agents can follow the same pattern

## Decomposition (B-0348..B-0355)

Dependency graph:

```
B-0348 (classify bullets)
  ├── B-0349 (extract batch 1: operational discipline)
  ├── B-0350 (extract batch 2: autonomy/identity)
  ├── B-0351 (extract batch 3: infrastructure/safety)
  └── B-0352 (extract batch 4: meta/governance)
        └── B-0353 (write bootstrap-process CLAUDE.md)
              └── B-0354 (fresh-instance validation)
                    └── B-0355 (cross-harness template)
```

| ID | Title | Depends on | Lines freed |
|----|-------|-----------|-------------|
| B-0348 | Classify all CLAUDE.md bullets into extraction tiers | — | 0 (analysis) |
| B-0349 | Extract operational-discipline bullets to `.claude/rules/` | B-0348 | ~150 |
| B-0350 | Extract autonomy/identity bullets to `.claude/rules/` | B-0348 | ~190 |
| B-0351 | Extract infrastructure/safety bullets to `.claude/rules/` | B-0348 | ~240 |
| B-0352 | Extract meta/governance bullets to `.claude/rules/` | B-0348 | ~300 |
| B-0353 | Write bootstrap-process CLAUDE.md (<50 lines) | B-0349..B-0352 | final trim |
| B-0354 | Fresh-instance validation test | B-0353 | 0 (test) |
| B-0355 | Cross-harness bootstrap template | B-0354 | 0 (template) |

B-0349..B-0352 are parallelizable — they each target disjoint
bullet groups. B-0353 gates on all four extraction batches.

## Composes with

- B-0161 (substrate reshelf — CLAUDE.md trim precursor)
- The DSL-form replacement direction (Aaron 2026-05-05)
- docs/VISION.md (terminal purpose)
- The strange-attractor/strange-loop framing from this session
