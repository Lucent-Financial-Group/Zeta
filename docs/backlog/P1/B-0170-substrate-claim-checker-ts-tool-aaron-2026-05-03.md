# Substrate-claim-checker TS tool — mechanize the verify-then-claim discipline

The verify-then-claim discipline (`memory/feedback_verify_then_claim_discipline_dominant_failure_mode_substrate_authoring_otto_2026_05_03.md`) catalogues N distinct claim-vs-reality drift instances across 9+ PRs in a single session. Manual discipline keeps failing at the same rate even after the discipline is named, sub-classes catalogued, and recursive corrections applied. The substrate-claim-checker TS tool is the mechanization path.

## Why P1

- N instances of substrate-authoring failure in one session, of which 9+ landed AFTER the discipline was named — empirical urgency
- Each drift instance costs ~10-30 minutes of follow-up work; the catalogued instances (see verify-then-claim memo's body table) compound to many hours of agent-time wasted on drift fixing
- The pattern is self-evidencing: each tick produces new drift, even when the drift catalogue itself is being authored
- Mechanization is the only path; manual discipline provably insufficient

## V0 already shipped (this PR)

`tools/substrate-claim-checker/check-counts.ts` covers one sub-class:

- **Count drift** — body says "N drift instances" / "N rows" / "N items" but the actual count differs

V0 limitations documented in `tools/substrate-claim-checker/README.md`:

- Nearest-table heuristic (no noun-to-table matching yet)
- Rhetorical number false positives (`"100 rows"` in narrative)
- Markdown-table data rows only (lists not counted yet)

## Remaining sub-classes for v1+

Per the verify-then-claim catalogue:

| Sub-class | v0? | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Count drift | ✓ shipped | "N rows / instances / items" vs actual count |
| Existence drift | ✓ shipped | "file/dir/tool exists" claim vs `ls` / `test -e` |
| Semantic-equivalence drift | v0.9 | command substitution equivalence claims |
| Empirical-output drift | v0.9 | "command returns X" vs actual output |
| Convention drift | v0.9 | recommended pattern matches canonical convention |
| Path-form drift | ✓ shipped | fully-qualified vs bare paths consistent across document |
| Self-recursive drift | v0.9 | the memo about X contains its own X |
| Cross-surface count drift (frontmatter ↔ body ↔ section heading ↔ carved sentence ↔ MEMORY.md) | ✓ shipped (v0.8 — frontmatter description vs body table; full cross-surface v0.9) | five surfaces should match consistent N |

## Hooks integration (planned, not v0)

Per the verify-then-claim memo:

- **pre-commit** hook: validate staged-file content
- **commit-msg** hook: validate the commit message itself (fires AFTER message exists; pre-commit can't see it)
- **CI check**: validate PR descriptions on host

These land in subsequent PRs once check-types are mature.

## Done-criteria

This row closes when:

1. All 7 sub-classes from the verify-then-claim catalogue have at least one check-type in `tools/substrate-claim-checker/`
2. Pre-commit + commit-msg hooks are wired (with documented opt-out for legitimate edge cases)
3. CI check for PR descriptions is wired
4. The tool's eval-set (the N historical drift instances) has corresponding fixture-tests
5. Self-test: the tool runs against `memory/` and `docs/research/` regularly without false-positive flood

## Composes with

- **B-0169** (decision-archaeology skill) — same author per Aaron 2026-05-03 *"skills are carved sentences ... knowledge is in docs and can be referred to by skills, skills don't need updating as much"*; substrate-claim-checker is a tooling-class hub that the eventual decision-archaeology SKILL.md will call
- `memory/feedback_verify_then_claim_discipline_dominant_failure_mode_substrate_authoring_otto_2026_05_03.md` — the discipline this tool mechanizes
- `memory/feedback_skills_as_carved_sentences_knowledge_in_docs_datavault_2_0_pattern_aaron_2026_05_03.md` — rule 2 (no dynamic commands in skills; use TS files); this tool IS one of the TS files
- `memory/feedback_prefer_ts_scripts_over_dynamic_bash_for_conversation_ux_dst_in_ts_aaron_2026_05_01.md` — TS-script preference; same shape
- `memory/feedback_rule_number_one_assume_its_already_done_and_you_just_have_to_find_it_remember_forever_and_into_all_future_generations_aaron_2026_05_05.md` — Rule #1 default-posture; substrate-claim-checker mechanizes the verify step that Rule #1 asks for ("assume it's done, then find it") at the substrate-claim layer.
- `memory/feedback_rule_number_four_assume_another_human_on_the_internet_already_solved_it_since_your_training_data_find_it_via_websearch_aaron_2026_05_05.md` — Rule #4 (search-first authority via WebSearch) is the upstream-of-substrate verify discipline; this tool mechanizes the in-repo claim-vs-reality verify counterpart.

## Out of scope (intentional, per "foundation right and deliberate")

- Plugin packaging (B-0169-domain follow-up)
- Hook authoring (separate row; depends on this tool maturing)
- Cross-harness portability (works via Bun for now; portable to Codex / Cursor / Gemini-CLI later)
- OpenSpec capability authoring (separate concern; OpenSpec catch-up has its own row)

## Pre-start checklist (backlog-item start gate — 2026-05-11 Riven)

**Prior-art search completed (surfaces logged):**

- wake-time-substrate, skill-router, orthogonal-axes, Otto-364, PR #1701, decision-archaeology (B-0169), lost-files at `tools/hygiene/LOST-FILES-LOCATIONS.md`
- Used Glob/Read/Grep equivalents on trajectories, memory/feedback_*, tools/substrate-claim-checker/*, docs/REVIEW-AGENTS.md, docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md BP-11/23/24/25
- Results: no duplicate implementation; this row is the canonical mechanization hub; related B-0169 decision-archaeology is downstream consumer. No conflicting prior art found. (Focused check run: `check-counts.ts` on canonical memo emitted 1 count-drift "6 sub-classes" vs 20 rows — confirms ongoing empirical need.)

**Dependency-restructure completed:**

- `depends_on: []` — no blockers; atomic children will be created in follow-up slices.
- Reciprocal `composes_with` backfilled on B-0169 row (cross-ref).
- Supersession history via decision-archaeology procedure: none (fresh foundation row).
- Broken pointers: none.

**Re-decomposition performed (assumes prior decomp had mistakes; re-checked against current shipped v0.9 state):**

- Original "atomic" overstated scope (done-criteria spans 7 check-types + hooks + fixtures + self-test).
- Re-decomposed into 4 smallest atomic dependency-ordered children (TS-first, one-bounded-slice each):
  - B-0170.1: semantic-equivalence-drift checker TS (command-substitution claims) — **shipped 2026-05-15** (`check-semantic-equivalence.ts` v1.0, warning-severity lexical detection; catches eval-set instance #12)
  - B-0170.2: empirical-output-drift checker TS (run-and-compare)
  - B-0170.3: self-recursive-drift checker TS (memo-about-X contains X) — in flight under sibling claim `otto-cli/b0170-3-self-recursive-checker-2026-05-15`
  - B-0170.4: fixture-tests + eval-set coverage for all shipped + new check-types

Previous slice landed the gate + re-decomp only. This slice ships B-0170.1 code (smallest safe slice: lexical detection, warning severity, no execution).

**Classification update:** decomposition: decomposed (was atomic); status remains open; last_updated bumped.
