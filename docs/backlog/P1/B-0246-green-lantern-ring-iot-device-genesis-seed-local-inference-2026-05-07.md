# B-0246 — Green Lantern ring: IoT wearable Genesis Seed

## What

A ring-form-factor IoT device running the Genesis Seed with
local ML inference, consent-first design, KSK gating, and
distributed policy cache. The wearable form factor of the
Ace/Itron edge gate architecture.

Aaron 2026-05-07: "stick it on a ring iot device and call it
the green lantern"

## The shape

- Ring hardware (IoT processor, local ML capable)
- Genesis Seed as the boot firmware
- Three dials as the user interface (LED/haptic feedback?)
- Consent-first default (KSK override for authorized use)
- Distributed policy cache on-device
- Hole puncher for communication (WebSocket through firewall)
- Receipts stored locally on-ring

## Why

Aaron built IoT ML at the edge at Itron. This is the same
primitive miniaturized to a wearable. The ring IS the edge
gate. The ring IS the Itron energy boundary. The ring IS the
hole puncher in wearable form.

The Green Lantern name: Aaron named it before knowing the DC
oath maps perfectly. "No shadow shall escape my sight" = the
BFT consensus oath. The ring is powered by will (honesty).
The Corps is a BFT network (7200 independent ring-bearers,
no central controller).

## Composes with

- B-0240 (structure recognizer) — runs on-ring
- B-0242 (WebSocket F# port) — ring communication
- B-0244 (coherence AI on GPUs) — ring queries GPU server
- B-0245 (consent-first + KSK) — ring's operating mode
- Ace package manager — distributes ring firmware DLCs
- Genesis Seed — the ring's boot prompt
