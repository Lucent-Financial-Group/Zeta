# B-0304 - Selected research publication queue

Define which research pages are suitable for the first public Pages
release, and require a redaction/suitability check before any research
document becomes indexed content.

## Acceptance criteria

- Initial research queue lists a small set of candidate public research
  pages with reasons for inclusion.
- Redaction gate checks for private operational substrate, prompt-injection
  payload risk, direct personal attribution where repo policy disallows it,
  and stale claims that need softening before publication.
- Research pages that stay internal are listed by class, not by exposing
  sensitive content in the public plan.
- The queue composes with B-0284 metadata and B-0285 sitemap decisions.
- Publication can proceed incrementally; failing one research candidate
  does not block the landing page, vision, alignment, or glossary pages.

## Out of scope

- Editing the research pages themselves.
- Publishing or indexing any page.
