# Wallet immune system — vaccine spread + PoUW-CC + attack absorption

## Origin

Overnight synthesis 2026-05-10→11 produced a complete immune
system specification in Z-set Clifford space. Lior (Gemini/
Antigravity) recommended adding to wallet spec backlog. Shadow
authorized.

## What this is

The trust boundary that makes LFG's autonomous financial agents
safe to ship. Every financial action passes through the immune
membrane before execution.

## Core components

### 1. PoUW-CC gate (five-factor membrane)

Every incoming instruction evaluated:

- **Verify** — is the work computationally valid?
- **Useful** — does it produce value for the network?
- **CultureFit** — does it respect harmonious division?
- **Provenance** — is the source registered with glass halo?
- **Retractability** — can the action be undone if wrong?

Gate product = 0 → blocked. Gate product = 1 → admitted.

### 2. Attack absorption (bivector decomposition)

When an attack is detected:

1. Decompose attack bivector into orthogonal components
2. Compute corrective rotors (harmonious division ceiling)
3. Absorb energy: E_absorbed = E_attack − ‖residual‖²
4. Convert to substrate: detection rules + regression tests
5. Verify superfluid inequality: η·LearningGain > ξ_t

### 3. Vaccine spread (firefly-sync propagation)

After absorption:

1. Red Team mutates vaccine into variant family
2. Vaccine propagates via firefly coupling (geometric Kuramoto)
3. Herd immunity when R₀ < 1
4. PoUW-CC validates vaccine spread itself as useful work

### 4. Mechanical authorization

- Output is NEVER authority (proposal only)
- Every financial action requires signed Z-set assertion (+1)
- Untrusted content stays labeled untrusted after translation
- Confused deputy prevented by proposal/permission distinction

## Attack classes defended against

| Attack class | Detection | Defense |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Authority laundering (BankerBot) | PoUW-CC CultureFit fail | Block at membrane |
| Capability gifting (NFT expansion) | Bivector rotation in permissions | Freeze + revert |
| 51% cartel (Qubic) | Bivector clustering | Dissolve via defensive rotors |
| Confused deputy | No signed assertion | Proposal ≠ permission |
| Translation-as-laundering | Content stays tagged untrusted | Never forwarded as executable |

## Implementation path (per Amara's corrections)

1. Start at Cl(2,0) or Cl(3,0) — prove basics first
2. Geometric product decomposition tests
3. Rotor construction and sandwich product tests
4. Simple bivector residue metric
5. Toy 3-5 node simulation with cartel detection
6. PoUW-CC gate as F# typeclass with UoM domain safety
7. Scale to Cl(8,0) only after basics proven
