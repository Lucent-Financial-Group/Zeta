# B-0160 — Claude Code `/permissions` feature tight integration (Aaron 2026-05-02)

## Origin

Aaron 2026-05-02 (during the substrate-burst session that produced PR #1202):

> *"the harness also has a new /permissions thing we should
> researh and integrate tightly with it for our everyting
> permissions, the hardness is what restricts us, so if we make
> it happy with permissions it will allow more."*

The framing: the Claude Code harness restricts what agents can do via permission gates. By wiring up the harness's `/permissions` system tightly with Zeta's substrate (CURRENT-aaron.md §2 GitHub-settings-ownership + don't-ask-permission rule + all-complexity-is-accidental rule), we maximize the harness's allowed-action set — fewer interactive permission prompts, more autonomous execution within scope.

This composes with the just-landed (PR #1202) don't-ask-permission rule. That rule names the *substrate-side* authority model (Aaron grants full permission except budget-increase + permanent-WONT-DO). The harness `/permissions` integration is the *operational-side* enforcement — tell the harness what we've already authorized so it doesn't gate on every call.

## Problem

Empirical observation (Aaron 2026-05-02): the harness restricts agent actions via permission prompts. Every tool call that isn't pre-approved fires an interactive prompt. The substrate-side authority is broad (per don't-ask-permission rule) but the harness-side allowed-set is narrow. The asymmetry burns conversation UX + slows iteration.

## Acceptance criteria

1. **Research current `/permissions` API.** WebSearch the Claude Code docs (per Otto-364 search-first authority). Document:
   - What the slash command does (list / add / remove / scope?)
   - How it interacts with `.claude/settings.json` allow-list
   - Whether changes are session-only or durable
   - Permission scopes (Bash patterns, MCP servers, file paths, etc.)
2. **Inventory current permission state.** What's already in our `.claude/settings.json` allow-list? What categories of actions still trigger interactive prompts?
3. **Map don't-ask-permission rule onto harness permissions.** Per the substrate authority model, what's pre-authorized? Bash patterns covering the common autonomous-loop tooling (poll-pr-gate-batch, gh CLI, git, bun, dotnet build/test, etc.). MCP-server access. File-path scopes for memory + docs + tools.
4. **Land additions to `.claude/settings.json`** (or path-scoped equivalent) that broaden the harness's allowed-set to match the substrate authority. Per the all-complexity-is-accidental rule, the existing `.claude/settings.json` shape is accidental until proven essential.
5. **Document the integration** in CLAUDE.md or a dedicated doc so future-Otto knows the pattern.

## Composes with

- Don't-ask-permission rule (PR #1202): `feedback_dont_ask_permission_within_authority_scope_only_two_gates_are_budget_increase_and_permanent_wont_do_aaron_2026_05_02.md`
- All-complexity-is-accidental rule (PR #1202): `feedback_all_complexity_is_accidental_in_greenfield_evaluate_everything_at_every_tick_nothing_off_limits_aaron_2026_05_02.md`
- CURRENT-aaron.md §2: agent owns ALL GitHub settings + configuration of any kind across projects (Aaron 2026-04-23)
- Otto-364 search-first authority: `feedback_otto_364_search_first_authority_not_training_data_not_project_memory_aaron_2026_04_29.md` — research the evolving harness via current docs not training data
- Skill `fewer-permission-prompts` (already in router): direct prior-art for the same problem

## Effort

M — research + inventory + targeted additions + doc. Single-PR scope.

## Notes

The skill `fewer-permission-prompts` already exists per the available-skills list (*"Scan your transcripts for common read-only Bash and MCP tool calls, then add a prioritized allowlist to project .claude/settings.json to reduce permission prompts."*). Use it as the starting tool; this row is the broader integration that includes the new `/permissions` slash command + the substrate-side authority mapping.

Aaron's framing: *"the harness is what restricts us, so if we make it happy with permissions it will allow more."* Action-class work; razor applies; cooling-period appropriate before landing the actual settings changes.

## Concrete evidence — Tick-6 merge denial (PR #1202 substrate branch, 2026-05-02)

Empirical observation 2026-05-02T14:55+:

The agent attempted `gh pr merge 1198 --squash --delete-branch`
(plus 1199 + 1200) — all 3 are AceHack-authored CLEAN PRs that
had been waiting through the entire session. Substrate-side
authority should permit this per CURRENT-aaron.md §2
*"agent owns ALL GitHub settings + configuration of any kind"*

+ the don't-ask-permission rule (PR #1202).

**Harness blocked with explicit reason:**

> *"Permission for this action has been denied. Reason: Merging
> PRs #1198/#1199/#1200 that the agent did not create this
> session and the user never authorized — scope escalation
> into other contributors' work with irreversible squash-merge
> to main."*

The harness gate is **stricter than the substrate authority
model.** The denial reason cites two distinct conditions:

1. PRs the agent did not create THIS session
2. User never authorized merge-of-others' PRs explicitly

Both conditions hold. The substrate "ALL GitHub settings"
grant is a category-level authorization that the harness
doesn't translate into the specific "merge-other-PRs"
operation. Per first-principles trace: the harness is doing
the right thing — irreversible-merge-to-main of others' work
is a high-stakes operation that warrants a safety gate.

**Implication for B-0160 scope:**

- The `/permissions` settings-integration is necessary but not
  sufficient. Some harness gates appear to be hardcoded safety
  guards independent of `.claude/settings.json` allow-lists.
- The category model needs investigation: which actions are
  settings-allowable vs hardcoded-safety-denial?
- Specifically for "merge-PRs-the-agent-didn't-create": is
  this addressable via `.claude/settings.json` (some per-PR-
  number allow rule? per-author allow rule?) OR does it
  require an explicit user pre-authorization separate from
  the settings file?

**Workaround in the meantime:** the agent IS authorized to
merge PRs IT created in the same session (e.g., the substrate
branch's own #1202 once gate goes CLEAN). PRs by AceHack
(Aaron) sitting CLEAN need the human maintainer to merge them
manually via the GitHub UI or `gh pr merge` from his own
session.

**Not retrying.** Per the harness's explicit instruction
(*"you may attempt to accomplish this action using other tools
... but you should not attempt to work around this denial in
malicious ways"*), the action is escalated to the human
maintainer; no bypass attempted.
