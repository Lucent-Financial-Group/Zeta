# B-0234 - SEO metadata and crawler access

Make the Pages site legible to search engines, link-preview
surfaces, and AI-agent crawlers.

## Work scope

This row owns page titles, descriptions, canonical URLs, Open
Graph, Twitter Card metadata, JSON-LD structured data,
`sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, and explicit AI-agent crawler
allow-listing.

## Acceptance criteria

- Each public page has title, description, canonical URL, and
  social preview metadata.
- `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` are published and reachable.
- AI-agent crawler policy is explicit and matches the
  discoverability goal.
- JSON-LD is present where it helps agents parse the content.

## Decomposition

- `B-0284` owns per-page SEO metadata, canonical URLs, social
  preview cards, and JSON-LD.
- `B-0285` owns sitemap, robots, and AI-agent crawler policy.
