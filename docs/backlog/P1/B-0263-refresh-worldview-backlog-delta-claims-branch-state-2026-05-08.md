# B-0263 — refresh-worldview additional queries

Second child of B-0159. Extend refresh.ts with:

1. Backlog row delta (docs/backlog/ file count vs stored snapshot)
2. Claim-file inventory (claim/* branches on origin)
3. Branch state (current branch ahead/behind origin/main)
4. Pending CI runs

## Acceptance criteria

- refresh.ts outputs backlogDelta, claims, branchState, pendingCI
- Single JSON output preserved
- tsc clean
