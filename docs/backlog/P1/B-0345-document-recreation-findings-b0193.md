# B-0345 — Document recreation findings

## Parent

B-0193 (bootstrap razor + 23-hour recreation test).

## What

Write findings to `docs/research/` with archive-header
(per GOVERNANCE.md §33). Structured as:

1. **What recreated cleanly** — code modules, directory
   structure, tooling that the fresh-context Otto derived
   from specs alone. These are bootstrap-commentary in
   the current Zeta repo (regenerable, cuttable).
2. **What diverged** — recreated but different. Interesting
   for substrate-as-product validation — do the specs
   constrain enough, or is there meaningful design-space
   freedom?
3. **What was missing** — code or substrate that exists in
   Zeta but the fresh-context Otto could not recreate from
   specs. Either the spec is incomplete (back-port gap via
   B-0346) or the artifact is genuinely novel/non-derivable
   (research-grade preservation category).
4. **Metrics evaluation** — score each dimension from the
   success-metrics rubric (B-0342).

## Acceptance criteria

1. Research-grade file at
   `docs/research/YYYY-MM-DD-bootstrap-razor-recreation-findings.md`
   with archive-header fields.
2. Each finding classified per the keep-vs-cut taxonomy
   (B-0339).
3. Spec-gap findings explicitly listed for B-0346 action.
4. Glass-halo: findings are honest regardless of whether
   they validate or falsify the regenerable claim.

## Effort

M — analysis + structured writeup from experiment data.
