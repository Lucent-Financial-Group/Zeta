# B-0469 — Scaffold Lucent-Financial-Group/civsim (Stage 1)

## What this row does

Execute Stage 1 of the product-repo split ADR (B-0468): scaffold the
`Lucent-Financial-Group/civsim` public repo with the full best-practice
checklist inherited from B-0424's by-default principle.

Civsim is the only product declared **repo-ready now** in B-0465/B-0466/B-0468.

## Pre-start checklist

### Prior-art search

- `create-repo.ts` at `tools/scaffold/create-repo.ts` covers `forge` and `ace`
  (factory repos) — needs product-repo variant for civsim
- `tools/scaffold/forge/` and `tools/scaffold/ace/` are the scaffold templates
- B-0424 `REPO_CONFIGS` pattern is the extension point
- No existing civsim scaffold directory
- Honor-system license at `docs/legal/HONOR-SYSTEM-LICENSE-DRAFT.md` is the LICENSE template
- ADR Stage 1 checklist is the authoritative source of truth

### Dependency check

- **B-0464** (closed, PR #3122) — license language ✓
- **B-0465** (closed, PR #3124) — civsim is repo-ready-now verdict ✓
- **B-0466** (closed, PR #3125) — approved slug: `civsim` ✓
- **B-0467** (closed, PR #3125) — glue mechanism: `.zeta-version` pin file ✓
- **B-0468** (closed, PR #3125) — ADR scaffold checklist ✓

All dependencies satisfied. Row is unblocked.

## Definition of done

Extend `create-repo.ts` to support product repos (distinct from factory repos):

- `civsim` added to `REPO_CONFIGS`
- Scaffold directory `tools/scaffold/civsim/` created with:
  - `README.md` — product carved sentence + honor-system license note
  - `LICENSE` — honor-system text from `docs/legal/HONOR-SYSTEM-LICENSE-DRAFT.md`
  - `.zeta-version` — pin file with current Zeta main SHA (immutable reference)
  - `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — product-scoped bootstrap
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` — product-scoped contributor guidance
- `bun tools/scaffold/create-repo.ts --repo civsim --dry-run` passes with expected operations
- PR merged

Note: the actual `--apply` invocation (which creates the real GitHub repo) is a
human-confirmed step — it falls under "actions visible to others / affect shared state"
(new GitHub repo). This row covers the tooling; the `--apply` step is documented
in the PR description as a manual follow-up.

## ADR scaffolding checklist (from B-0468)

- [ ] Repo created: `Lucent-Financial-Group/civsim`
- [ ] Visibility: **public** (glass-halo)
- [ ] LICENSE: honor-system text (mutual-privacy FAQ clause)
- [ ] `.zeta-version` pin file (immutable SHA/tag reference)
- [ ] Branch protection on `main`: `required_conversation_resolution` + squash-only + no-force-push
- [ ] CodeQL: enabled
- [ ] `.claude/CLAUDE.md`: product-scoped bootstrap
- [ ] Initial README: product carved sentence + honor-system license note
- [ ] `repository_dispatch` subscription: wired for Zeta release-tag events
- [ ] Claim released on bus after merge

## Key differences from factory repos (forge/ace)

| Property | Factory repos (forge/ace) | civsim (product repo) |
|----------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| License | Apache 2.0 | Honor-system |
| Forking | Welcome | "Please don't" honor-ask; EXCEPT civsim: forks welcome, mutual-privacy clause |
| AceHack mirror | Yes (step 05) | No (product repo; skip fork-to-AceHack) |
| `.zeta-version` | N/A | Required (glue mechanism Stage 1) |
| CLAUDE.md scope | Factory bootstrap | Product-scoped |
