# B-0366 — Alignment-clause drift detector

## Origin
Decomposed from B-0058 Step 4 to isolate the drift detector implementation for atomic execution.

## Ask
If a clause in `docs/ALIGNMENT.md` is about to be weakened or removed via the renegotiation protocol, this track generates the impact-survey across factory surfaces that touch the clause. Answers "who depends on this clause, and what breaks if it moves?" before the renegotiation is accepted.

## Owner / effort
