# B-0302 - Pages stable route map

Turn the approved public source inventory into stable URL paths before
search engines and AI-agent crawlers begin indexing the site.

## Acceptance criteria

- Route map assigns stable paths for the landing page, vision,
  alignment, glossary, contributor on-ramp, and selected research pages.
- URL scheme is documented as pre-indexing frozen unless a later PR
  explicitly includes redirects.
- Route map avoids leaking internal directory names such as `memory`,
  `hygiene-history`, `backlog`, or `claims`.
- Route naming composes with sitemap generation and canonical URLs in
  B-0284 and B-0285.
- Any deferred page class is called out with the prerequisite needed to
  add it later.

## Out of scope

- Implementing redirects.
- Publishing the sitemap or robots policy.
