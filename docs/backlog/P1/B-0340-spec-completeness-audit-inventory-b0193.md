# B-0340 — Spec completeness audit

## Parent

B-0193 (bootstrap razor + 23-hour recreation test).

## What

Run `bun tools/openspec/inventory.ts` (landed in B-0171,
PR #2147) against the current codebase and document:

1. Which `src/` modules have matching specs under
   `openspec/specs/`.
2. Which modules lack specs (spec-gap inventory).
3. Which specs reference code that no longer exists
   (spec-drift inventory).
4. Coverage of `docs/*.tla` formal specs vs code modules.

The output informs B-0341 (what to seed the test repo with)
and validates the "specs as source of truth" claim — if
large code areas lack specs, the 23-hour recreation test
will fail there by design, revealing the gap.

## Acceptance criteria

1. `bun tools/openspec/inventory.ts` runs cleanly and output
   is captured in `docs/bootstrap-razor/SPEC-AUDIT.md`.
2. Each gap is classified: spec-missing, spec-stale,
   formal-spec-missing.
3. Gap count is a numeric metric citeable by B-0341.

## Effort

S — run existing tool, format output.
