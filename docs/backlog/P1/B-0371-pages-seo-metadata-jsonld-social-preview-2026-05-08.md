# B-0284 - SEO metadata and structured data

Define the metadata layer for the GitHub Pages site once the
content inventory exists.

## Acceptance criteria

- Each public page has title, description, and canonical URL.
- Open Graph and Twitter Card metadata are emitted for link
  previews.
- JSON-LD is present where it improves agent parsing.
- Metadata defaults are centralized instead of duplicated per
  page.
