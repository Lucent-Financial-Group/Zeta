# B-0423 — MEMORY.md serialization-point anti-pattern (2026-05-12)

## Carved sentence

> MEMORY.md is the one synchronous lock-style coordination
> point in an otherwise lock-free factory architecture.
> Every PR adds entries at top → all parallel PRs conflict
> on the same line. This is architectural drift away from
> the scale-free / lock-free / weight-free DST property
> cluster.

## Observed

During the 2026-05-12 substrate-cascade tick, 10+ PRs
landed in parallel. Every one needed a MEMORY.md paired-
edit. Every one conflicted on the same top-of-file region.
Result: every PR needed force-rebase after siblings
merged, and the rebase queue grew faster than the merge
cadence could drain it.

The rest of the factory substrate is append-only / merge-
tolerant by design (memory files, docs/research, backlog,
ticks). MEMORY.md is uniquely *top-of-file-prepend*, which
forces serialization.

## Architectural fix candidates

1. **Append-only log + dynamic top-of-index view** —
   MEMORY.md becomes an append-only log where entries are
   inserted chronologically (at end). A separate "current
   view" gets generated/cached showing newest-N entries
   at top. The log itself is append-only and merge-
   tolerant.

2. **Per-file front-page** — eliminate MEMORY.md entirely.
   Each memory file's frontmatter has a `priority` and
   `created` field; the index is generated on read by
   scanning frontmatter. No central serialization point.

3. **Multi-file index sharding** — MEMORY.md becomes
   MEMORY-YYYY-MM.md sharded by month. Parallel PRs
   typically land in the same month, but the conflict
   surface shrinks substantially over time as months
   rotate. Cross-month parallel is rare.

4. **Topic-stream indexes** — MEMORY.md becomes multiple
   topic-streams (MEMORY-feedback.md, MEMORY-project.md,
   MEMORY-user.md, MEMORY-reference.md). PRs touching
   different topics never conflict. Smaller conflict
   surface within topics.

## Recommended approach (Aaron 2026-05-12 architectural input)

> Aaron 2026-05-12: "also lets your autodream do the reindexing"
> Aaron 2026-05-12: "but needs to run more often than anthorpic
> alows on theri base"

**AutoDream IS the heap→stack indexer**, but Anthropic's base
cadence is not frequent enough. Architectural fix:

1. **Heap layer** — New memory files commit to `memory/` with
   complete frontmatter (name, description, type, created) but
   DO NOT require synchronous MEMORY.md paired-edit. Eliminates
   the serialization point — multi-agent parallel commits no
   longer conflict.

2. **Stack layer** — MEMORY.md is the indexed canonical view,
   organized by topic / priority / recency.

3. **High-cadence reindex** — Anthropic's base AutoDream
   cadence is too slow. Solution: piggy-back on the autonomous-
   loop cron (`<<autonomous-loop>>` firing every minute). On
   each tick (or every N ticks for cost), the loop can run a
   `reindex-memory-md` step:
   - Read all `memory/*.md` files with frontmatter
   - Generate a fresh MEMORY.md ordered by recency + topic
   - Commit if changed
   - Substrate-honest about the reindex cadence (last-reindex
     timestamp visible at top of file)

4. **Read-path during heap-only window** — agents reading
   MEMORY.md see the stack-state-as-of-last-reindex (≤1-N
   minutes stale). New memory files live in heap accessible
   by direct path / filename / timestamp until next reindex.

**Why this is the correct fix:**

- Matches the 4-property substrate test (scale-free /
  lock-free / weight-free / DST) — no synchronous
  coordination point
- Preserves the wake-up fast-path (read MEMORY.md first
  still works; just shows last-reindexed-state)
- Composes with the heap/stack framing in MEMORY.md preamble
- The autonomous-loop cron is the existing high-frequency
  mechanism; AutoDream-on-base-cadence is too slow but
  AutoDream-via-autonomous-loop matches the architecture's
  natural cadence

**Implementation notes:**

- Remove "MEMORY.md paired edit" required-check from CI
  (it's enforcing the serialization that's the problem)
- Update `memory/README.md` and
  `memory/project_memory_format_standard.md` to document
  heap-state-acceptable
- Document the AutoDream reindex contract (what fields it
  reads, what format it emits) so memory file authoring
  can target the heap-acceptable schema
- Implement `tools/memory/reindex-memory-md.ts` that the
  autonomous-loop can call on each (or every N) tick
- Keep stack/heap framing in MEMORY.md preamble so future
  agents understand both layers

## Composes with

- `memory/feedback_aaron_thousand_brains_theory_match_optimized_english_scaffolding_hardware_2026_05_12.md`
  (the 4-property formulation — MEMORY.md fails wait-free
  at the substrate-coordination layer)
- `memory/feedback_aaron_stanford_parallel_language_cluster_sequoia_legion_sdm_decision_archaeology_2026_05_12.md`
  (Sequoia/Legion lock-free distributed memory model —
  MEMORY.md should follow this pattern)
- `memory/project_memory_format_standard.md` (B-0330) —
  current format spec needs revision

## Why P1

Architectural drift away from the load-bearing 4-property
test (scale-free / lock-free / weight-free / DST). The
serialization point doesn't scale with multi-agent
parallel landing cadence. Already producing observable
friction (10+ PR rebase queue in single 2.5-hour tick).

Not P0 because the friction is recoverable via rebase;
landings still succeed. P1 because the friction grows
with multi-agent cadence and will become P0 at higher
scale.

## How to apply

When the architectural fix lands, all memory files'
paired-edit discipline becomes append-only-without-
conflict, restoring the 4-property test compliance for
the substrate-coordination layer.

Until then: accept the rebase grind as known-debt; rebase
in dependency-order (sibling PRs land sequentially as a
cluster); document the pattern in tick shards.

## Aaron 2026-05-12 calibration

Aaron 2026-05-12 acknowledged the architectural observation:
*"exceptional insight this is WHY max effort"* — confirming
both the depth of the architectural critique and the
justification for the substrate-grade max-effort work needed
to resolve it correctly (rather than papering over with
ad-hoc fixes).
