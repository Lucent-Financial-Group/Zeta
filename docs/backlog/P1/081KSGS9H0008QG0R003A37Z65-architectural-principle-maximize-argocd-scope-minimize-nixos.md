## Carved sentence

> ArgoCD is used by ANYONE running Kubernetes (not just NixOS users); substrate-in-ArgoCD ports across every K8s cluster + every K8s distribution. NixOS-native substrate (NixOS modules, system.autoUpgrade, declarative-Nix-config) is load-bearing for the BOOT + OS layer, but BEYOND THAT every substrate-engineering decision should default to ArgoCD-managed for cross-cluster portability leverage.

## Problem

The cluster substrate has TWO management substrates at play:

- **NixOS-native** (flake.nix, NixOS modules, `nixos-rebuild`, `system.autoUpgrade`): declarative, atomic, replayable. BUT requires NixOS as the host OS — non-portable to K3S-on-Ubuntu, k3s-on-Alpine, talos-Linux, RKE2, EKS, GKE, AKS, OpenShift, etc.
- **ArgoCD-managed** (CRDs + Helm charts + Kustomize): also declarative + GitOps-native. AND portable to ANY K8s distribution.

When a substrate-engineering decision can be made either way, the cross-cluster portability tradeoff should default to **ArgoCD** unless there's a substrate-specific reason NixOS-native wins.

The maintainer 2026-05-26: *"ArgoCD is ususaly be anyone with k8s too not just nixos so antoher reason to push as much as possible into argocd."*

## Principle (operational discipline for future-Otto cold-boots)

When authoring substrate that could live in either layer:

1. **Prefer ArgoCD** for: K8s workloads, CRDs, controllers, Helm charts, container apps, cross-cluster federation primitives, anything that operates over the K8s API
2. **Use NixOS-native ONLY for**: boot substrate (kernel + initramfs + bootloader), OS-level config (systemd units that aren't workloads, NetworkManager, sshd, host-level packages), pre-K8s bootstrap (the path from "node booted" to "K8s API server reachable")
3. **Document the tradeoff** when choosing NixOS-native AGAINST ArgoCD-managed: name the substrate-specific reason (e.g., "K3S needs cluster-membership-token before ArgoCD can manage anything; the membership-token is OS-level bootstrap")

## What this principle changes in current substrate-engineering

| Area | Before | After (per principle) |
|---|---|---|
| iter-5.4.2 ArgoCD reconciler for ClusterNode CRs (081KSGS9H0008QG0R002K93MWX) | ✅ Already ArgoCD-managed — aligns | Reinforced |
| iter-6.1 system.autoUpgrade (081KSGS9H0008QG0R002T6J6FS) | NixOS-native for OS-level Nix flake updates | Stays NixOS-native; this is BOOT/OS layer; no portable alternative within Nix substrate |
| iter-6.2 kured (081KSGS9H0008QG0R003GM7TYN) | ArgoCD-managed app | ✅ Reinforced — kured is K8s-native, runs on any distro |
| iter-6.3 deploy-rs (081KSGS9H0008QG0R00280HHA7) | NixOS-native pull alternative to autoUpgrade | Stays in-scope but flagged: deploy-rs requires NixOS hosts; doesn't compose with cross-distro |
| iter-7 Crossplane (081KSGS9H0008QG0R001Y9FB62 sub-target 3) | ArgoCD-managed external-infra reconciler | ✅ Reinforced |
| iter-7 Ansible+Ace cross-OS (081KSGS9H0008QG0R001Y9FB62) | Host-side ansible-pull / Operator-pattern | Composes BOTH ways; principle doesn't override Aaron's "K8s always present + support both" 2026-05-26 |
| Future "control-plane bootstrap" decision (k3s vs k0s vs k3os vs kubeadm vs talos) | NixOS-baked vs ArgoCD-app-of-apps | Apply principle: prefer the path that lets ArgoCD bootstrap as much as possible |

## Implication for 081KSE6WT0008QG0R003CMCX84 (cluster-IS-DIO) end-state

The cluster-IS-deterministic-information-object end-state (081KSE6WT0008QG0R003CMCX84) becomes substrate-honest about WHERE that determinism lives:

- **Boot+OS layer**: NixOS substrate IS the DIO (declarative; replayable; atomic via nixos-rebuild)
- **K8s+workload layer**: ArgoCD-managed substrate IS the DIO (declarative; replayable; atomic via ArgoCD sync)
- **External infra layer**: Crossplane via ArgoCD IS the DIO (same reconciliation pattern)
- **Heterogeneous-OS layer** (iter-7): Ansible-pull + Ace IS the bridge for non-NixOS hosts

Composing all four reconcilers per the 4-reconciler shape from 081KSGS9H0008QG0R001Y9FB62. THIS row's principle adds: when the K8s+workload layer can subsume something that would otherwise live at boot+OS layer, prefer the K8s+workload (ArgoCD) path for cross-distro portability.

## Implication for the iter-5.4 arc

iter-5.4.2 (081KSGS9H0008QG0R002K93MWX) IS the right shape: the cluster-nodes reconciler watches the git tree + applies labels/taints/role-workloads via K8s API. NOT via NixOS modules. This means an operator running K3S-on-Ubuntu OR k3s-on-Alpine OR Talos OR any other K8s distro could adopt iter-5.4.x substrate by:

1. Skipping the NixOS-side install.sh (use their own bootstrap)
2. Cloning the Zeta repo's `maintainers/<op>/cluster-nodes/<host>/` tree shape
3. Pointing their ArgoCD at the tree
4. Running iter-5.4.1-equivalent self-registration with `bun tools/cluster/deregister-node.ts` + a future `register-node.ts` companion

The iter-5.4.0 gh-auth-login piece happens at install time; the rest is K8s API + git, both portable.

## Implication for Ace package manager (081KQZVQW0008QG0R000ZHEN62/081KR2E4K0008QG0R002YE3MMD/081KSE6WT0008QG0R000YYH3DY)

Ace becomes the cross-distro bootstrap of WHATEVER ArgoCD then manages. The path:

1. Operator boots their distro of choice (NixOS / Ubuntu / Alpine / Talos / whatever)
2. Operator runs `ace install argocd` (or `nix build .#installer-iso` if NixOS-native)
3. ArgoCD applies the Zeta substrate (CRDs + apps + reconcilers + iter-5.4.x cluster-nodes-reconciler)
4. Cluster converges

Ace is the entry point per the 081KSGS9H0008QG0R001Y9FB62 architecture; ArgoCD is the convergence engine. NixOS-native is one of N possible host substrates that the entry point composes with.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Future authoring decisions in cluster substrate cite this row when choosing between NixOS-native vs ArgoCD-managed
- [ ] 081KSE6WT0008QG0R003CMCX84 cluster-IS-DIO row updated with the 4-layer DIO decomposition above (sibling PR; not this row)
- [ ] 081KSGS9H0008QG0R002K93MWX iter-5.4.2 reconciler row updated to explicitly note its cross-distro portability per this principle (sibling PR; not this row)
- [ ] Future iter-N proposals classify themselves per the principle table above

## Out of scope

- Implementing K3S-on-Ubuntu or other-distro variants now (the principle enables future portability; doesn't mandate immediate impl)
- Rewriting existing NixOS-native substrate that's legitimately NixOS-only (autoUpgrade for the Nix flake itself; not portable)
- Picking the "right" K8s distribution (operator's choice; Zeta substrate is distro-agnostic per this principle)

- `grep -rlF "ArgoCD"` → existing references across iter-5.4.x + iter-6.x rows (consumes ArgoCD); no existing principle row
- `grep -rlF "portability"` + `grep -rlF "cross-cluster"` → 081KSE6WT0008QG0R002CC6314 + B-0741 substrate at fork-federation scope; this row's scope is the host-distribution scope (different)

## Origin

The maintainer 2026-05-26 immediately after the iter-6.0 nixpkgs bump landed:

> *"nice also ArgoCD is ususaly be anyone with k8s too not just nixos so antoher reason to push as much as possible into argocd."*

## Empirical prior-art anchor (Aaron 2026-05-26)

The principle ISN'T speculative — the maintainer 2026-05-26 named the empirical lineage + use-cases:

> *"ArgoCD becomes universal convergence engine. exactly its perfect for this it's been used at GitHub and LexisNexis for very similar reasons. Me and my friend built this at LexisNexis and he carried it to GitHub."*
>
> *"At LexisNexis we used it for a Legal Search Data Pipeline for GitHub they use it for CoPilot training pipeline."*
>
> *"both places we could run in any cloud with 0 external vendor dependencies that were not open source"*

The pattern was built + validated at **3 contexts** by the same operator-lineage now building Zeta:

| Context | Use-case | Scale | Vendor lock-in |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LexisNexis** | Legal Search Data Pipeline | Enterprise; mixed-distro K8s | 0 external; open-source only |
| **GitHub** | Copilot training pipeline | Planet-scale; even more heterogeneous infra | 0 external; open-source only |
| **Zeta (this substrate)** | Cluster-native AI substrate | Homelab + small-cluster + cross-distro reach | 0 external; open-source only (per Zeta's own dependency discipline) |

Three load-bearing properties carried across all three contexts:

1. **Run in ANY cloud** — no AWS-only / GCP-only / Azure-only substrate; the same convergence engine works wherever K8s runs (homelab, single-cloud, multi-cloud, hybrid, air-gapped)
2. **0 external vendor dependencies** — no commercial control planes, no proprietary orchestrators, no closed-source schedulers. Anything required is open-source + can be replaced with another open-source equivalent
3. **ArgoCD as the convergence engine** — same shape; same git-as-source-of-truth pattern; same CR reconciliation model

Composes directly with [081KR2E4K0008QG0R002YE3MMD](081KR2E4K0008QG0R002YE3MMD-ace-dlc-package-manager-cli-2026-05-08.md) (Ace) and [081KSE6WT0008QG0R000YYH3DY](../P2/081KSE6WT0008QG0R000YYH3DY-reference-k8s-local-stack-as-aces-distributable-poc-hats-as-negotiated-fork-structure-on-top-deterministic-declarative-gitops-ai-native-human-native-aaron-2026-05-25.md) (Ace's distributable POC). Zeta inherits all 3 properties: Ace bootstraps the substrate without vendor lock-in; ArgoCD converges it across any K8s distro; the entire stack is open-source.

### Why ArgoCD specifically (not Flux) — historical decision lineage (Aaron 2026-05-26)

The ArgoCD-vs-Flux decision was made empirically at LexisNexis (and carried to GitHub) based on the maintainer's load-bearing-feature evaluation at the time:

> *"We tried to use Flux too i just didn't have the featues we need at the time it had no sync waves, i think they have something now and it had poor self healing and not equal to rollouts"*

Three feature gaps in Flux at decision time that ArgoCD covered:

1. **Sync waves** — ArgoCD supports phased deployment ordering via `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave` annotations (e.g., CRDs in wave 0, controllers in wave 1, workloads in wave 2). Flux at the time had no equivalent; deployments arrived without ordering guarantees. Load-bearing for cluster bring-up substrate where ordering matters (CRDs MUST exist before CR consumers).

2. **Self-healing quality** — ArgoCD's `selfHeal: true` (per `syncPolicy.automated`) is mature + battle-tested at LN + GH scale. Flux's self-healing was weaker at decision time.

3. **Rollouts (blue-green / canary)** — Argo Rollouts (the sibling project) provides progressive-delivery patterns (blue-green deployments, canary analysis, automated rollback on health-check failure). Flux had no equivalent at decision time.

The maintainer's note: *"i think they have something now"* — Flux MAY have caught up on some/all of these since the decision was made. But the substrate decision is rooted in proven LN+GH operational evidence; switching engines is itself a substantive substrate-engineering cost. Re-evaluation possible if Flux now demonstrably exceeds ArgoCD on Zeta's specific needs; default remains ArgoCD per the empirical lineage.

**2026-state Flux gap is narrower** (clarifying nuance Aaron 2026-05-26 surfaced via the ServiceTitan-uses-Flux observation): Flux + Argo Rollouts compose cleanly. Argo Rollouts is a Kubernetes controller (CRDs: `Rollout`, `AnalysisTemplate`, `Experiment`, `AnalysisRun`) under the Argoproj umbrella but with **zero hard dependency on ArgoCD**. Flux can install the rollouts controller via `HelmRelease` against `https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm` and reconcile `Rollout` CRs from git via `Kustomization`, with `dependsOn:` handling install-before-consume ordering. Flux's own native progressive-delivery answer is **Flagger** (sibling CNCF project; integrates with Linkerd / Istio / Contour / Gloo / NGINX). So a Flux shop in 2026 has two viable paths: Flux + Flagger (all-Flux-native) OR Flux + Argo Rollouts (best-of-breed PD with GitOps). Both ship in production. ServiceTitan-on-Flux specifically could pull in Argo Rollouts tomorrow via one `HelmRelease` if they don't already.

Zeta's ArgoCD choice still holds per the empirical LN+GH lineage + ArgoCD's tighter sync-wave + selfHeal integration with the same engine; the maintainer's "i think they have something now" caveat is partially correct (Flux + Flagger + dependsOn-graph + improved self-healing all exist now), but the substrate-switching cost dominates re-evaluation absent specific Flux-superior need.

Observation for Zeta substrate: when adopting any iter-N CR / app / chart, ArgoCD's sync-wave + selfHeal + (where progressive-delivery matters) Argo Rollouts are the empirically-validated default. Designing for engine-independence-as-primary-concern adds substrate cost; per the LN+GH+Zeta lineage the engine choice is settled enough that operator-default is "use the validated stack" rather than "abstract over the engine"; per `.claude/rules/no-directives.md` operators remain free to deviate when specific evidence supports doing so. **Cross-cluster portability principle still holds even when other teams use Flux**: the K8s manifests (CRDs + Deployments + Services + Rollout CRs) are engine-agnostic; only the sync-engine-specific glue (`Application` for ArgoCD; `Kustomization`/`HelmRelease` for Flux) differs. A Flux-shop adopting Zeta substrate would wrap the same K8s manifests in Flux primitives — substantively the same portability win.

### Helm-as-convergence-point + multi-engine-experimentation substrate (Aaron 2026-05-26)

The maintainer's sharper architectural framing surfaced during the ServiceTitan-uses-Flux conversation:

> *"Yes really helm is the convergence point between flux and argocd with different config wrappers for each system i don't mind supporting both long term but i'm famliar with argocd more than flux but i've heard flux is simpler so this is only reason i want multi cluster to experienment with huge things like this, also i like the depend_on that's clean as fuck."*

Four operational substrate refinements:

**1. Helm IS the convergence point.** Both Flux (`HelmRelease`) and ArgoCD (`Application` with `source.chart` / `source.repoURL` pointing at a Helm repo) consume the SAME Helm charts — they just wrap them in engine-specific config. Authoring substrate as Helm charts maximizes engine-portability automatically; the wrapper-per-engine cost is small (~30 lines of YAML per app per engine).

**2. Supporting BOTH long-term is OK.** The original "ArgoCD locked-in per LN+GH+Zeta lineage" framing is correct as the DEFAULT, but multi-engine support is explicitly within scope per the maintainer's "i don't mind supporting both long term." The substrate architecture supports this when authored as: (a) Helm charts as the source of truth, (b) ArgoCD `Application` wrappers shipped by default, (c) Flux `HelmRelease` wrappers as additive overlay when a multi-cluster experiment justifies them.

**3. Multi-cluster IS the experimentation substrate.** The reason multi-cluster matters extends beyond cross-cloud-portability — it's the substrate for direct A/B engine-comparison on production-shape workloads. Aaron's framing: *"i've heard flux is simpler so this is only reason i want multi cluster to experienment with huge things like this."* Empirical comparison (cluster-A on ArgoCD; cluster-B on Flux; same Helm charts; same workloads) gives substrate-honest evidence about which engine's tradeoffs fit Zeta's specific shape. This is bandwidth-served work (per `.claude/rules/bandwidth-served-falsifier.md`): bandwidth served = operator's engine-evaluation needs comparable production-shape data to override the LN+GH-era decision; multi-cluster experimentation provides exactly that.

**4. Flux's `dependsOn` is explicitly endorsed.** Aaron's framing: *"i like the depend_on that's clean as fuck."* This is a cross-engine learning opportunity:

- **In Flux**: `dependsOn` is the per-Kustomization / per-HelmRelease declarative dependency primitive (one resource declares dependency on another by name; Flux reconciler waits before applying).
- **In ArgoCD**: the equivalent is `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave` annotations (numeric ordering — wave 0 before wave 1 before wave 2). Less explicit than Flux's named-dependency model; relies on operators picking wave numbers thoughtfully.
- **Operational implication for Zeta substrate**: when authoring ArgoCD `Application` manifests, prefer EXPLICIT sync-wave numbers + comments documenting WHAT each wave provides — closes the legibility gap vs Flux's `dependsOn` even if the syntax is less ergonomic. Future possibility: a small TS substrate (`tools/cluster/argocd-deps-to-waves.ts`) that takes a dependency graph and emits the correct sync-wave annotations could land if the manual approach becomes painful.

### Substrate architecture implication: Helm-charts-first design

Combining all four refinements yields a clean substrate architecture:

```
maintainers/<op>/cluster-apps/<app>/
├── chart/                 # Helm chart (source of truth; engine-agnostic)
│   ├── Chart.yaml
│   ├── values.yaml
│   └── templates/
├── argocd/
│   └── application.yaml   # ArgoCD wrapper (default)
└── flux/                  # OPTIONAL — only when multi-engine substrate is in scope
    └── helmrelease.yaml   # Flux wrapper
```

For workloads where only ArgoCD ships, the `flux/` directory is absent (no maintenance burden). For workloads in multi-engine experimentation scope, the `flux/` directory ships alongside. The Helm chart itself never changes between engines — that's the convergence point.

This composes with the cross-distro portability principle (the top of this row): just as the K8s manifests are distro-agnostic, the Helm charts are engine-agnostic. Two orthogonal portability axes (distro + engine); same substrate-engineering discipline (push to the convergence point; wrap thinly per environment).

### Developer force-multiplier ladder — Helm + Kustomize + Dockerfile is today's top tier (Aaron 2026-05-26)

The maintainer's framing on why this whole substrate matters at human-developer scope:

> *"helm + kustomze + dockerfile as a developer before our AI runbooks we are going to create with run, deffered run/continue with, and auto jit those tools offer the higest force multiler to any human i think today to levderge technology of others."*

The framing names two layers:

**Today's top force-multiplier tier (Helm + Kustomize + Dockerfile)**: small declarative configs → leverage massive infrastructure others built. A single human can stand up production-shape K8s workloads on any cloud, packaged with arbitrary OS/runtime/dep substrate, via three declarative-config tools. This IS why this row's "Helm-as-convergence-point" framing is load-bearing — Helm sits on the highest-force-multiplier rung available to developers today; standardizing on it maximizes the leverage Zeta inherits from the entire CNCF ecosystem.

| Tool | What it leverages | Force-multiplier vector |
|---|---|---|
| **Dockerfile** | Linux container runtime + 10M+ public images | Runtime/dep packaging |
| **Helm** | Charts ecosystem (Bitnami, Argo, Prometheus, etc.) + Helm operator pattern | App-level configuration + lifecycle |
| **Kustomize** | K8s native + GitOps-friendly overlay-without-templating | Environment/cluster customization |

The discipline composes: Dockerfile packages the runtime; Helm wraps it as a chart; Kustomize overlays per-environment; ArgoCD or Flux syncs from git. Four declarative layers; each leverages a different OSS substrate; combined leverage is multiplicative.

**Tomorrow's top force-multiplier tier (AI runbooks — separate row [081KSGS9H0008QG0R0005P83AP](../P1/081KSGS9H0008QG0R0005P83AP-ai-runbook-substrate-run-deferred-run-continue-with-auto-jit-as-next-force-multiplier-layer-above-helm-kustomize-dockerfile-aaron-2026-05-26.md))**: the next layer Zeta is building extends the force-multiplier ladder above Helm+Kustomize+Dockerfile. The three new primitives Aaron named — `run` / `deferred run / continue with` / `auto JIT` — are what AI runbooks add. That substrate is filed separately as 081KSGS9H0008QG0R0005P83AP; this row's scope stays on the developer-today layer.

**Substrate-engineering implication for 081KSGS9H0008QG0R003A37Z65**: maximizing ArgoCD scope (this row's top-line principle) is essentially "ride the Helm+Kustomize+Dockerfile + GitOps-engine force-multiplier ladder to the top rung". Push every operational decision toward the highest-leverage substrate; resist NixOS-native lock-in for things ArgoCD can do per the cross-distro principle; resist engine lock-in for things Helm can do per the Helm-as-convergence-point principle. Both are instances of "ride the highest force-multiplier substrate available today; don't reinvent."

This anchor changes the P1 classification's basis: not "architectural reasoning that might apply"; rather "pattern validated at LexisNexis-scale + GitHub-scale + now Zeta-scale; the same constraints (cloud-agnostic + 0-vendor-lock-in + ArgoCD-convergence) hold across all three". Future-Otto cold-booting reads: this principle has 3 scale-evidenced anchors; treat it as load-bearing for every cluster-substrate decision.

Filed as P1 because architectural principles inform every subsequent substrate-engineering decision; landing the principle BEFORE iter-7 implementation work begins ensures the cross-distro portability framing is baked into the foundation rather than retrofitted. Empirical anchor strengthens the P1 classification (not speculative; validated at scale across 3 contexts).

NOT a directive per `.claude/rules/no-directives.md` — operator autonomy on each authoring decision preserved; this row just makes the tradeoff explicit so the right answer becomes legible.
