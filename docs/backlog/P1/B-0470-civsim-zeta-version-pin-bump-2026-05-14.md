# B-0470 — Bump civsim `.zeta-version` to apply-time Zeta main SHA

## Context

When `bun tools/scaffold/create-repo.ts --repo civsim --apply` ran (2026-05-14T10:52Z),
the scaffold template's `.zeta-version` file contained the SHA at PR #3125 merge time
(`eaea0682bd50344404c975e9d8eac4bb95e2c2bc`). The actual Zeta main at apply-time was
one commit ahead (`ce5c4101e9d3d78550215cc5ef8152cffb63b8cc`, PR #3126 merge).

Per the ADR: "Update .zeta-version pin file to the actual current Zeta main SHA after
repo creation."

## What this row does

Open a PR on `Lucent-Financial-Group/civsim` that bumps `.zeta-version`:

```
eaea0682bd50344404c975e9d8eac4bb95e2c2bc
```

→

```
ce5c4101e9d3d78550215cc5ef8152cffb63b8cc
```

## Done criteria

- PR opened on `Lucent-Financial-Group/civsim` with the 1-line `.zeta-version` bump
- PR merged (requires 1 review per branch protection)
- `.zeta-version` in civsim/main reflects Zeta HEAD at apply-time

## Notes

- Branch protection on civsim requires 1 approving review — this is a quick PR
- This is a low-urgency chore; the 1-commit difference has no functional impact
- The `.zeta-version` will next be bumped when the first Zeta release tag is emitted
  (glue mechanism Stage 1)
