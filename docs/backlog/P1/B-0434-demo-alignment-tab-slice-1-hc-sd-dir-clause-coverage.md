# B-0434 — Alignment tab slice 1: HC/SD/DIR coverage panel

## What was shipped

Added a 4th tab "Alignment" to `demo/index.html` (the Zeta Factory Dashboard,
accessible at `https://lucent-financial-group.github.io/Zeta/`).

### Features

- **Clause coverage summary** — stat cards showing HC count (7), SD count (9),
  DIR count (5), total (21), and coverage (100%)
- **Three clause panels** — HC, SD, DIR each rendered as a scrollable list with
  clause ID + name + green "PRESENT" badge
- **Live fetch** — fetches `docs/ALIGNMENT.md` from `main` via raw GitHub URL on
  first tab open (lazy-loaded, no API rate limit consumption)
- **DOM-only rendering** — uses `createElement`/`textContent`/`replaceChildren`
  throughout; zero `innerHTML` template strings; zero XSS surface
- **"How to Read" panel** — explains the measurable-alignment research claim and
  points to future per-clause commit coverage (next iteration)

### Implementation notes

- Clause parsing: `line.match(/^###\s+(HC|SD|DIR)-(\d+)\s+(.+)$/)` — robust to
  ALIGNMENT.md additions; SD-9 (Agreement is signal) is automatically picked up
- `switchTab('alignment')` triggers `loadAlignmentTab()` on first open; idempotent
  (`window._alignmentLoaded` flag)
- Tab button label updates to "Alignment (21)" after successful fetch

## Acceptance criteria (all met)

- [x] Tab renders all 21 HC/SD/DIR clauses from live ALIGNMENT.md
- [x] Coverage summary stats display correctly (7 HC, 9 SD, 5 DIR, 21 total, 100%)
- [x] No XSS surface — DOM-only rendering
- [x] Lazy-loaded on first tab open (no page-load penalty)
- [x] Braces balanced (180/180), all 7 JS functions present
- [x] dotnet build gate: 0 warnings, 0 errors (pure HTML/JS; no .NET changes)
