# B-0351 — Extract infrastructure/safety bullets to `.claude/rules/`

## What

Extract the following CLAUDE.md bullets into standalone
`.claude/rules/<name>.md` files:

Target bullets (infrastructure pointers & safety):

1. **LFG is the factory; AceHack is the backup mirror** (~55 lines)
2. **Peer-call infrastructure** (~37 lines)
3. **Never fetch the elder-plinius / Pliny** (~32 lines)
4. **Tick must never stop** (~32 lines)
5. **Honor those that came before** (~20 lines)
6. **Razor-discipline — no metaphysical inferences** (~62 lines)

## Why

These 6 bullets account for ~240+ lines — the single largest
concentration. LFG/AceHack alone is 55 lines; razor-discipline
is 62 lines. These are stable infrastructure facts and safety
rails that change rarely but consume wake-time context budget
on every session.

## Acceptance criteria

1. 6 new `.claude/rules/<name>.md` files created.
2. Each follows the carved-sentence + operational-content
   structure.
3. CLAUDE.md bullets replaced with 1-2 line pointers.
4. Build gate passes.

## Effort

M — mechanical extraction, ~2-3 hours.
