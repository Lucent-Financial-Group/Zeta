# B-0339 — Keep-vs-cut criteria documentation

## Parent

B-0193 (bootstrap razor + 23-hour recreation test).

## What

Document the keep-vs-cut taxonomy as a project-policy file
before any experiment runs. The four categories from Aaron
2026-05-05 + Claude.ai same-tick:

1. **Research-grade preservation** — mirror-not-beacon
   shards, falsifiability-catches, external-AI conversation
   absorbs. Not regeneratable from specs by definition.
   Kept as research artifact.
2. **Decision rationale** — tried-X-failed-because-Y.
   Sometimes capturable from commit messages + resulting
   spec, sometimes only in feedback files. The 23-hour test
   will cut some; whether that's feature or bug depends on
   whether the rationale was load-bearing.
3. **External-context files** — genealogy, calibration docs,
   persona biographies. Different ontological category,
   different rules. Kept under own discipline.
4. **Personal-history surfaces** — CURRENT-aaron.md /
   CURRENT-amara.md / etc. Per-maintainer first-party-consent
   surfaces; kept regardless.

## Acceptance criteria

1. A `docs/bootstrap-razor/KEEP-VS-CUT.md` file defines each
   category with examples from actual Zeta substrate.
2. Each category has a clear disposition: KEEP (never cut),
   CUT-IF-REGENERABLE (the test decides), or EXEMPT (outside
   experiment scope).
3. The criteria are citable by B-0344 (the experiment run).

## Effort

S — pure documentation, no tooling needed.
