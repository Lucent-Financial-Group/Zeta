# B-0301 - Pages public source inventory

Create the first explicit inventory of repository documents that are
eligible for the public GitHub Pages site, along with the hard exclusion
boundary for internal substrate.

## Acceptance criteria

- Public source inventory names the initial landing, vision, alignment,
  glossary, contributor on-ramp, and selected research source files.
- Internal exclusions are explicit for `memory/`, `docs/hygiene-history/`,
  `docs/backlog/`, `docs/claims/`, and operational loop state.
- Each eligible source has a short reason it belongs on the public site.
- Each excluded class has a short reason it stays internal substrate.
- The inventory is repo-native and can be consumed by later route and SEO
  work without scraping prose from B-0154.

## Out of scope

- Rendering pages.
- Writing SEO metadata.
- Choosing final URL slugs beyond enough naming to unblock B-0302.
