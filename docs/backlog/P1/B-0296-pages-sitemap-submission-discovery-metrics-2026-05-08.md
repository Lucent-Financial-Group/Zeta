# B-0296 - Sitemap submission and discovery metrics

Define the external discovery handoff after the Pages metadata,
sitemap, and crawler policy are live.

## Acceptance criteria

- Google Search Console submission path is documented or
  completed.
- Bing Webmaster Tools submission path is documented or completed.
- Discovery metrics are defined: time-to-index, target-query
  ranking, crawler hit rate, and external contributor source.
- Measurement composes with the existing observability or
  timeseries lane instead of creating a second metrics substrate.
