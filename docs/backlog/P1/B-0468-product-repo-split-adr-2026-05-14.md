# B-0468 — ADR: product-repo split decisions (closes B-0425)

## What this row does

Author the **Architecture Decision Record** capturing all product-repo split decisions.
This row closes B-0425 when merged.

The ADR synthesizes the outputs of all prior child rows:
- B-0464 (license language)
- B-0465 (substrate inventory + repo-readiness verdicts)
- B-0466 (approved repo slugs)
- B-0467 (cross-repo glue mechanism)

## Depends on (all four)

- **B-0464** — honor-system license language ready
- **B-0465** — per-product verdict: repo-ready now / later / stays-in-monorepo
- **B-0466** — approved repo slugs for "now" and provisional slugs for "later" products
- **B-0467** — cross-repo glue mechanism decided

## ADR structure

The ADR will be created at:
`docs/DECISIONS/2026-05-14-product-repo-split-decisions.md`

### Sections

**Context**

- Two-axis split: factory-infrastructure (B-0424) vs product-portfolio (B-0425)
- Glass-halo + honor-system license design (Aaron 2026-05-13)
- Sibling of the three-repo-split ADR

**Decision**

- Which products get repos, which don't (yet), which stay in monorepo
- Repo slugs (from B-0466)
- License applied (from B-0464)
- Cross-repo glue mechanism (from B-0467)
- Staging timeline: "now" products vs "later" products

**Consequences**

- Factory-product separation of concerns
- Each product repo gets its own CI/CD, branch protection, CodeQL scope
- Honor-system license is a social/cultural contract; glass-halo preserved
- civsim forkable ecosystem enabled; mutual privacy at fork scope

**Open questions** (not blocking the ADR)

- When does ace ship? (determines glue mechanism migration path from pin-files
  to `ace pull`)
- Which products are ready for public-announce vs "public but not announced"?
- Strategic-encryption scope (gitcrypt): which product repos need this layer?
  (Per Otto's strategic-encryption authority, PR #2902)

**Migration path**

- Stage 1: create repos for "repo-ready now" products (scaffolding via B-0424
  `create-repo.ts` pattern, adapted for product repos)
- Stage 2: move product substrate from Zeta monorepo to product repos
- Stage 3: when ace ships, migrate pin-files to `ace.toml`

**Scaffolding checklist** (per B-0424's "by-default principle")

Each product repo inherits the full Zeta hard-won best-practices checklist — the ADR
records this inheritance explicitly so product repos don't need to re-justify each
item.

## Supersedes

This ADR does NOT supersede `docs/DECISIONS/2026-04-22-three-repo-split-zeta-forge-ace.md`.
It is a **companion ADR** for the product axis. The factory-infrastructure ADR and
product-portfolio ADR are sibling documents.

## Definition of done

- ADR created at `docs/DECISIONS/2026-05-14-product-repo-split-decisions.md`
- All four dependency outputs (B-0464 / B-0465 / B-0466 / B-0467) referenced
- Decision table present: which products get repos + when + what slug + what license
- Staging timeline present
- B-0425 marked closed with this ADR's PR as the closing reference
