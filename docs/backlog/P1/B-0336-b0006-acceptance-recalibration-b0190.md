# B-0336 — B-0006 acceptance recalibration

## Parent

B-0190 acceptance criterion 3: "B-0006 acceptance criteria
recalibrated — the original <=200-char-per-entry is unreachable
for 440 entries; either narrow target or formally accept the
deviation."

## What

Recalibrate B-0006's acceptance criteria using the load-bearing
classification from B-0332:

1. **Differentiated targets** — load-bearing entries get more
   space (up to ~200 chars); decorative entries get aggressive
   compression (~100 chars) or are candidates for index removal.
2. **Feasibility check** — given the current entry count, what
   per-entry char target keeps MEMORY.md under 200 lines?
3. **Update B-0006** — edit its acceptance criteria section to
   reflect the recalibrated targets.

## Why depends on B-0332

The load-bearing-vs-decorative classification determines which
entries deserve more index space and which can be compressed
aggressively or removed from the index.

## Acceptance criteria

1. B-0006's acceptance criteria section updated with
   recalibrated, achievable targets.
2. Targets differentiate load-bearing vs decorative entries.
3. Feasibility math shown (entry count x target chars <=
   200 lines).

## Why S effort

Analysis + one file edit. No tooling needed.
