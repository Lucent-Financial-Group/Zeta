# B-0486 — Civsim persona map

## Purpose

Produce the canonical persona map for **Civsim** — the factory's highest-substrate-maturity
product (PR #2903, #2906, B-0469 live). Civsim is first because existing substrate is
richest, yielding the most grounded initial persona inventory.

## Pre-start checklist

Per `.claude/rules/backlog-item-start-gate.md`:

- [ ] Template from B-0485 is closed and available
- [ ] Read PR #2903 (Civsim repo scaffold) for product description
- [ ] Read PR #2906 (Civsim governance) for persona signals
- [ ] Read B-0469 (civsim --apply live) for usage context
- [ ] Walk `composes_with:` chain

## Persona hypotheses (to be validated)

| Persona type | Candidate | Source hint |
|---|---|---|
| Primary | Edge-runner developer building civic simulations | PR #2906 governance charter |
| Primary | Policy researcher / scenario modeler | civsim product charter |
| Secondary | Civic technologist integrating Civsim outputs | PR #2909 language escalation |
| Adjacent | Academic studying AI-assisted civic modeling | peer-review substrate |
| Refused | State-level covert influence operator | methodology-hard-limits |

## Output

Per-product persona map using template from B-0485:

```
docs/personas/civsim-personas.md
```

With:
- Primary / secondary / adjacent / refused persona entries (template schema)
- HARD LIMITS check for refused personas
- Substrate references for each persona (which PR/memory supports it)

## Definition of done

- [ ] Template from B-0485 applied
- [ ] At least 2 primary personas documented with full template fields
- [ ] At least 1 refused persona documented with HARD LIMITS rationale
- [ ] Output doc committed at canonical path
- [ ] B-0492 `composes_with:` pointer backfilled
- [ ] B-0486 status set to `closed` with PR link

## Why P1

Civsim is the live product (B-0469 shipped). Persona clarity unblocks
skill authoring for Civsim (per PR #2933 ships-with-skills). Also provides
the first worked example of the template from B-0485.
