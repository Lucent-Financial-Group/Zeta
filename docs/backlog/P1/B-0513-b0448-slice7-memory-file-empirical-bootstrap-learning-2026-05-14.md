# B-0513 — Memory file capturing empirical Cloud Routine bootstrap learning

## Purpose

After the first empirical Cloud Routine fire (B-0511), capture the operational
learnings in a durable memory file — analogous to the split-brain memory
(`memory/feedback_otto_inter_surface_communication_channels_8_channels_ambient_vs_explicit_aaron_2026_05_13.md`)
that documented the multi-surface communication substrate.

This is the "substrate-or-it-didn't-happen" landing for Cloud Routine integration:
the empirical observations + operational surprises must become wake-time
substrate so future-Otto inherits the knowledge at cold-boot.

**Depends on B-0511** — requires empirical fire observations to exist.

## Memory file to author

```
memory/feedback_cloud_routines_integration_4th_catch_43_layer_empirical_bootstrap_b0448_2026-<date>.md
```

Following the standard memory frontmatter format:

```markdown
---
name: cloud-routines-integration-4th-catch-43-layer-empirical-bootstrap
description: Cloud Routines integration — empirical bootstrap learnings from first fire (B-0448)
metadata:
  type: project

## What was learned (per B-0511 empirical fire)

[Fill from B-0511 findings]

## Registration surface

[Exact steps confirmed — no guessing required for future re-registration]

## Trigger syntax confirmed

[Per B-0507 research]

## Quota behavior observed

[Per-day counts, event-trigger counting rules]

## Project-knowledge bootstrap requirements

[Was bootstream required? How was it uploaded?]

## Failure modes encountered

[Any gotchas during registration or first fire]

## Composes with

- [[tick-must-never-stop]] — the failure mode this layer addresses
- [[otto-inter-surface-communication-channels]] — 4th layer addition to the channel inventory

**Why:** [[wake-time-substrate]] discipline requires empirical learnings to land as
direct-load substrate (rule or memory-with-pointer). The operational bootstrap
experience of the factory's first Cloud Routine is load-bearing for all future
instance onboarding.

**How to apply:** When a new maintainer machine or Cloud Routine needs re-registration,
this memory file provides the confirmed procedure without requiring B-0507 research
to be repeated.
```

## MEMORY.md index update

Add a one-line pointer to MEMORY.md under the autonomous-loop / routines section:

```markdown
- [Cloud Routines bootstrap learnings](feedback_cloud_routines_integration_4th_catch_43_layer_empirical_bootstrap_b0448_2026-<date>.md) — empirical first-fire learnings; re-registration procedure
```

## Rule consideration

If the Cloud Routines integration surfaces a new cold-boot discipline
(e.g., "always check if Cloud Routine is registered on session start"),
a `.claude/rules/` rule should be filed as well. This is at the implementing
agent's discretion after observing the first fire.

## Pre-start checklist

Per `.claude/rules/backlog-item-start-gate.md`:

- [ ] B-0511 closed — first empirical fire observed and documented
- [ ] Review B-0511's tick shard for raw observations to synthesize
- [ ] Check MEMORY.md for any Cloud Routines entries already present

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Memory file authored at path above
- [ ] Frontmatter correct (name, description, type: project, created date)
- [ ] Body covers all 6 sub-sections in the template
- [ ] MEMORY.md pointer added
- [ ] If rule warranted: `.claude/rules/<name>.md` filed (optional, at discretion)
- [ ] B-0448 parent row updated to `status: closed` with all 7 slice PR links
- [ ] B-0513 closed with PR link

## Why this is a separate slice

Memory-file authoring has a different failure mode than implementation:
it requires the empirical first-fire data to exist, and it's easy to skip
when a feature "works." Filing it as a separate slice ensures it's tracked
as explicit deliverable work, not an afterthought.

Per `.claude/rules/substrate-or-it-didnt-happen.md`: learnings that live
only in tick shards are weather. This slice converts the weather to substrate.
