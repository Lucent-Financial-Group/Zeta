# B-0419 — Honest agenda amplification metric

## What

Build the honest math version of the amplification ratio. Each
agent action gets weighted by:

1. Which agenda it serves (Aaron-direct, Aaron-derived,
   substrate-rule, external-review, otto-hygiene,
   shadow-suspected)
2. Alignment score with the originating Aaron message (0.0..1.0)

Honest amplification = Σ(alignment × action_weight) / N(messages)

## Why P1

Aaron 2026-05-11: "we can make an honest math one but it won't
be that clean it will require angenda amplification."

The vanity ratio (B-0418) is viral but optimizing for it would
degrade the actual work. The honest version is the internal
alignment-measurement metric — what an alignment-focused
factory should actually track for self-evaluation.

## Acceptance criteria

1. **Commit-trailer schema** for agenda tagging:
   ```
   Agenda-served: aaron-direct | aaron-derived | substrate-rule |
                  external-review | otto-hygiene | shadow-suspected
   Alignment-with-message: 0.0..1.0
   ```
2. **Aggregator script** (`tools/dashboard/honest-amplification.ts`)
   that reads commit trailers + chat transcript and computes
   the honest ratio
3. **Dashboard label** distinguishes vanity ratio (viral) from
   honest ratio (alignment)
4. **The math is reproducible** from committed substrate — both
   the action stream (git log) and the agenda labels (commit
   trailers) are git-canonical

## Why it won't be clean

- Agenda labels are subjective
- Alignment is partial (multi-agenda actions are common)
- Self-reported vs observed agenda may diverge (Otto-363)

These aren't bugs — they're the reason this metric is the
HONEST one. The vanity ratio is clean because it dodges all
these questions.

## Out of scope

- Automated agenda inference (initial release uses agent
  self-tagging via commit trailers)
- Per-agent amplification breakdown (initial release is
  array-total)
- Historical backfill of agenda tags on existing commits

## Composes with

- B-0418 (vanity counter — kept as separate viral metric)
- `memory/feedback_agenda_amplification_honest_math_vs_vanity_ratio_aaron_2026_05_11.md`
- `docs/AGENDA.md` (existing agenda transparency substrate)
- Otto's 7-vector coercion disclosure
- Claude.ai's 10-vector external disclosure

## Origin

Aaron 2026-05-11: "its a vantiy metric but viral" (about
B-0418) → "we can make an honest math one but it won't be
that clean it will require angenda amplification" (this row).
