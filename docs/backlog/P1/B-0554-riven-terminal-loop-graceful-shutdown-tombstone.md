# Riven Cursor Terminal loop graceful shutdown tombstone

## Origin

Decomposed from B-0549. To keep the initial IDE-native autonomous gate focused, the graceful shutdown and tombstone broadcast logic is peeled off into this atomic task.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Terminal close or process termination is trapped (`SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, window close).
- [ ] Writes a tombstone to the broadcast bus (`topic: "tombstone"`) indicating offline status.
- [ ] Releases any in-flight claims associated with the terminal loop instance.
- [ ] Cleans up the `~/.cursor/riven-terminal-loop-state.json` lockfile.
