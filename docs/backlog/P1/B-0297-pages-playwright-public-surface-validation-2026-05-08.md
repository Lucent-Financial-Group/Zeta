# B-0297 - Pages Playwright validation

Add browser-level validation for the published GitHub Pages
surface so discovery regressions fail in automation instead of
being found by a crawler or visitor.

## Acceptance criteria

- Playwright covers the public Pages URL with an HTTP 200 check.
- Navigation links used by the public landing flow are exercised.
- Metadata, `sitemap.xml`, and `robots.txt` are validated once
  those files are published.
- Mobile viewport coverage catches layout or overflow regressions
  on the primary Pages surface.
