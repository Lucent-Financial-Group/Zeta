# B-0329 — Mechanize new-surface audit for alignment-clause consistency

## Origin

Decomposed from B-0058 item 2: "New-surface audit".

## What this slice owns

Implementation of a cadence or CI check ensuring that:
Every new skill under `.claude/skills/**`, persona under `.claude/agents/**`, glossary entry in `docs/GLOSSARY.md`, and BACKLOG row at P0/P1 runs through an alignment-clause consistency check against `docs/ALIGNMENT.md` (HC-1..HC-7 / SD-1..SD-8 / DIR-1..DIR-5).

This check must fire at author-time (prevention surface) and on a cadence (detection surface). It follows the same shape as the skill-data/behaviour-split audit, but verifies alignment-clause compliance rather than mix-signature.

## Next Steps

1. Create a `tools/hygiene/audit-new-surface-alignment.ts` script.
2. Hook it into the razor-cadence or GitHub Actions.
