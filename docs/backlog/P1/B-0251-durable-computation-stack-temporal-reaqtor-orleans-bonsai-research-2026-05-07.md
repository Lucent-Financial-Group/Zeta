# B-0251 — Durable computation stack research

## What

Close the `DurabilityMode.StableStorage` gap in
`src/Core/Durability.fs` by studying and composing
8 systems that solve durable computation at different
layers:

| System | Layer | Open source |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Bonsai/Nuqleon | Expression tree serialization | MIT (reaqtive/reaqtor) |
| Temporal | Durable execution (event-history replay) | MIT (temporalio) |
| Reaqtor | Stateful Rx operators (checkpoint/restore) | MIT (.NET Foundation) |
| Orleans | Virtual actors (grain identity + persistence) | MIT (dotnet/orleans) |
| Azure Durable Functions | Microsoft managed durable workflows | MIT (azure/azure-functions-durable-extension) |
| AWS Step Functions | Amazon managed state machines | Proprietary |
| Google Dataflow/Beam | Streaming with windowing | Apache 2.0 |
| TPL Dataflow / Mailbox | .NET in-process dataflow | MIT (.NET runtime) |

## Why these compose (not compete)

- **Bonsai** = serialize the query definition (expression tree → compact JSON/binary)
- **Temporal** = make execution durable (event history replay; deterministic re-execution)
- **Reaqtor** = make Rx operators stateful (checkpoint/restore at operator boundaries)
- **Orleans** = address and locate the computation (grain = subscriber; silo = node)
- **TPL Dataflow** = in-process pipeline (mailbox pattern)

## The DBSP unification

DBSP's Z-set algebra unifies the streaming and workflow
models because Z-sets are both the event stream AND the
state:

- `D` (differentiate) converts state → stream
- `I` (integrate) converts stream → state
- They're inverses: `I(D(x)) = x`

This means:
- **Temporal's event-history replay** = replaying the Z-set
  stream through the deterministic circuit
- **Reaqtor's operator checkpoint** = serializing the `I`
  (integrated state) at operator boundaries
- **Orleans grain persistence** = the grain IS the integrated
  state of one standing query
- **Bonsai** = how to serialize the circuit topology itself

## The gap in src/Core/Durability.fs

```fsharp
type DurabilityMode =
    | StableStorage    // "advertised but not fulfilled"
    | OsBuffered       // works
    | InMemoryOnly     // works
    | WitnessDurable   // research skeleton
```

`StableStorage` is defined but throws at runtime. The
checkpoint boundary already exists: `Circuit.StepAsync`
is the yield point. The owed work:

1. After each `StepAsync`, optionally serialize operator state
2. Persist the Z-set input stream for replay
3. On recovery, replay from last checkpoint

## Aaron's lineage on this

- dotnet/orleans #4985 (2018) — "Durability Guarantees"
- dotnet/orleans #3608 (2017) — "Productizing Orleans"
- dotnet/orleans #2580 (2017) — "Separate health checks from membership"
- Azure/Azure-Functions #2451 (2024) — Dapr Workflow vs Durable Functions hops
- microsoft/durabletask-go #64 (2024) — Durable Entities support
- Zeta src/Core/Rx.fs — already bridges Circuit → IObservable with Reaqtor references

## Candidate atomic children

- Study Temporal .NET SDK interface (`temporalio/sdk-dotnet`)
- Study Reaqtor IStatefulOperator checkpoint pattern
- Study Bonsai expression tree serialization for circuit topology
- Study Orleans grain persistence for standing query state
- Implement StableStorage backing store with fsync
- Implement checkpoint at StepAsync boundary
- Implement Z-set stream persistence for replay
- Wire RxAdapter.asObservable to checkpoint-aware circuit
- Test: crash recovery from checkpoint
- Test: deterministic replay produces identical state
