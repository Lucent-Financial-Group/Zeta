# B-0467 — Product-repo cross-ref glue mechanism design

## What this row does

Design the **cross-repo reference mechanism** for product repos — how product repos
(KSK / wellness / civsim / etc.) reference Zeta, Forge, and ace as upstream deps.

This is the product-side equivalent of the peer-repo cross-referencing already
designed for Zeta ↔ Forge ↔ ace in the three-repo split ADR. Products are CONSUMERS
of the factory-infrastructure repos, not peers in the Ouroboros cycle.

## Depends on

- **B-0465** — need to know which products get repos; design must work for all of them
- **B-0424** — the established glue pattern (peer repos, version-pin files,
  `repository_dispatch` CI triggers) must be understood before extending it

## The design problem

The three-repo split (Zeta + Forge + ace) uses **peer repos with cross-referencing**
to handle the Ouroboros cycle. Product repos have a simpler, one-directional
relationship: they consume Zeta/Forge/ace but don't need to be consumed back.

Key questions this row resolves:

1. **Version pinning**: Do product repos pin to a Zeta semver, a git SHA, or a
   future `ace pull zeta@<ver>` command?
2. **CI triggers**: When Zeta ships a breaking change, which CI signal updates
   product repo dependencies? Is there a `repository_dispatch` pattern from Zeta
   to product repos? Or do products use Dependabot / Renovate?
3. **Agent/factory colocation**: Product repos likely need `.claude/` configuration.
   Does each product repo get its own agent persona stack, or does it reference
   Forge for factory tools?
4. **Testing across repos**: Does KSK (robotics) need to run Zeta integration tests
   against its own actuator-control substrate? How does that CI work?
5. **Branch protection parity**: Same pattern as Forge/ace? Or lighter weight for
   products?

## Design options

### Option A — Version-pin files (same as Zeta ↔ Forge today)

Product repos get a `.zeta-version` file pinning a Zeta git SHA or semver tag.
CI in the product repo reads the pin on install. Forge CI publishes a
`repository_dispatch` event when a new Zeta release tags.

**Pros**: consistent with existing B-0424 pattern; no new tooling needed  
**Cons**: manual pin-file bumps until ace ships; may diverge across 7 products

### Option B — Dependabot / Renovate tracking NuGet/npm packages

Products consume Zeta via a NuGet package (`Zeta.Core.*`). Dependabot auto-bumps
the package reference. No bespoke pin-file mechanism needed.

**Pros**: industry-standard; zero bespoke tooling  
**Cons**: requires NuGet publish cadence for Zeta; product repos can't use unreleased
Zeta features

### Option C — ace mediation (target state)

`ace pull zeta@<ver>` is the canonical version-pin mechanism once ace ships.
Product repos get an `ace.toml` + lockfile instead of a `.zeta-version` pin file.

**Pros**: Ouroboros bootstraps at product scope; ace becomes the universal glue  
**Cons**: ace doesn't exist yet (B-0424 Stage 3 is multi-year deferred)

### Recommended path: Option A now → Option B for packaged releases → Option C when ace ships

Default to **both** (per `.claude/rules/default-to-both.md`): product repos that
are product-deliverable use NuGet references (Option B); repos that track Zeta's
development edge use version-pin files (Option A). Option C is the long-term target.

## Output format

A new design section in `docs/DECISIONS/2026-04-22-three-repo-split-zeta-forge-ace.md`
(extend the existing ADR, or create a companion ADR):
`docs/DECISIONS/2026-05-14-product-repo-glue-mechanism.md`

Structure:

- Decision context (product-vs-factory-repo shape difference)
- Three options evaluated (A/B/C)
- Decision: recommended staged approach
- Per-product notes (KSK CI/CD has special actuator-control considerations;
  civsim's strategic encryption composes with the pin mechanism; etc.)
- "When ace ships" migration path

## Definition of done

- Decision document created
- Three options documented with pros/cons
- Recommended staged approach chosen with rationale
- Per-product notes for any special cases (KSK robotics CI, civsim encryption)
- B-0468 (ADR) can reference this decision
