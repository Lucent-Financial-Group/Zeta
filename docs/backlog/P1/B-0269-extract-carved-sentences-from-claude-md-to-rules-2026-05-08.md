# B-0269 — Extract carved sentences to rules

If B-0268 confirms auto-load works: move carved-sentence
bullets from CLAUDE.md to individual .claude/rules/<rule>.md
files. Each rule = one carved sentence + rationale pointer.

If B-0268 fails: this row becomes "alternative spillover
surface" research.

## Acceptance criteria

- At least 5 carved sentences extracted from CLAUDE.md
- Each in its own .claude/rules/<name>.md
- CLAUDE.md shrinks by the extracted content
- Build + tests still pass
