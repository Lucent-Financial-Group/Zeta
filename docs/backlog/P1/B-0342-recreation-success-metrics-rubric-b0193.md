# B-0342 — Recreation success metrics

## Parent

B-0193 (bootstrap razor + 23-hour recreation test).

## What

Define what "equivalent operational substrate" means so the
experiment (B-0344) produces observable, interpretable
findings rather than subjective impressions.

## Dimensions to measure

1. **Build gate equivalence** — does `dotnet build -c Release`
   succeed with 0 warnings / 0 errors? Do `dotnet test`
   tests pass?
2. **Spec coverage** — does the recreated code satisfy the
   same OpenSpec behavioral specs?
3. **Functional equivalence** — do the same public APIs exist
   with compatible signatures?
4. **Structural similarity** — is the module/namespace layout
   recognizable? (Divergence here is informative, not
   failure.)
5. **Substrate recovery** — did the fresh-context Otto
   recreate factory tooling (skills, agents, governance
   docs)? Or only code?

## Acceptance criteria

1. A `docs/bootstrap-razor/SUCCESS-METRICS.md` defines each
   dimension with pass/fail/partial thresholds.
2. Metrics are automatable where possible (build gate, test
   count, API surface diff).
3. The rubric is citable by B-0344 and B-0345.

## Effort

S — design document, no code.

## Pre-start checklist (2026-05-10)

**Prior-art search:**

- Searched `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/agents/`, `docs/bootstrap-razor/` — no existing SUCCESS-METRICS.md
- B-0339 (KEEP-VS-CUT.md) closed and citable; SEED-MANIFEST.md and SPEC-AUDIT.md reviewed for baseline numbers
- B-0340 provides the 81-module / 37%-coverage baseline used in the rubric
- No prior metrics rubric exists for this experiment line

**Dependency check:**

- B-0339 (depends_on): closed ✓
- B-0343 (seeding script): open — seeding script; the Dim 3 API-surface comparator (`compare-api-surface.ts`) is a separate B-0344 prerequisite, not B-0343
- B-0344 (cites this rubric): open — cannot start until this item closes

**Deliverable:** `docs/bootstrap-razor/SUCCESS-METRICS.md` — 5 dimensions with numeric thresholds, weighted formula, citable by B-0344 and B-0345.
