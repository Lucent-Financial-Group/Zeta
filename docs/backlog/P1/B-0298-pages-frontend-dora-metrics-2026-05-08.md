# B-0298 - Pages frontend DORA metrics

Define the DORA measurement layer for the GitHub Pages
deployment path without creating a second observability
substrate.

## Acceptance criteria

- Deployment frequency is defined for the Pages publishing lane.
- Lead time is measured from merged change to live Pages
  availability.
- MTTR and change failure rate definitions include Pages-specific
  rollback or repair events.
- The metrics path composes with the existing timeseries lane.
