# Human-lineage / external-anchor backfill across all substrate

Backfill external prior-art anchors (papers, RFCs, blog posts,
Stack Overflow / Stack Exchange threads, conference talks,
public agent-design discussions) for every load-bearing
substrate concept in the factory. Goal: every load-bearing
concept has either (a) a cited human-authored external anchor
OR (b) an explicit "no prior art found, this is original" note
(so absence is itself documented).

## Why

Two load-bearing observations:

1. **Editing Markdown for AI substrate IS coding.** The
   substrate doc-writing (memories, BP rules, Otto-NN named
   principles, Glass-Halo doctrine) is a form of software
   engineering. Software engineering has decades of public
   prior art. Ignoring that prior art means re-deriving what's
   already known and missing pitfalls others have documented.
2. **Beacon-safe + human-anchored.** Per Otto-351 (Beacon
   naming + lineage rigor), substrate concepts gain
   credibility from human-authored anchoring. A concept named
   "Otto-NNN" is internal-vocabulary; the same concept cited
   to a paper / RFC / conference talk gains external lineage
   that survives the project's lifetime + is teachable to
   external collaborators.

## Phasing proposal

**Phase 1 — audit (M effort, 1 round):**
Enumerate substrate concepts that DO and DON'T have external
anchors today. Output: a coverage table mapping each concept
to either a citation list or an "anchor-pending" marker.
Targets to enumerate:

- HC-1..HC-7 / SD-1..SD-9 / DIR-1..DIR-5 alignment clauses
  (`docs/ALIGNMENT.md`)
- Otto-NN named principles (~360 entries; the per-Otto-NN
  mapping is already tracked as task #288 — Otto-349
  per-Otto-NN ↔ named-principle mapping, BACKLOG-deferred)
- BP-NN best-practice rules (`docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md`)
- Glass-Halo substrate doctrines (radical honesty, total-
  observability, etc.)
- Aurora doctrine concepts (Immune Governance Layer, ferry
  protocol, KSK, etc.)
- Memory files under `memory/` (~1500 entries)
- Research reports under `docs/research/`

**Phase 2 — high-priority backfill (L effort, 2-3 rounds):**
Anchor the load-bearing concepts first. Priority ordering:

1. HC-/SD-/DIR- alignment clauses (most-cited; Beacon-safe
   matters most here for external collaborators)
2. Otto-NN named principles that compose into wake-time
   disciplines (Otto-247 / Otto-275 / Otto-279 / Otto-341 /
   Otto-351 / Otto-352 / Otto-357)
3. BP-NN rules that fire in CI / pre-commit hooks
4. Glass-Halo doctrines visible on the public-facing
   surfaces (README, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md)

**Phase 3 — long-tail (cadenced, ongoing):**
Memory-file coverage on a cadence (e.g., every 10th memory
file in a sweep). Covered by an existing backlog row for
periodic memory-index audits.

## Done-criteria

For each load-bearing substrate concept:

- [ ] Coverage table entry exists.
- [ ] Either (a) at least one cited external anchor (paper /
      RFC / blog / Stack Overflow / Stack Exchange / public
      talk / conference proceedings) OR (b) explicit
      "no prior art found, original to Zeta" note.
- [ ] Anchor checked for Beacon-safety: the cited source's
      vocabulary doesn't collide with Beacon-blocked
      terminology (per Otto-351 + the prompt-protector
      review).

## Composes with

- **B-0003** — ALIGNMENT.md rewrite. Phase 2 anchoring of
  HC/SD/DIR clauses lands cleanly during the rewrite.
- **Otto-352** — external-anchor-lineage discipline already
  applied to the live-lock 5-class taxonomy. This row
  generalises it to all substrate.
- **`feedback_search_internet_when_self_fixing_*`** — the
  parent rule for *new* self-fixing rules. This row does the
  *backfill* for *existing* substrate.
- **Otto-351** — Beacon naming + lineage + rigor work.
  External anchors raise the rigor floor.

## Reviewers

- `alignment-auditor` — for HC/SD/DIR coverage signal.
- `threat-model-critic` — for security-substrate coverage.
- The human maintainer — for Beacon-safe-language pass on
  any anchor that surfaces vocabulary the project has chosen
  to avoid.
