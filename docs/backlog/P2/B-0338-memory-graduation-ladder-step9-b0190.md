# B-0338 — Memory graduation ladder

## Parent

B-0190 Step 9 (memory-as-substrate-engineering meta-discipline).

## What

Codify the graduation ladder for memory content:

1. **When to write a new memory file vs append to an existing
   one** — criteria for new-file vs extend-existing.
2. **When a feedback_ file gets promoted to a CLAUDE.md bullet**
   — the threshold: wake-time-load-bearing + recognition-failure
   component (per Claude Code loading taxonomy memo).
3. **When a CLAUDE.md bullet gets promoted to GOVERNANCE.md** —
   the threshold: applies to all harnesses + numbered-rule
   stability.
4. **When a CLAUDE.md bullet gets demoted back to memory** — the
   threshold: no longer wake-time-load-bearing (e.g., the lesson
   has been mechanized into a tool/hook).

## Why depends on B-0330, B-0332, B-0333

- B-0330 (format) — the ladder references format conventions.
- B-0332 (load-bearing classifier) — "load-bearing" is the
  promotion criterion.
- B-0333 (retire discipline) — demotion is the inverse of
  retirement.

## Why P2

Meta-discipline that structures future work. The factory operates
without explicit graduation rules today (CLAUDE.md bullets are
added ad hoc). This codifies what's currently implicit.

## Output

A section added to `memory/README.md` or a standalone
`memory/project_graduation_ladder.md` file.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Graduation ladder documented.
2. Ladder covers all four transitions above.
3. At least 2 existing CLAUDE.md bullets identified as candidates
   for demotion (mechanized into tools) as a smoke check.

## Prior art

- CLAUDE.md "wake-time substrate or it didn't land" bullet —
  describes the promotion criterion implicitly.
- `memory/feedback_claude_code_loading_taxonomy_rules_vs_skills_vs_claude_md_aaron_2026_05_01.md`
  — loading taxonomy that informs promotion decisions.
