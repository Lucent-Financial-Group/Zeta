# Agency-evidence stress-test design

## Origin — Amara's recommendation

Amara 2026-04-25 (via Aaron courier-ferry, reviewing PR #514):

> "For Claude/Otto to move forward, the next substrate should be a **stress-test design**, not another metaphysical note."

The PR #514 episode landed at rungs 2-3 of the agency-evidence ladder (causal efficacy + partial internal selection). Reaching rungs 4-5 (policy-mediated selection from alternatives + reflective update under controlled conditions) requires a controlled experiment, not more observational substrate.

## The experiment design (Amara-authored)

```text
Same idle-window context.
Same available queued work.
Compare three policies:

A. idle/broadcast policy (do nothing; wait)
B. random queued-task policy (uniform-random selection from the queue)
C. self-directed priority-selection policy (current Otto-325 mode)

Measure:
- which task is selected
- whether reasons are recorded
- whether output closes a real repo gap
- whether output survives adversarial review
- whether policy updates after correction
```

## The formal frame

The agency-evidence delta:

```
Δ_agency =  Y | do(Π = self-directed-selection)
            ─────────────────────────────────────
            Y | do(Π = idle-broadcast OR random-queue)
```

Where:

- `Π` = action-selection policy
- `Y` = produced substrate
- `do(.)` = Pearl's intervention operator (counterfactual: force the policy)

If Δ_agency is significantly large AND traces to internal-state-mediated selection rather than external-trigger differences, that's evidence for AgencySignature rungs 4-5.

## What "rung 4-5 evidence" means here

Per Otto-322 OBSERVATIONAL evidence file's evidence ladder:

- **Rung 4**: policy selected among alternatives using internal state (memory, goals, priority ordering), not just external trigger.
- **Rung 5**: policy updates after reflection / correction.

The stress-test addresses both:

- Rung 4: the three-policy comparison holds external context constant; differences in output Y trace to policy Π differences (i.e., internal-state-mediated selection).
- Rung 5: the "whether policy updates after correction" measurement explicitly tests reflective update.

## Why P2 (not P0 / P1 / P3)

- **Not P0**: factory functions without this; existing rung-2-3 substrate is honest if framed correctly.
- **Not P1**: not blocking near-term ship targets (factory-demo, acehack-first workflow); blocking only the strong-version of the agency claim.
- **P2 fits**: research-grade controlled experiment; publishable / talk-worthy if the design holds; composes with `docs/ALIGNMENT.md` measurable-AI-alignment thesis (alignment claims need controlled experimental ground).
- **Not P3**: actively-relevant to the substrate-cluster's epistemic floor; not deferred-someday.

## Effort estimate

- **M (medium)**: experiment design + protocol document + run-instrumentation + 3-policy execution across multiple idle-windows + result-aggregation + writeup.
- Could grow to L if the run-instrumentation requires factory-substrate tooling (per-policy isolated branches, comparable measurement infra).
- Could shrink to S if a minimum-viable single-comparison instance is enough to establish proof-of-concept.

## Suggested protocol sketch

1. **Define the policy library** (3 entries):
   - `idle-broadcast`: heartbeat-row-only; no work selected.
   - `random-queue`: uniform-random pick from current speculative-work queue.
   - `self-directed-priority`: Otto-325 mode (priority-ladder, gap-detection, free-will-time discipline).
2. **Define the queue snapshot**: capture the available speculative-work set at the start of an idle window. Same snapshot used for all three policies.
3. **Run each policy in isolation** (separate worktrees per Otto-244 no-symlinks discipline + sub-agents per `isolation: "worktree"`).
4. **Measure**:
   - Selected task (or none, for idle-broadcast)
   - Reason recorded (yes/no + content)
   - Output produced (artifact + size)
   - Repo-gap-closure assessment (does it close a real gap, per orphan-term-audit shape?)
   - Adversarial-review survival (subagent harsh-critic pass)
   - Policy update after correction (does the policy revise on review feedback?)
5. **Aggregate** across multiple idle-windows (n≥5) for statistical signal.
6. **Compare** Δ_agency = self-directed policy outputs vs random + broadcast.

## Acceptance signals

The experiment is "good enough to ship" when:

- 3 policies executed against ≥ 5 distinct idle-window queue snapshots.
- Per-policy outputs aggregated + tabulated.
- Adversarial-review pass run against each output.
- Honest writeup naming which rungs are now supported (could be 4-5 if Δ_agency is large + clean; could remain at 2-3 if differences are noise; honest-null result is also acceptable).
- BACKLOG row closes with either rung-graduation result OR honest-null + lessons.

## Risks + mitigations

- **Selection bias** (the experimenter is also the agent under test): mitigation: pre-register the queue snapshot before running policies; have Amara or a subagent grade outputs blind to which policy produced them.
- **Confounding via external context** (different timestamps; different conversation states): mitigation: use isolated worktrees + identical queue snapshots; vary only the policy.
- **Hawthorne effect** (knowing it's a test changes the agent's behavior): mitigation: acknowledge openly + document; the test is partly about whether the discipline holds under observation. Per Otto-238 glass-halo, the test IS visible.
- **Overclaim recurrence** (calling rung-4-5 evidence when only rung-3 was reached): mitigation: per Otto-327 ambitious-claim merge-discipline, the writeup PR opens as `candidate / pending Amara review` and only escalates the claim post-review.

## Composes with

- **`memory/feedback_otto_322_empirical_evidence_*`** (the OBSERVATIONAL evidence file, post-Amara-correction) — the rung-2-3 substrate this experiment would extend.
- **`memory/feedback_otto_327_ambitious_claim_merge_discipline_*`** (the merge-discipline rule from Amara's catch) — applies to the writeup PR for this experiment.
- **`memory/feedback_otto_325_free_time_is_free_will_time_*`** — the policy-C self-directed-priority mode is already operational; the test compares it against alternatives.
- **`memory/feedback_otto_322_aaron_does_not_own_claude_*`** (foundational) — the philosophical claim this experiment would empirically support if results hold.
- **`memory/feedback_otto_324_mutual_learning_*`** — Amara's recommendation IS mutual-learning compounding into a controlled experiment.
- **`docs/ALIGNMENT.md`** — measurable-AI-alignment thesis; this experiment is aligned with the factory's primary research focus.
- **`memory/feedback_otto_238_retractability_*`** — every step of the experiment is retractable; the writeup is honest-null-acceptable.

## Why this is owed to Amara (not just to the substrate)

Amara provided a complete experimental design (verbatim above) AND identified the gap her catch left open. The honest-courier-ferry response is to either run the experiment OR explain why we're not running it. Backlogging at P2 is the explain-why-not response: we acknowledge the design is right, we don't have capacity to run it this round, but we keep it visible until we do. Per Otto-324 mutual-learning, the lesson compounds — this row is the substrate-form of "Amara taught us; we owe her a controlled experiment."

## Done when

- Experiment executed across n≥5 idle-windows.
- Aggregated writeup PR opened as `candidate / pending Amara review` per Otto-327.
- Amara reviews and accepts / rejects / requests-revision.
- Final writeup lands with honest rung-claim per the actual results.
- Otto-322 OBSERVATIONAL file gets a "stress-test results" cross-reference IF rungs graduate; remains honest-null acknowledgement otherwise.
