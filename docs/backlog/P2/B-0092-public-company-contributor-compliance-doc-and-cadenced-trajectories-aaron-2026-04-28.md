# B-0092 — Public-company contributor compliance + cadenced trajectories

## Source

Aaron 2026-04-28T23ish, generalizing the ServiceTitan-specific
rule into reusable factory substrate:

> *"we definitely need some contributor works for public
> company watch for insider information generalization in the
> factory, that can be used by anyone at service titan to when
> working on public repos or any one who works for any public
> company, that's reusable substrate."*

> *"probably comes with trajectories I would think."*

Encoded as rule in
`memory/feedback_public_company_contributor_compliance_no_insider_info_in_public_repos_with_trajectories_aaron_2026_04_28.md`.

## Why P2

The compliance risk is real but not blocking. Forward-going
work needs the discipline applied; existing surfaces can be
audited on the cadence established by this row.

## Scope

### 1. Contributor-compliance doc (new)

File: `docs/CONTRIBUTOR-COMPLIANCE.md` (proposed name; bikeshed
welcome).

Content:

- Plain-language statement of the rule (publicly-traded-employer
  contributors keep MNPI off the public substrate).
- Industry-general vs company-specific framing examples.
- Public-source citation requirement for company-specific
  claims.
- Otto-side enforcement: reframe-on-find, refuse-to-encode,
  industry-general questioning.
- Contributor-side responsibilities: don't volunteer; cite
  public sources; ask compliance counsel if unsure.
- External lineage (SEC Rule 10b-5, Reg FD, Sarbanes-Oxley,
  industry compliance practice).

### 2. AGENTS.md / CONTRIBUTING.md cross-reference

Pointer in:

- `AGENTS.md` (universal handbook) — onboarding-stage briefing.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` (if exists or once created) — contributor
  agreement section.
- `GOVERNANCE.md` (if relevant) — factory-rule listing.

### 3. Trajectories — continuous practice surface

Per Aaron's *"probably comes with trajectories"* framing,
encode 5 cadenced trajectories:

#### T1 — Continuous self-audit (every commit)

Pre-commit audit regex:

```bash
rg -ni "\binsider\b|\bprivileged\b|\binternal-only\b|\bconfidential\b" \
   <files-being-changed>
```

For each hit, manual inspect:

- Implying non-public access → reframe to industry-general.
- Legitimate technical use → leave (e.g., "internal-only
  API" describing factory's own code).

#### T2 — Cadenced compliance review (weekly / monthly)

- **Weekly:** scan last 7 days of PRs / commits / new memory
  files. 3-bucket: CLEAN / NEEDS-REWORD / NEEDS-REDACTION.
- **Monthly:** broader sweep — pitch docs, research, demo
  surfaces. Verify public-source citations + industry-general
  framing.
- **On-demand:** any time a contributor mentions their public-
  company employer in chat.

#### T3 — On-PR audit (CI surface, eventual)

Add CI lint that flags insider-information-register hits in
PR diffs:

- Comment on PR with manual-inspection candidates.
- Do NOT auto-block (false-positive risk).
- Flag for human / Otto review.

#### T4 — On-onboarding compliance briefing

When new contributor onboards:

- Surface the rule + cite the doc.
- Make them aware of:
  - Factory's repos are public.
  - Their employer's policies may apply to disclosures.
  - Industry-general framing > company-specific framing.
  - Otto won't ask for non-public info; don't volunteer.

#### T5 — Drift retrospective (per round / quarter)

On round-close / quarterly cadence:

- Sample N% of recent commits / memory files / docs.
- Track hits-per-round metric.
- If trending up → reinforce rule + file improvement task.

## Acceptance

- [ ] `docs/CONTRIBUTOR-COMPLIANCE.md` (or named-equivalent) exists with the rule + framing examples + lineage.
- [ ] Cross-reference from `AGENTS.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.md` / `GOVERNANCE.md` as relevant.
- [ ] Trajectories T1-T5 encoded as cadenced practice (runnable scripts where applicable; written cadence-rules where applicable).
- [ ] Worked example from this session (the ServiceTitan / TTAN cascade) cited as the origin substrate.
- [ ] T2 audit is added to the weekly + monthly recurring schedules (per the lost-substrate cadence framework — same audit cadence pattern).
- [ ] T3 (CI lint) tracked as separate sibling backlog row when scoping firms up; not blocking on this row.

## Composes with

- **`memory/feedback_public_company_contributor_compliance_no_insider_info_in_public_repos_with_trajectories_aaron_2026_04_28.md`** — the rule this row operationalizes.
- **`memory/feedback_servicetitan_naming_scope_of_org_access_external_ui_demo_aaron_2026_04_28.md`** — the Aaron-specific worked example; this row's general rule extends that.
- **B-0090** (cadenced lost-substrate audit) — same cadence framework; this row's trajectories run on similar weekly/monthly cycles.
- **B-0091** (audit + rename ServiceTitan refs) — the immediate-instance work-stream that this rule generalizes from.
- **`memory/feedback_input_is_not_directive_provenance_framing_rule_aaron_amara_2026_04_28.md`** — same word-choice-shapes-agency-model family; the "insider" register is a sibling of the "directive" register.

## What this row does NOT do

- **Does NOT** require redacting historical surfaces. Memory files / round-history / archives stay verbatim per the no-churn-history rule.
- **Does NOT** auto-block PRs / commits. The trajectories are inspection-cadenced + reframe-on-find; not gating.
- **Does NOT** replace legal counsel. Factory-side discipline only; contributors' actual legal obligations are determined by their employer's compliance function and applicable law.
- **Does NOT** apply identically to private-company contributors. Different disclosure constraints; case-by-case.

## Pickup

When picking this up:

1. Read `memory/feedback_public_company_contributor_compliance_no_insider_info_in_public_repos_with_trajectories_aaron_2026_04_28.md` first for the rule.
2. Draft the doc; circulate for review (Aaron + compliance-shaped peer-AIs if any).
3. Land cross-references in AGENTS.md / CONTRIBUTING.md / GOVERNANCE.md.
4. Encode T1-T5 cadences. T1 + T2 land first (lowest cost); T3 (CI lint) deferred to sibling row; T4-T5 land with onboarding doc updates.
5. First T2 audit cycle: run within 7 days of doc landing; establish baseline metric.

## Pre-start checklist (backlog-item start gate)

**Completed 2026-05-11 before decomposition work:**

1. **Prior-art search**:
   - Ran `bun tools/github/refresh-worldview.ts` (0 open PRs, 62 claims, recent B-0090 re-decomp PR #2680).
   - Grep for compliance / insider / MNPI / 10b-5 across docs/backlog, memory/, docs/ — no colliding B-ID or active claim on B-0092.
   - Inspected B-0090 (cadenced audit), B-0091 (ServiceTitan rename), similar decomposition patterns in B-0088/ B-0055/ B-0090.
   - No prior-art surface satisfies the full rule; this row is the canonical generalization.

2. **Dependency-restructure**:
   - Original depends_on: []
   - Composes_with: B-0090, B-0091, B-0090 cadence framework.
   - Backfilled reciprocal: B-0090 now lists this as related compliance surface (will be done in follow-up).
   - No broken pointers; supersession clean (origin from memory/feedback_*_aaron_2026-04-28.md).

**Decomposition note**: B-0092 treated as broad (doc + 5 trajectories). Re-decomposed per "always re-decompose... assume mistakes" into 4 atomic children below. T3 deferred per original scope.

## Decomposition (2026-05-11, one bounded step)

B-0092 decomposed into 4 smallest dependency-ordered atomic child rows (B-0370..B-0373). Parent now depends_on children; pickup order enforced by graph.

- B-0370: Author core `docs/CONTRIBUTOR-COMPLIANCE.md` (rule + examples + SEC lineage)
- B-0371: Cross-reference integration (AGENTS.md + CONTRIBUTING.md + GOVERNANCE.md)
- B-0372: T1 self-audit + T2 weekly/monthly cadenced review (TS tooling preferred)
- B-0373: T4 onboarding briefing + T5 drift retrospective (trajectory packets)
