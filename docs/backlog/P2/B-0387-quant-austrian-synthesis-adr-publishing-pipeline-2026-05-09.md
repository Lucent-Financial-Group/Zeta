# B-0387 — Synthesis ADR: quant × Austrian formalizability + open-research publishing pipeline

## What

Produce the capstone output for B-0023: an Architect decision record
(ADR) at `docs/aurora/YYYY-MM-DD-quant-austrian-synthesis-adr.md`
that integrates all five per-primitive verdicts (B-0382–B-0386) into:

1. **Formalizability matrix** — for each Austrian primitive:
   - Verdict (admits clean quant-grade formalization / partially /
     not cleanly)
   - Best-candidate framework (stochastic calculus / information
     theory / regime-switching / formal complexity)
   - Synthesis-gap remaining
   - Confidence level (high / medium / low) with justification

2. **Overall synthesis assessment**:
   - Which primitive(s) are the strongest formalization candidates?
     (B-0384 calculation-problem and B-0385 ABCT are hypothesized
     to be the strongest — the ADR either confirms or revises this)
   - Is the synthesis gap a *foundations-incompatibility problem*
     or a *literature gap* per B-0380 vocabulary? (This changes
     the research program direction entirely)
   - What does successful formalization buy Aurora? (Per B-0023
     §"Why Aurora-relevant": anti-deception, mechanism-not-
     correlation, falsifiability)

3. **Open-research publishing pipeline**:
   Per Aaron's "open source, real time" framing (B-0023 §Origin):
   - Where and how progressive research notes land (the
     `docs/aurora/` naming convention already established by
     B-0381–B-0386 primitive notes)
   - License / attribution discipline for the research output
     (already open-source by being in the public Zeta repo, but
     explicit Creative Commons / MIT attribution should be stated)
   - How to publish "partial findings + null results" as-we-go
     without waiting for synthesis completion — glass-halo at
     the research-output layer per Otto-332
   - Any external publication venue candidates (SSRN, arXiv
     economics section) if the research produces novel formalization

4. **What this row explicitly does NOT decide**:
   - Aurora's choice of economic framework (that is B-0021)
   - Whether Austrian economics is "correct" (this is
     a formalizability assessment, not an endorsement)
   - A completed formalization of any primitive (those are the
     research notes produced by B-0382–B-0386)

## Why last (and why P2 not P3)

All five per-primitive assessments must complete before the synthesis
verdict can integrate them. The synthesis verdict is the B-0023
"Done when" capstone. This is P2 (matching parent B-0023) because
it produces the output Aaron asked for; the per-primitive rows
are P3 because they are inputs.

The publishing pipeline is part of this row because Aaron explicitly
framed the publishing commitment as a load-bearing requirement
("let the world know, everything open source, in real time") —
it is not a postscript but a design constraint on how the research
is conducted.

## Output artifact

`docs/aurora/YYYY-MM-DD-quant-austrian-synthesis-adr.md` with:

- Formalizability matrix (5 rows × verdict + framework + gap + confidence)
- Overall synthesis assessment
- Open-research publishing pipeline design
- References to all five primitive notes and the survey

## Focused check

```bash
ls docs/aurora/ | grep synthesis-adr
```

Expected: the ADR file present with today's date prefix.

## Acceptance signal

- ADR committed under `docs/aurora/`
- Formalizability matrix complete (5 primitives)
- Foundations-incompatibility vs. literature-gap question answered
- Publishing pipeline explicitly designed (not just "publish as-we-go")
- External publication venue candidates listed
- B-0023 parent updated to `status: done` or `status: ongoing`
  depending on whether progressive publication is considered "done"

## Pre-start checklist

- [x] Prior-art search: no existing synthesis ADR in `docs/aurora/`
  or `docs/DECISIONS/`. B-0023 defines the shape; this row executes it.
- [x] Dependency-restructure: `depends_on: [B-0382, B-0383, B-0384,
  B-0385, B-0386]` — all five primitive verdicts required. Cannot
  start until all five primitive assessment notes are committed.

## Composes with

- B-0023 (parent): this is the "Done when" capstone — ADR landing
  here + progressive publication established closes B-0023
- B-0021 (grandparent axis): the ADR feeds B-0021's Aurora-specific
  econ-primitive identification (B-0021.5); the synthesis gives
  B-0021 the "which Austrian primitives are rigorously grounded"
  answer it needs
- B-0380–B-0386 (all deps): vocabulary and five primitive verdicts
