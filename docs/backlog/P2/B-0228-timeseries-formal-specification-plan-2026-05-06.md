# B-0228 - Timeseries formal-specification plan

Route the B-0147 formal-math requirement into specific
verification tools and proof obligations.

## Work scope

Decide which properties belong in TLA+, F# refinement /
types, Lean, Coq, Isabelle, or other existing Zeta
verification surfaces. Cover algebra correctness, CRDT
convergence, retraction duality, cardinality-adaptive
storage bounds, and time-monotonicity.

## Acceptance criteria

- Each proof obligation has a proposed verification surface.
- The plan composes with the existing formal-foundation rows
  instead of inventing a parallel proof stack.
- The plan identifies which properties are required before
  implementation and which can be validated after a prototype.
- The output feeds B-0230 and the eventual implementation
  rows filed by B-0231.
