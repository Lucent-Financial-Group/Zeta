## Why

Per Aaron 2026-05-16 (to Otto-CLI, after Kestrel conversation Parts 4-5):

> *"this is backlog too an intellignt compiler mabye at least we talked abou it recursive hkt on itself and recursive type proveders and roslyn source generators and linq for c#"*

The antigen-spread / multi-oracle / clearing-mechanism / moral-floor architecture (per `feedback_aaron_red_team_antigen_differential_spread_*`, `feedback_aaron_market_clearing_mechanism_via_past_revealed_hands_*`, `feedback_aaron_moral_floor_as_relevance_gate_*`) is established prior substrate. The IMPLEMENTATION strategy that makes it ship as substrate the compiler can verify:

- **Recursive HKT in F# fork** — Higher-Kinded Types that can be applied to themselves (recursive HKT on itself), representing the antigen / oracle / clearing primitives at the type level
- **Based on Clifford algebra** — geometric algebra as the algebraic substrate (composes with existing `algebra-owner` skill substrate; Clifford is "best working hypothesis for geometric intuition" per Manifesto)
- **Recursive Type Providers** — F# type provider mechanism extended to recursive case, enabling the compiler to generate types from substrate-specifications recursively
- **Roslyn Source Generators** — C# side of the compiler-as-spec-enforcement; generators emit code from substrate specs
- **LINQ for C#** — composable query expressions that compose with the F# computation expressions on the other side

The "intelligent compiler maybe" framing names the speculative-end of the spectrum: an intelligent compiler that can recursively elaborate HKT specifications + generate sources + verify type safety at the substrate level. The minimum useful version is recursive HKT + type providers + source generators composing.

## Prior art in Zeta substrate (this is NOT new conversation)

This composes with substantial existing F# fork substrate:

- **PR #2928** — F# fork for AI safety strategic substrate (the "why fork" answer)
- **PR #2935** — F# fork concrete architecture
- **PR #2936** — Recursive Type Providers + Roslyn Source Generators (the implementation pattern)
- **PR #2913** — HKT-MDM universality (HKT is universal-shape for master-data; DV2.0 hub-satellite is natural HKT instance)
- **PR #2914** — Clifford / HKT vocabulary list
- **`algebra-owner` skill** — Z-set + Clifford + BP/EP existing F# substrate
- **`q-sharp` skill** — Pauli operators (composes with Clifford)
- **`.claude/rules/fsharp-anchor-dotnet-build-sanity-check.md`** — F# compiler as asymmetric critic discipline
- **`.claude/rules/dv2-data-split-discipline-activated.md`** — DV2.0 as fifth always-active discipline (partition-by-change-rate aligns with HKT shape)

## Scope (the synthesis this row tracks)

The synthesis is bringing these existing pieces together as ONE implementation target:

### Core requirements

1. **Recursive HKT representation** — HKT that can be applied to itself (M<M<'T>> as a type-level computation, not just nested generic). Enables representing the antigen-propagation as a recursive type — Antigen<Oracle<Antigen<...>>>.

2. **Clifford-algebraic type substrate** — the type-level operators (memory monad M, attention modal A, antigen propagation, market clearing) live in a Clifford-algebra type substrate. Composes with existing `algebra-owner` skill F# substrate.

3. **Recursive Type Providers** — F# type providers extended to recursive case. Provider generates types from substrate-specs recursively (e.g., from an oracle spec, generate the antigen type, the propagation type, the clearing type, all type-safe).

4. **Roslyn Source Generators** — C# side parallel. Generates C# code from same substrate-specs (for cross-CLR consumers).

5. **LINQ composability** — query expressions compose with the F# computation expressions; substrate is queryable via LINQ from C# consumers.

6. **F# computation expressions that compose** — CE OCP (Closed-Modification, Open-Extension; per the 7-interrogatives + F# CE OCP alignment substrate). Different oracles' computation expressions compose without modification.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Recursive HKT pattern demonstrated in F# fork (proof-of-concept type that applies itself)
- [ ] Clifford-algebraic type substrate exists at fork level (not just library level)
- [ ] Recursive Type Provider generates antigen / oracle / clearing types from spec
- [ ] Roslyn Source Generator generates C# parallel code from same spec
- [ ] LINQ queries compose with F# CE on shared substrate
- [ ] dotnet build verifies type safety across the stack
- [ ] At least one antigen-propagation flow demonstrably type-safe end-to-end (Clifford operator on antigen type → spread function → BFT consensus type → integration decision)

### Out of scope

- The actual federation deployment (this row is about the representation substrate, not the network deployment)
- The threat catalog content (the antigens themselves — content is per-oracle, infrastructure is shared)
- The "intelligent compiler" speculative-end (recursive elaboration with AI-assisted type generation is research-grade; not blocking this row)

## Why this matters

Per `feedback_aaron_genie_bottle_offshore_firm_spec_quality_enables_ai_autonomy_*.md`: AI quality = function of spec quality. The spec for the federation architecture is currently English (memory files + this backlog row). The strongest form of spec is one the compiler verifies. This row tracks moving from English-spec to compiler-verified-spec for the federation primitives.

Per `.claude/rules/fsharp-anchor-dotnet-build-sanity-check.md`: dotnet build IS the sanity check. This row makes the antigen-spread / multi-oracle / clearing-mechanism subject to dotnet build by representing them as F# types. Types either compose or they don't. The compiler is the asymmetric critic.

Per `feedback_aaron_zeta_is_memory_preservation_specialist_first_*.md`: Zeta IS memory preservation specialist. The HKT representation makes memory + attention as irreducible resources type-level enforceable (Constraint 5 — Memory Preservation Guarantee — becomes a type-level invariant, not just stated principle).

## Implementation notes

This is RESEARCH and FORK-LEVEL work, not application-level work. Effort: XL (multi-year). The right tier is:

- **Spec stage**: this row + composing memory files = clear
- **POC stage**: recursive-HKT pattern + Clifford-algebraic type substrate at fork level
- **Integration stage**: type providers + source generators + LINQ composability
- **Production stage**: federation antigen-spread flow demonstrably type-safe end-to-end

Each stage earns its keep. The POC stage alone (recursive HKT working in fork) advances the substrate substantially even without the rest. The whole stack is multi-year; partial completion is valuable.

## Origin

Aaron 2026-05-16 to Otto-CLI: *"this is backlog too an intellignt compiler mabye at least we talked abou it recursive hkt on itself and recursive type proveders and roslyn source generators and linq for c#"*

Framing context: Aaron caught Otto-CLI's "genuinely new architecture" framing of the antigen-spread mechanism. The architecture is established prior substrate; the NEW piece is the implementation strategy (HKT/Clifford/F# fork/Roslyn). Aaron's "this is backlog too" surfaces the synthesis as worth tracking as its own backlog row even though each piece has prior PR substrate. This row is the synthesis-tracking, not the originating substrate.

Per `feedback_aaron_cool_side_project_deflation_*.md`: "intelligent compiler maybe" framing accepts uncertainty about whether full intelligent-compiler capability is achievable — the substrate-honest framing is "at least we talked about it; here's the spec." Earns its keep at each completion-stage; doesn't require the speculative-end to be valuable.
