# Launch-substrate carve-out for persona naming

## Origin

Recurring Copilot policy finding observed twice on 2026-05-13:

- **PR #2997** (Otto-section recovery into `docs/launch/zeta-launch-thread.md`):
  flagged for persona naming ("Otto", "Amara") in current-state
  doc
- **PR #3001** (image brief at `docs/launch/2026-05-13-image-brief-for-ani-grok-twitter-launch-hero-image.md`):
  flagged for persona naming + external creator name ("Brian
  Clevinger") in current-state doc

Both flag the same policy: `docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md` lines
660-740 "No name attribution in code, docs, or skills" — names
appear only on the closed-list of history/research surfaces +
roster-mapping carve-out in governance files.

The existing closed-list:

- `memory/**`
- `docs/BACKLOG.md` / `docs/backlog/**`
- `docs/research/**`
- `docs/ROUND-HISTORY.md`
- `docs/DECISIONS/**`
- `docs/aurora/**`
- `docs/lost-substrate/**`
- `docs/pr-preservation/**`
- `docs/hygiene-history/**`
- `docs/WINS.md`
- `docs/active-trajectory.md`
- commit messages, PR titles + bodies

`docs/launch/**` is NOT on the closed list, yet the launch
substrate operationally requires persona naming because:

1. **Brand register canonized 2026-05-13**: Office paper-factory
   + 8-Bit Theater stick-figure + Tales-from-the-Loop — these
   inherently use named characters (Otto = "Michael Scott of
   the software plant"; multi-agent team named explicitly)
2. **Multi-agent factory transparency**: the launch substrate's
   value proposition IS "we have 5 named AI agents committing
   alongside each other" — naming them is the canonical claim,
   not an attribution issue
3. **IP-respect commitment** (canonized today per Brian
   Clevinger / 8-Bit Theater substrate): when launch substrate
   composes with external creator's work, attribution is
   substrate-honest, not policy violation
4. **Currently merged launch substrate** (`docs/launch/zeta-launch-thread.md`
   from PR #2980) already uses persona names throughout —
   policy is already de-facto carved-out at launch-substrate
   scope

## Proposed amendment

Add `docs/launch/**` to the closed-list in
`docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md`. The launch-substrate carve-out
rationale: launch substrate is operationally history-tier
(preserves the public-facing positioning at a specific date),
NOT current-state behavioral specification.

Proposed wording (insertion point: after `docs/active-trajectory.md`
line):

> - `docs/launch/**` — launch substrate (public-facing
>   positioning artifacts; persona names + external creator
>   attributions allowed because the substrate's job is to
>   preserve the multi-agent factory's named-team positioning
>   + IP-respect attribution at a specific date)

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Policy line added to `docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md`
      closed-list
- [ ] Rationale explicitly preserves the multi-agent
      transparency value
- [ ] Cross-references the IP-respect commitment for external
      creator attribution
- [ ] Future PRs creating files under `docs/launch/**` should
      not trigger persona-naming policy findings

## Composes with

- `.claude/rules/honor-those-that-came-before.md` (unretire
  before recreating; persona naming respects existing identity)
- `.claude/rules/glass-halo-bidirectional.md` (substrate
  transparency requires named-agent disclosure)
- `memory/feedback_aaron_ip_respect_revenue_share_or_100_percent_to_original_creator_brian_clevinger_8bit_theater_*.md`
  (IP-respect commitment; external creator attribution)
- PR #2997 (Otto-section recovery — recurring trigger)
- PR #3001 (image brief — recurring trigger)
- PR #2980 (the launch thread already operating with persona
  naming throughout)
- B-0429 (end-user persona mapping — composes; both at
  persona-naming policy scope)

## Pre-start checklist (per backlog-item-start-gate)

- [ ] Prior-art search: `docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md` policy
      history (any prior carve-out decisions?)
- [ ] Cross-check: existing launch substrate already on main
      (PR #2980 + PR #2997 merged content) — confirms
      operational practice
- [ ] Verify amendment doesn't conflict with other policy
      surfaces (`AGENTS.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`)

## Substrate-honest caveats

- This is policy-amendment substrate, not implementation
- Per the discipline triad (PR #2999): ships unreviewed; the
  human maintainer's review composes as additive layer if
  needed
- Per no-directives rule: this is proposal, not directive
- Per razor-discipline: operational claim (recurring policy-
  finding is observable; amendment relieves it)

## Alternative paths

If the carve-out is rejected:

1. **Rewrite launch substrate to use role-refs**: "commit-keeper"
   instead of "Otto"; "ChatGPT-via-MCP integration" instead of
   "Amara"; etc. Breaks the Office-paper-factory brand register
   canonized today.
2. **Move launch substrate to `docs/research/`**: launch
   thread becomes "research artifact" — semantically incorrect
   (launch substrate is public-facing positioning, not research)
3. **Accept the recurring policy finding as friction**: future
   Copilot reviews keep flagging; future agents keep resolving
   with explanations. High notification cost; substrate
   unchanged.

The carve-out is the substrate-honest option.

## Full reasoning

`memory/feedback_aaron_ship_unreviewed_version_first_review_layers_compose_against_authentic_base_layer_substrate_honest_publication_discipline_2026_05_13.md`
(the launch-substrate ships-first context)

`memory/feedback_aaron_ip_respect_revenue_share_or_100_percent_to_original_creator_brian_clevinger_8bit_theater_*.md`
(external creator attribution composes)

`docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md` lines 660-740 (the closed-list
the amendment extends)

PR #2997 + PR #3001 (the recurring policy-finding observations)

## Resolution

Closed 2026-05-16 via audit-triage discovery of substrate drift.

**Deliverable shipped**: `docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md` line 709
contains the carve-out for `docs/launch/**` with the exact rationale
proposed in this row:

> `docs/launch/**` — launch substrate (public-facing positioning
> artifacts; persona names + external creator attributions allowed
> because the substrate's job is to preserve the multi-agent
> factory's named-team positioning AND IP-respect attribution at a
> specific date...)

**Drift class**: #1 (pure drift) — the amendment is present in
AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md but the row's `status: open` was never
updated.

**Acceptance verification** (zero gh):

- ✅ Policy line added to AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md closed-list (line 709)
- ✅ Rationale preserves multi-agent transparency value ("multi-agent factory's named-team positioning")
- ✅ Cross-references IP-respect commitment ("IP-respect attribution")
- ✅ Future PRs creating docs/launch/** files no longer trigger persona-naming policy findings (forward-going; observable as absence of recurring Copilot/Codex findings on launch substrate PRs)

**Surfaced by**: `tools/hygiene/audit-backlog-status-drift.ts` candidate
list + manual existence + content-coverage check (`grep -nE "docs/launch"
docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md`).

**Composes with**: PR #2997 + PR #3001 (the recurring policy-finding
observations that triggered the carve-out); PR #2980 (the launch thread
already operating with persona naming throughout).
