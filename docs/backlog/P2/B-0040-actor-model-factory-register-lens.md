# B-0040 — Actor model as factory-register lens

## Origin

AceHack commit `8e66e44` (2026-04-21). Filed alongside the superfluid + persistable* + shape-shifter substrate-property cluster as the next-layer-up question: does actor-model vocabulary apply to factory coordination?

## Scope

(a) **Hewitt's original 1973 formulation** + Inconsistency Robustness extension.

(b) **Erik Meijer's actor-model Channel 9 interviews** for F3 operational-resonance framing.

(c) **Akka's actor-supervision hierarchy** as possible register for persona-supervision.

(d) **Orleans virtual-actor framework** (silos + grains) as register for persona-dispatch.

(e) **Service Fabric** for durable-actor persistence analogy with persistable\*.

(f) **Explicit non-commitment** — factory does NOT adopt any specific actor framework, only the vocabulary-as-lens.

## Output

Research doc under `docs/research/actor-model-register-lens-YYYY-MM-DD.md` with applicability assessment + recommended vocab crossings + explicit rejections.

## Source motivation

The fully-async-agentic-AI factory positioning + no-bottlenecks performance frame are structurally close to actor-model's async-message-passing + supervision-tree patterns. Worth a calibration pass to see which vocabulary moves the factory cleanly and which would over-claim implementation infrastructure that doesn't exist.

## Publication-venue candidate

Workshop paper on agent-orchestration-patterns-borrowing-from-actor-model.

## Owner / review

- **Owner:** Architect
- **Co-reviewer:** Rodney (complexity-reduction on the lens-vs-framework boundary)
- **Gate:** Aaron sign-off for external publication per money-framing memory commercial-surface gate

## Pre-start checklist (2026-05-10)

**Prior-art-search:**

- `docs/research/actor-model-hewitt-meijer-akka-orleans-service-fabric-2026-04-21.md` —
  comprehensive prior-art catalog covering scope items (a)–(f); already exists.
- Related backlog: B-0038 (superfluid/persistable* cluster), B-0251 (durable-computation-
  stack incl. Orleans), B-0253 (realtime-interloop-messaging via Orleans grains), B-0254
  (infernet probabilistic triangulation).
- No existing skill or memory covers the applicability-assessment + vocab-crossing +
  explicit-rejection synthesis layer that B-0040 outputs.

**Dependency-restructure:**

- `depends_on: []` — no blocking dependencies; confirmed clean.
- Composition with B-0251 added (durable-computation-stack uses Orleans/Akka vocabulary;
  the register-lens synthesis must not conflict with that framing).

**Gap:** Prior-art catalog exists. Output synthesis doc
(`actor-model-register-lens-YYYY-MM-DD.md`) does not. That is what this item produces.

**Smallest safe slice (feat/B-0040-actor-model-register-lens, 2026-05-10):**
`docs/research/actor-model-register-lens-2026-05-10.md` — applicability assessment +
recommended vocab crossings + explicit rejections, referencing the prior-art catalog.

## Decomposition 2026-05-09 — Riven background worker smallest safe slice

B-0040 is broad (5 distinct sources + non-commitment + research doc output). Per "always re-decompose, assume mistakes" and "if too broad, decompose before implementation":

- Status remains open; children will be the implementation slices.
- Each child bounded to: (1) source survey, (2) factory-vocab mapping, (3) explicit rejection criteria (no infra adoption).
- TS/F# preference noted: future children may produce small lens-validation harnesses instead of pure docs.

Children (dependency-ordered, one per source):

1. B-0040.1 Hewitt 1973 formulation + Inconsistency Robustness (foundational actor semantics)
2. B-0040.2 Meijer actor-model interviews (F# operational resonance)
3. B-0040.3 Akka supervision hierarchy (persona-supervision register)
4. B-0040.4 Orleans virtual actors / grains (persona-dispatch lens)
5. B-0040.5 Service Fabric durable actors (persistable\* analogy)

This is exactly one bounded step: the re-decomposition. No code/docs beyond this parent update; no root checkout touched; worktree-isolated.

Next slice (B-0040.1) would implement the first child.
