# B-0283 — Interloop messaging protocol

Design the message protocol for agent-to-agent communication
replacing the broadcast file bus. Define message types (ask,
offer, receipt, blocker), delivery guarantees, and format.

## Acceptance criteria

- Research doc with protocol spec
- Message type definitions (can be F# or TS)
- Comparison: file bus vs GitHub PR comments vs dedicated channel
