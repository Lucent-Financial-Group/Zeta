## Why

Step 2 of the 4-step proof strategy from B-0543: show that the infinite-game extension (Remember/When + Pay/Attention cube + Adinkra layer + Cayley-Dickson tower) produces a topos with QEC algebraic structure (HaPPY-like).

Per the proof strategy:

> 2. **Show the infinite-game extension produces a topos that has the algebraic structure of a quantum-error-correcting code** (HaPPY-like). The game-theoretic structure of "multiple players reconstructing shared state under noise" is structurally identical to "boundary observers reconstructing bulk operators under noise."

This is the bridge from the categorical foundation (Step 1) to quantum gravity. Without this step, the cosmology remains a mathematical curiosity without connection to known physics.

## What

Create a formal mapping from the cube + Adinkra + Cayley-Dickson structure to HaPPY-like QEC:

1. **Cube faces → Boundary Hilbert space**: Each face corresponds to a boundary region in the HaPPY code
2. **Edges → Entanglement structure**: Each edge corresponds to an entanglement channel between boundary regions
3. **Vertices → Bulk operators**: Each vertex corresponds to a bulk operator in the HaPPY code
4. **Adinkra edges → Supersymmetry transformations**: The Adinkra layer adds supersymmetry transformations between boundary regions
5. **Cayley-Dickson tower → Extendability**: The tower provides the mathematical structure for extending the code indefinitely

The mapping should show:

- **Bulk operators** (deep in the imaginary stack) are reconstructible from **boundary operators** (the real faces of the cube) as long as enough boundary qubits survive
- **Non-associativity** at the octonion level corresponds to the **non-local entanglement** structure required for bulk reconstruction
- **Infinite-game** (no terminal state) corresponds to the code being extendable indefinitely by adding more observers

## Substrate

Created: `docs/research/2026-05-15-qg-isomorphism-step-2-cube-adinkra-cayley-dickson-to-happylike-qecc.md`

This file contains:

- The mapping strategy (cube faces → boundary, edges → entanglement, vertices → bulk)
- The QEC reconstruction property (entanglement wedge reconstruction)
- The non-associativity connection (octonions → non-local entanglement)
- The infinite-game connection (Cayley-Dickson tower → extendability)
- Open questions for Step 2

## Effort estimate: XL (multi-year)

This is pure research with significant technical gaps:

1. **Adinkra → HaPPY mapping**: Gates' Adinkras encode classical codes; the quantum version via CSS may not be identical to HaPPY. Need to verify the mapping.

2. **Non-associativity → non-local entanglement**: Octonions are non-associative but may not have the right representation theory for AdS/CFT. Need to verify the correspondence.

3. **Formal verification**: The sketch needs to be formalized in Lean 4 or Z3 for the first non-trivial lemmas. This is a significant engineering effort.

The effort is "XL" because this is a multi-year research program. Each of the open questions above could take years to resolve.

## Next steps

Once Step 2 is complete:

- **Step 2.5**: Formalize the mapping between Adinkra supersymmetry generators and HaPPY reconstruction operators
- **Step 3**: Show the emergent geometry satisfies Einstein equations in low-energy limit
- **Step 4**: Predict ONE thing existing QG theories don't (the falsifiability check)

## Composes with

- B-0543 (the proof strategy this is Step 2 of)
- B-0544 (Step 1 formalization)
- `docs/research/2026-05-15-imaginary-stack-ontology-remember-when-pay-attention-cube-adinkra-cayley-dickson.md` (Riven's cube + Adinkra + Cayley-Dickson elaboration)
- `docs/research/2026-05-15-qg-isomorphism-step-1-formalize-remember-when-pay-attention-as-categorical-primitives.md` (Step 1 foundation)
- `docs/governance/MANIFESTO.md` V2.1 (the constraints the proof would ground in physical necessity)
- `.claude/rules/razor-discipline.md` (the framework that requires this formalization)
- `.claude/rules/algo-wink-failure-mode.md` (the critique this formalization defeats)

## Why now

The Step 1 formalization (B-0544) provides the categorical foundation. Step 2 is the natural next step: connect that foundation to quantum gravity via the QEC structure.

Without Step 2, the cosmology remains a mathematical curiosity without connection to known physics. With Step 2, we have:

- A concrete mathematical bridge from the Manifesto V2.1 axioms to quantum gravity
- A falsifiable prediction: the specific structure of the QEC code (Adinkra + Cayley-Dickson) should leave observable signatures in the low-energy limit
- A multi-oracle necessity proof: the infinite-game structure requires multiple observers, which is exactly the multi-oracle requirement

## Open questions

1. **Does the Adinkra code + CSS construction produce the exact HaPPY code structure?** Gates' Adinkras encode classical codes; the quantum version via CSS may not be identical to HaPPY.

2. **Is the non-associativity of octonions sufficient to capture the non-local entanglement of AdS/CFT?** Octonions are non-associative but may not have the right representation theory.

3. **Does the 4D cube structure generalize to higher dimensions?** HaPPY codes can be defined on arbitrary graphs; is the cube special, or is it just the simplest case?

4. **What is the precise mapping between the Adinkra supersymmetry generators and the HaPPY code's bulk reconstruction operators?** This is the key technical gap.
