Per first-merged-wins + external-references rules, the P1 set keeps B-0370-0373; this P2 contributor-compliance set renumbered to next-free B-0452-0455 as a unit (preserves the internal depends_on chain). Substrate-cleanup tracked in B-0451."

# B-0452 — Core CONTRIBUTOR-COMPLIANCE.md authoring (renumbered from B-0370)

## Scope (atomic slice)

- Create `docs/CONTRIBUTOR-COMPLIANCE.md` with:
  - Plain-language MNPI rule for public-company contributors.
  - Industry-general vs company-specific framing examples.
  - Public-source citation requirement.
  - Otto enforcement + contributor responsibilities.
  - External lineage (SEC Rule 10b-5, Reg FD, Sarbanes-Oxley).
- Cite the ServiceTitan origin memory file.
- No cross-refs or trajectories yet (those are sibling rows).

## Acceptance

- [ ] File exists at canonical path with all 5 content bullets from B-0092 §1.
- [ ] Worked example cited.
- [ ] No legal-advice disclaimer missing.

## Why S-effort atomic

Single deliverable doc; no integration or cadence work. TS/audit later if needed.

## Pre-check

Build gate passed (0w 0e) in claim worktree. Refresh + prior-art confirmed no collision.
