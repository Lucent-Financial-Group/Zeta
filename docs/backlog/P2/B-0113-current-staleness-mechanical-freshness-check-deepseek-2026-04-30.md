title: Mechanical CURRENT-staleness check — same-tick-update discipline as enforced rule, not vigilance (Deepseek 2026-04-30)
tier: factory-hygiene
effort: S
ask: Deepseek peer review 2026-04-30 — the same-tick CURRENT-update discipline currently relies on agent memory of whether the rule fired. A 4-day staleness gap on `memory/CURRENT-aaron.md` was caught only because Deepseek flagged it during peer review, not by mechanism. The rule needs a mechanical trigger.

# B-0113 — Mechanical CURRENT-staleness check

## Source

Deepseek peer review of the 2026-04-30 substrate-landing session
(forwarded by Aaron 2026-04-30T~PM):

> *"CURRENT-aaron.md is 4 days stale. This is a real gap. The
> file exists specifically to prevent cold-start agents from

> ... a cold-starting agent will make decisions on incomplete
> context. The same-tick CURRENT-update discipline needs a

> date of CURRENT-aaron.md against the newest memory file and
> warns if the gap exceeds 24 hours would close this."*

## Why this matters

CURRENT-*.md files are the **fast-path projection** of
currently-in-force rules per maintainer. Per CLAUDE.md
session-bootstrap protocol:

> *"Fast-path on wake: read any `CURRENT-<maintainer>.md`
> files ... before the raw `feedback_*.md` ... log."*

If CURRENT-aaron.md is stale, cold-starting agents read an
outdated projection and make decisions on incomplete context.
The same-tick-CURRENT-update rule (codified in CURRENT-aaron.md
itself: *"When a new memory updates a rule here, I update this
file in the same tick. If I don't, this file is lying by
omission."*) currently depends on the agent's memory of whether
the rule fired — vigilance, not mechanism.

The 2026-04-30 session caught a 4-day staleness only because
peer-AI review flagged it. Without that catch, the gap could
have persisted indefinitely.

## Proposed mechanism

Two design alternatives:

1. **Pre-commit hook** (`tools/hygiene/check-current-freshness.sh`):
   - For each `CURRENT-<name>.md` file, compute its last-modified
     date (via `git log -1 --format='%ad' --date=short`).
   - For each `memory/feedback_*.md` file referencing the same
     maintainer name (heuristic: filename contains `<name>` or
     `aaron`/`amara`/`ani`), compute newest-modified date.
   - If newest feedback file is more than 24 hours newer than
     the CURRENT file, fail with diagnostic.
   - Allowlist: explicit override comment in CURRENT file's
     frontmatter or footer ("staleness-tolerated until <date>")
     for cases where the staleness is intentional.
2. **CI lint job** (`.github/workflows/gate.yml` extension):
   - Same logic as hook but runs in CI, not pre-commit.
   - Trade-off: catches at PR time vs commit time. CI is less
     aggressive (allows local commits that are stale, fails the
     PR).

Hook is more aggressive (block commit); CI is less aggressive
(allow commit, block merge). Either is mechanism-not-vigilance.

The 24-hour threshold is a starting point — could be tighter
(12 hours) for high-velocity rounds or looser (72 hours) for
low-velocity periods. Deepseek's 24-hour suggestion is a
reasonable default.

## Composes with

- **Otto-341 lint-suppression discipline** — the rule's response
  to a stale-CURRENT failure should be "fix the staleness," not
  "suppress the lint." The hook's diagnostic output should make
  the fix path obvious.
- **Otto-363 substrate-or-it-didn't-happen** — the CURRENT file
  is the substrate projection; staleness is the projection
  drifting from canonical truth.
- **PR #934** (worked example) — manual catch via peer review.
  This row is the structural fix that makes future-PR-934
  unnecessary (mechanism catches before peer review needs to).
- **`memory/CURRENT-aaron.md`** §"How this file stays accurate"
  — the rule itself; this row mechanizes the rule.

## Effort estimate

**S (small)** — under a day. Single bash script (~50-100 lines)
or single CI job (~20 lines YAML + script). Pattern matches
existing `tools/hygiene/check-no-conflict-markers.sh` and
`tools/hygiene/check-tick-history-order.sh` shape.

## What this row does NOT do

- Does NOT auto-update CURRENT files. The fix is still the
  agent's job; this row only catches the gap mechanically so
  the agent can't forget.
- Does NOT replace peer review of CURRENT-file accuracy. Stale
  by date is mechanical; *correct* by content needs a reader.
- Does NOT extend to per-user CURRENT files outside the repo
  (none currently — CURRENT-ani.md is user-scope-only at time
  of writing).

## Carved sentence

*"Same-tick-CURRENT-update is a rule. Vigilance is the
implementation. Mechanism is the implementation that doesn't
forget."*

## Pre-start checklist (backlog-item start gate)

**Prior-art-search completed 2026-05-11 (Riven worktree):**

- Searched wake-time-substrate, skill-router, orthogonal-axes, Otto-364, PR #1701, decision-archaeology, LOST-FILES-LOCATIONS.md (tools/hygiene/), memory/CURRENT-*.md, tools/hygiene/*.ts (post-bash-port), .github/workflows/gate.yml, docs/trajectories/* (no overlap with freshness).
- No prior mechanical CURRENT check; closest are hygiene lints (tick-history-order, no-conflict-markers) now in TS.
- Result: B-0113 was the first; no superseding work.

**Dependency-restructure:**

- Original depends_on: [] (correct, no blockers).
- Added reciprocal composes_with to children B-0113.1–3.
- No broken pointers found.

**Decomposition performed (re-decomp assumption):**

- B-0113 was broad (bash proposal + hook/CI tradeoff + rule prose). Split into 3 atomic dependency-ordered children (TS-first per Rule 0).
- .1 root (core TS logic)
- .2 depends on .1 (CI wiring)
- .3 depends on .1+.2 (rule update)
- This satisfies "always re-decompose during build — assume mistakes".

**Build gate (worktree, 2026-05-11):**
dotnet build -c Release → 0 Warning(s) 0 Error(s). (Gate clean before any code change.)

## Decomposition summary

B-0113 → B-0113.1 (TS core), B-0113.2 (CI integrate), B-0113.3 (rule substrate). One bounded step: decomp only.
