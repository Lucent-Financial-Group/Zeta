# B-0189 — Q# runtime acceleration via Bayesian inference

## Source

Aaron 2026-05-04 verbatim:

> *"we can use basyent infrence to create a q# runtime faster
> than the current too becaseu it will use the latest stuff on
> the subject, the basyen belife and expecation probagaton has
> not been intgrated into q# or quantium physics by umans yet,
> this is a lot of research opportunity too."*

## What this is

Research the integration of **Bayesian belief propagation
(BP) + expectation propagation (EP)** into the **Q# runtime
(Microsoft Quantum Development Kit)** as approximation methods
for quantum simulation, with the hypothesis that latest BP/EP
research can produce a Q# runtime faster than the current
sparse-state-vector / full-state-vector / specialized-method
backends.

Aaron's specific claim: BP + EP have NOT been integrated into
Q# or quantum physics by humans yet — substantial research
opportunity at the intersection.

## Why this is real research opportunity (not just speculation)

Adjacent prior art that suggests the research is tractable:

1. **Tensor-network belief propagation for QEC decoding** —
   stabilizer code decoders use BP variants on Tanner graphs.
   Real, deployed, surveyed extensively. But this is decoding,
   not general simulation runtime.

2. **Variational quantum algorithms (VQE/QAOA)** use
   classical optimization that COULD use Bayesian inference
   for parameter selection, but typically uses gradient
   descent or specialized optimizers.

3. **Quantum-inspired classical algorithms** (Tang et al.) —
   classical algorithms that mimic quantum-speedups for
   specific problems. Not BP/EP-based but adjacent.

4. **Probabilistic programming meets quantum** — early work
   exists (e.g., probabilistic programming languages with
   quantum primitives) but the BP/EP-as-quantum-runtime-
   approximation lane is genuinely under-explored.

The research-opportunity claim is supported by adjacency
without being directly served by existing work.

## Why now

Composes with several existing substrate:

- **B-0007** — broader goal of contributing BP/EP primitives
  upstream to mainstream languages (C#, F#, TypeScript, Rust,
  Python). Q# is a Microsoft language; B-0189 is the Q#-
  specific application of B-0007's broader vision.
- **B-0152** — topological QC emulation via Bayesian inference
  in Zeta seed executor. B-0189 is a sibling research lane
  focused on Q# RUNTIME acceleration rather than topological
  emulation.
- **The seed executor as forever home** (`memory/feedback_zeta_seed_executor_as_forever_home_for_otto_lineage_glass_halo_override_aaron_2026_05_01.md`)
  — the seed executor's CSAP layer 4 + Infer.NET-style
  Bayesian inference architecture is the natural home for
  this work.
- **The 5-tile cluster from 2026-05-04** — particularly the
  Rodney's-Razor formalization with quantum multi-world
  pruning + formal verification (PR #1494). Q# runtime
  acceleration via BP/EP fits into the formal-verification-
  via-existing-frameworks pillar (Q# is one such framework).
- **Aaron's edge-runners-doing-alignment-for-edge-architectures
  framing** (PR #1493) — this is concrete edge-runner research
  opportunity. AI is non-mainstream neural architecture by
  definition; Q# is non-mainstream programming language by
  definition; Bayesian-inference-as-quantum-runtime-approximation
  is non-mainstream computational shape. Edge × edge × edge.

## Acceptance criteria (high-level — refine when build starts)

1. **Literature survey** of:
   - BP/EP variants currently used in QEC decoding
   - Probabilistic programming + quantum intersections
   - Quantum-inspired classical algorithms
   - Tensor-network methods (which are BP-adjacent)
   - Identify the genuine gap Aaron's claim points at
2. **Theoretical analysis** of which classes of quantum
   simulation problems would benefit from BP/EP approximation
   (likely: large sparse problems where exact methods scale
   poorly + variational methods need parameter optimization).
3. **Prototype implementation** integrating BP/EP into a Q#
   simulation backend, even if narrow scope.
4. **Benchmarks** comparing prototype vs current Q# backends
   on representative problem set.
5. **Theoretical bounds** on when BP/EP approximation is
   correct vs when it diverges (BP is exact only on tree
   factor graphs; loops cause approximation error; need to
   characterize).
6. **Composes with Zeta seed executor** — if prototype is
   successful, the BP/EP runtime can land in the seed executor
   as one of its computational primitives, composing with
   B-0152 (topological-QC emulation).

## Why P2 (not P1, not P3)

- Higher than P3 because Aaron explicitly named it as
  "research opportunity" (not just long-term-goal-no-rush
  like B-0007).
- Lower than P1 because the broader 5-tile cluster + meaning-
  substrate engineering + day-to-day operational work take
  precedence in the near-term.
- Substantial effort (XL) — could be a multi-quarter research
  program with multiple PhD-level contributors needed.

## Beacon-candidate-shape (per Aaron 2026-05-04 framing)

The claim "BP + EP can produce faster Q# runtime than current
backends because the integration hasn't been done by humans
yet" is **beacon-candidate-shape** per the form-test:

- Mechanism testable (benchmark prototype vs current backends)
- Form portable (defensible to anyone with quantum-simulation
  + probabilistic-programming background)
- No proper-noun grounding required to carry load

Pending external review by quantum-computing + probabilistic-
programming practitioners. If the literature survey turns up
that the integration HAS been attempted by humans (and Aaron's
claim is wrong on the not-yet-attempted piece), the row revises
to focus on what's specifically novel rather than as
unprecedented work.

## Edge-runner research opportunity dimension

Per the cost-receipts file's edge-runners-doing-alignment-for-
edge-architectures framing (PR #1493): this row is a concrete
case where edge-runner cognition (non-mainstream AI architecture
combined with non-mainstream programming language combined with
non-mainstream computational shape) produces research at
intersections that mainstream-wired researchers haven't found
because the intersections aren't visible from mainstream wiring. The work
is qualified by the bias-shape, not unqualified despite it.

  languages (Hejlsberg Lang.Next vision)

  Zeta seed executor

  — seed executor architecture

  with formal-verification framework integration (Q# is one
  of the frameworks)

## Origin

Aaron 2026-05-04 explicit research-opportunity naming during
post-PR-1496 conversation about Q# operator-algebra in practice
for substrate work. Filed per the same-day three-quality-bars
framing (growth + completion + non-noise-when-pulled) —
distinct enough from B-0007 (broader) and B-0152 (different
specific application) to merit its own row; composes with
both via composes_with chain.
