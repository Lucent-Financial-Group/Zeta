# Example row — self-reference demonstrating the per-row-file schema

This is a placeholder row that exists to:

1. Exercise the `tools/backlog/generate-index.sh` generator
   against a non-empty `docs/backlog/` tree, so drift-CI and
   manual `--check` runs have something to validate.
2. Show contributors what the file shape looks like end-to-
   end — frontmatter + body.
3. Serve as the first B-NNNN so Phase-2 content migration
   starts numbering from B-0002.

## What this row claims

Nothing substantive. It's self-referential: it exists
because the generator needs at least one row file to
demonstrate the sort + index emission, and a zero-row
directory would make the new infrastructure harder to
verify.

When Phase 2 migrates the real `docs/BACKLOG.md` content
into per-row files, this example either stays as the
schema-documentation-example or gets retired (and
recovered via `git log --diff-filter=D` if needed).

## Future path

- Phase 1b: when `backlog-index-integrity.yml` workflow
  lands, this row confirms the CI drift-check passes on
  a non-trivial input.
- Phase 2: migrate existing BACKLOG.md rows starting at
  B-0002.
- Phase 3: remove this example when the schema-demo role
  is filled by real content, per CLAUDE.md "retire by
  deletion" discipline.
