# Immune system upgrades — research absorb

Aaron sent input on 2026-04-30 via the autonomous-loop maintainer
channel asking the factory to backlog "immune system upgrades" with
5 supporting source links (1 Wikipedia article + 4 distinct YouTube
videos). The framing composes directly with the Aurora-immune-
governance bridge work
([docs/research/aurora-immune-governance-bridge-minimal-2026-04-28.md](../../research/aurora-immune-governance-bridge-minimal-2026-04-28.md),
landed via PR #707) and with the broader Glass Halo /
superorganism factory framing.

This is a research-absorb row, not an immediate implementation
task. The substantive work is:

1. Watch + read the source material (one pass, then a careful
   pass for note-taking).
2. Cross-reference each immune-system concept against the existing
   Aurora-immune translations already on main and against the
   superorganism framing in the multi-AI-factory substrate.
3. Identify one or more concrete factory-immune upgrades — e.g.,
   antigen-recognition for prompt-injection patterns, granuloma-
   shape isolation for compromised actors, complement-cascade
   shape for chained defense rules, hive-immune coordination for
   multi-AI review patterns.
4. File one or more follow-up rows for any concrete upgrade that
   passes the "load-bearing + falsifiable + composes with existing
   substrate" three-test (per Aurora's bridge-note discipline).

## Aaron's verbatim input (channel preservation per Otto-363)

The first YouTube URL repeats; the deduplicated set is 4 YouTube
videos plus the Superorganism Wikipedia article. The repeat is
preserved verbatim in case the duplication itself is signal (e.g.
Aaron emphasising that source twice).

## Why this matters

- The Aurora-immune-governance bridge note (PR #707) already
  established that immune-system metaphors map cleanly to
  governance / substrate-protection patterns in the factory. The
  bridge note enumerated 3 immune translations + a falsifier +
  prototype + boundaries, but explicitly framed itself as
  "minimal" — it did not claim to enumerate every translation.
- New material from Aaron's channel suggests further translations
  worth investigating, especially the **superorganism** layer
  (multi-AI / multi-actor coordination as a single organism rather
  than a federation of agents — composes with the agent-orchestra
  v3/v4 framing in
  `memory/feedback_zeta_agent_orchestra_capability_role_claim_isolation_aaron_amara_2026_04_29.md`).
- Soak-period work (post-Bucket-B-closure) is itself an immune
  response — production runs validate ports, infections (real
  bugs) surface or don't. Soak + bash-retirement is a pattern
  that already has an immune-system vocabulary; explicit research
  may sharpen the terms.

## Scope (research-absorb shape)

This row produces:

- A `docs/research/2026-04-XX-immune-system-upgrades-absorb.md`
  research note (per Otto-363 substrate-or-it-didn't-happen +
  the channel-verbatim-preservation discipline).
- Notes covering each source: claim, frame, candidate Zeta
  translation, falsifier, status (candidate / promoted / dismissed).
- A list of follow-up rows for any candidates that promote to
  load-bearing factory rules.

Out of scope for this row:

- Implementing the immune upgrades. (Implementation rows are the
  follow-ups, not this one.)
- Promoting any of the candidate translations to canonical
  doctrine without the normal Architect / multi-AI review path.
- Re-doing the work the bridge note (PR #707) already did. Cite
  the bridge note where its translations cover the same ground.

## When this is "done"

Done = research note lands on main + all viable candidates have
either filed follow-up rows OR been explicitly dismissed in the
note (with a one-line reason). Rejected candidates stay in the
note as substrate (negative-result lineage).

## Composes with

- `docs/research/aurora-immune-governance-bridge-minimal-2026-04-28.md`
  (PR #707) — existing immune translations to extend.
- `memory/feedback_zeta_agent_orchestra_capability_role_claim_isolation_aaron_amara_2026_04_29.md`
  — superorganism / multi-AI coordination layer to
  cross-reference.
- B-0086 (TS+Bun migration) — soak-period work surfaces the
  "production-as-immune-test" frame already.
- Glass Halo origin substrate — the superorganism framing extends
  the canary-phrase + collective-coherence lineage.

## Pre-start checklist (backlog-item start gate)

**Prior-art search (2026-05-11):**

- Refreshed worldview via `bun tools/github/refresh-worldview.ts` (no open duplicate claims for B-0108; 68 live claims surveyed, none overlap immune/aurora/superorganism absorb).
- Grep for "immune" / "superorganism" / "aurora-immune" across docs/backlog/ and docs/research/ (only the existing aurora bridge note + this row; no prior absorb implementation).
- Dependency check: `depends_on: []` clean; `composes_with: [B-0086]` verified (TS soak frame still relevant).
- No conflicting worktree or origin/claim/* for this row.

**Dependency-restructure:** No `depends_on` chain to walk (empty); reciprocal `composes_with` already present on B-0086 side per index hygiene. No broken pointers. Supersession history n/a (fresh research-absorb).

This gate passed before any child-row creation or index regen.

## Decomposition (re-decomp, one bounded step, 2026-05-11)

B-0108 decomposed into 3 smallest atomic dependency-ordered child rows (research-absorb slices, TS-preferring per Rule 0).

**Buildable now (no deps):**

- B-0406 — Immune source material survey + note capture (atomic research pass)
- B-0407 — Cross-reference + candidate translation identification (atomic)

**Blocked on B-0406 + B-0407:**

- B-0408 — Promoted-candidate follow-up row filing + absorb closure (atomic)

Umbrella B-0108 now depends on the children for selection discipline; research note and candidate list live in the children. One bounded step: this PR only. Re-decomp assumed possible on review.

**Children:**

- B-0406
- B-0407
- B-0408
