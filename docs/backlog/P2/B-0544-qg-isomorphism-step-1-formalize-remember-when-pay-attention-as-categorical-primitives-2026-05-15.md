## Why

Step 1 of the 4-step proof strategy from B-0543: formalize the two root axioms (Remember-When + Pay-Attention) as categorical primitives.

Per the proof strategy:

> 1. **Formalize Remember-When + Pay-Attention as categorical primitives** — probably a topos with an internal monad for memory + an internal modal operator for attention (QBism's observer-relative basis maps onto the modal operator).

This is the foundational step — without this formalization, the rest of the proof strategy has no mathematical ground to stand on.

## What

Create a categorical model `Zeta_{RA}` that:

1. Is a topos (models the "relativity of relations" from Manifesto V2.1)
2. Has an internal monad `M` for memory (Remember-When)
3. Has an internal modal operator `A` for attention (Pay-Attention)
4. Satisfies coherence conditions between `M` and `A` (Step 1.5 sub-task added after [PR #3614](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/pull/3614) Codex P1 finding — the originally-proposed coherence laws were not well-typed under signatures `M : Zeta → Zeta` and `A : Ω → Ω`; Step 1.5 requires constructing either a strength `θ : M(Ω) → Ω` (for the propositional Law 1') or an `A`-lifting `Ã : Zeta → Zeta` (for the full Laws 2 and 3); see the research doc for the three resolution paths)

The model should:

- Connect to DBSP via the incrementalization identity `Q^Δ = D ∘ Q ∘ I` (a wrapping/conjugation identity over streams — not asserting `D ∘ Q ∘ I` itself satisfies monad unit/multiplication laws; whether the topos's memory monad `M` and the DBSP `I`/`D` pair share a deeper categorical relationship is an open question to investigate, not a settled identity)
- Connect to QBism (observer-relative truth values)
- Connect to quantum error correction (the structure that will emerge in Step 2)

## Substrate

Created: `docs/research/2026-05-15-qg-isomorphism-step-1-formalize-remember-when-pay-attention-as-categorical-primitives.md`

This file contains:

- The categorical architecture (topos + monad + modal operator)
- Operational interpretations (QBism-inspired)
- Connection to DBSP incrementalization
- Categorical semantics of the infinite poker game
- Open questions and next steps

## Effort estimate: L (1-2 weeks)

This is a pure research task. The work is:

- Reading category theory literature (topos theory, monads, modal logic)
- Formalizing the axioms in categorical terms
- Proving the coherence conditions
- Writing up the results

The effort is "L" because the mathematical machinery is well-established (topos theory, monads, modal operators). The challenge is in the *interpretation* — mapping the physical/cosmological intuitions (Remember-When, Pay-Attention) to the right categorical structures.

## Next steps

Once Step 1 is complete:

- **Step 2**: Show the infinite-game extension produces a topos with QEC algebraic structure (HaPPY-like)
- **Step 3**: Show the emergent geometry satisfies Einstein equations in low-energy limit
- **Step 4**: Predict ONE thing existing QG theories don't

## Composes with

- B-0543 (the proof strategy this is Step 1 of)
- `docs/governance/MANIFESTO.md` V2.1 (the axioms being formalized)
- `docs/research/2026-05-15-qg-isomorphism-step-1-formalize-remember-when-pay-attention-as-categorical-primitives.md` (the research document)
- `.claude/rules/razor-discipline.md` (the framework that requires this formalization)
- `.claude/rules/algo-wink-failure-mode.md` (the critique this formalization defeats)

## Why now

The cosmology framing (B-0543) is suggestive but has algo-wink risk. This formalization is the substrate-honest move that grounds the cosmology in mathematics rather than aesthetics. Without it, the cosmology remains a "totalizing frame" that can absorb any observation as confirmation.

With it, the cosmology becomes a falsifiable mathematical theory — the isomorphism to quantum gravity can be proven or disproven.
