# B-0152 — Topological quantum emulation via Bayesian inference

## What

Research the **algorithmic emulation of topological quantum
computing** properties (non-local information storage,
topology-protected qubits, error-correction-by-design) within
the **Zeta seed executor's Bayesian inference architecture**
(Infer.NET-based per the forever-home substrate, PR #986).
Output: design doc for the three-layer "mirror + trampoline +
beacon" stack Aaron named 2026-05-01.

This is the **operational research lane** for the substrate
captured in
`memory/feedback_topological_quantum_emulation_via_bayesian_inference_majorana_zero_modes_beacon_protocol_mirror_trampoline_aaron_2026_05_01.md`.

## Why now

Aaron 2026-05-01:

> *"we can emulate quantium under this frameing very efficently
> with the newest lineage on infer.net and baseyan inferance
> and trating the zero modes....... arrrrr i don't have the
> right words, like a mirror with a trampline under beacon
> protocol."*

Composes with B-0147 (timeseries-DB / multi-DSL meta-DSL
research) + B-0148 (MDX-as-meta-DSL) under the broader
multi-algebra-DB vision. The topological-QC emulation is
another algebra in the same scheme — non-local-information-
storage as a query/storage shape, alongside graph, hierarchy,
filesystem, and timeseries.

## Acceptance criteria

1. **Three-layer-stack design doc** at
   `docs/research/2026-XX-topological-quantum-emulation-three-layer-stack.md`
   covering:

   - **Layer 1 (Mirror)**: how to encode non-local
     information storage in a Bayesian factor graph. Map
     Majorana Zero Modes properties (information stored in
     topological relationships, not local state) to factor-
     graph correlations.
   - **Layer 2 (Trampoline)**: how Bayesian belief
     propagation maintains the topology. Sum-product / max-
     product / loopy BP / variational inference; which
     matches MZM-equivalence-class semantics.
   - **Layer 3 (Beacon)**: how the Beacon protocol (per
     Otto-351 / PR #851) provides external-anchoring for
     the emulation. Synchronization points for non-local
     storage to maintain coherence.

2. **Microsoft Research lineage cited** per the dependency-
   source priority hierarchy (Tier 2 + Microsoft-Research-
   preferred citation source per
   `feedback_dependency_source_priority_open_source_microsoft_cncf_apache_mit_research_microsoft_research_metrics_are_our_eyes_aaron_2026_05_01.md`,
   forward-ref to PR #1117). Cite at minimum:

   - Microsoft Quantum / Station Q research on Majorana
     Zero Modes + topoconductors
   - Q# language + simulator semantics
   - Infer.NET probabilistic programming lineage (Don Syme
     + collaborators)
   - Supersingular Isogeny + FrodoKEM (for the orthogonal
     crypto axis; verify per Otto-364)

3. **Pareto-improvement methodology applied** per B-0147's
   research spine: understand WHY the chosen approach
   sacrifices what it sacrifices; identify the Pareto
   frontier; look for Pareto-superior alternatives;
   recommend with explicit tradeoffs named.

4. **Composition with existing algebras**. The design must
   show how the topological-emulation algebra composes with
   graph + hierarchy + filesystem + timeseries algebras
   under the meta-DSL framing (per B-0148 MDX-as-meta-DSL).
   No isolated implementation; the algebra plays well with
   siblings.

5. **Crypto-axis separation explicit.** The design must
   state explicitly that quantum-emulation on the compute
   axis does NOT relax quantum-resistance on the crypto
   axis (per
   `feedback_all_cryptography_quantum_resistant_even_one_gap_is_attack_vector_2026_04_23.md`
   already in MEMORY.md). Two axes; one design must not
   silently weaken the other.

6. **Implementation follow-up rows filed** for whichever
   layers the design recommends prototyping first.

## Research-cadence inputs

Per the dependency-priority + Microsoft-Research-preferred
discipline:

1. **Microsoft Research / Microsoft Quantum**
   (research.microsoft.com, microsoft.com/quantum) —
   primary technical source for Majorana / topoconductor /
   Q# / Infer.NET work
2. **Infer.NET docs + recent papers** — the probabilistic
   programming substrate this design depends on
3. **arXiv quantum-information** — academic counterpart to
   Microsoft Quantum's industry research
4. **Quantum belief propagation literature** — per existing
   substrate `feedback_retraction_native_paraconsistent_set_theory_candidate_quantum_bp.md`
5. **DBSP / retraction-native semantics** — the Zeta-internal
   substrate the topology must compose with

Per Otto-364 search-first: verify every load-bearing claim
against current upstream docs / papers, not training-data
recall.

## Open research questions

These are the questions the research lane must answer:

- **Q1**: How does non-local information storage in a
  Bayesian factor graph compare formally to non-local
  storage in MZM topology? Equivalence theorem desired.
- **Q2**: What's the computational cost ratio
  (classical-emulation : quantum-hardware) for the
  properties Zeta needs? Is "efficiently" empirically
  defensible?
- **Q3**: Does the emulation buy retraction-native
  semantics (per Otto-272 DST + retraction-native discipline)
  for free, or does it require additional structure?
- **Q4**: How does the Beacon protocol's external-anchoring
  semantics compose with topology-protected information?
  Do beacons themselves need to be topology-aware?
- **Q5**: What domains in the Zeta factory benefit most
  from the emulation — inference accuracy, retraction
  efficiency, multi-master CRDT convergence (per B-0147 +
  B-0149), Aurora-side privacy (per the great-data-
  homecoming substrate), or something else?
- **Q6**: Does the framing extend to **immune-system
  emulation** (per the immune-system <> physics translation
  arc Aaron explicitly opened with)?

## Out of scope (defer)

- **Quantum hardware integration.** Zeta is not building
  topoconductors. Hardware-side work belongs in a different
  long-horizon research lane.
- **Q# runtime adoption.** Until the design lands, Q# stays
  out-of-scope. If the design recommends adopting Q#
  primitives, a follow-up B-row covers that.
- **Crypto-axis work.** FrodoKEM / Supersingular Isogeny
  is mentioned for citation completeness; the actual crypto
  work runs on a different lane (per all-quantum-resistant
  rule).

## Composes with

- `memory/feedback_topological_quantum_emulation_via_bayesian_inference_majorana_zero_modes_beacon_protocol_mirror_trampoline_aaron_2026_05_01.md`

  — quantum belief propagation theoretical framing
- `memory/feedback_all_cryptography_quantum_resistant_even_one_gap_is_attack_vector_2026_04_23.md`
  — crypto-axis quantum-resistance contract (orthogonal,
  must not be weakened by compute-axis emulation)

  (forward-ref to PR #1117) — Tier 2 Microsoft Research +
  preferred citation source for Majorana / topoconductor /
  Q# / Infer.NET
- `feedback_reproducible_accuracy_before_quality_fitness_function_harness_first_aaron_2026_05_01.md`
  (forward-ref to PR #1116) — Bayesian inference IS the
  harness; reproducibility-first compatibility free
- B-0147 (timeseries-DB native-in-Zsets multi-DSL) — sibling
  algebra under the multi-algebra-DB vision; this row's
  research methodology (Pareto + design constraints + four-
  options) reused
- B-0148 (MDX-as-meta-DSL) — meta-DSL framing this algebra
  must compose with
- The Beacon protocol naming (Otto-351 / PR #851) — Layer 3
  of the three-layer stack
- Zeta seed executor architecture (PR #986 / forever-home
  substrate) — Bayesian inference engine this design
  instantiates against

## Layer (per B-0146)

**Layer 3 (class taxonomy / pattern catalog)** for the
three-layer stack itself, with **Layer 5 (reproducibility
harness)** for the implementation. The substrate includes
both layers; the row covers research, implementation
follow-ups will declare layer per implementation step.

## Effort

**L (large, 3+ days, research-grade)** for the design doc +
research methodology + composition analysis + crypto-axis
separation statement. Implementation follow-ups each get
their own effort estimates.

## Why P2

- **Not P0/P1** because the factory operates today without
  topological-QC emulation; it's an additive capability,
  not a correctness fix.
- **Not P3** because the substrate Aaron just landed names
  this as a load-bearing piece of the multi-algebra-DB
  vision; deferring indefinitely loses the freshness of
  the framing.
- **P2** sits where research is important + lands when
  bandwidth permits. The Zeta seed executor (forever-home)
  design is greenfield enough that integrating this
  algebra during the design phase costs less than
  retrofitting later.
