# Closed bidirectional causal loop — spec ↔ F# ↔ C# ↔ Rust mutual regeneration chain

## Why

Aaron + Mika LOCKED-IN at lines ~4724-4731 of [`docs/research/2026-05-18-mika-grok-bootstream-sovereignty-causal-loops.md`](../../research/2026-05-18-mika-grok-bootstream-sovereignty-causal-loops.md):

> Mika line ~4727: *"What you're describing is basically a closed causal loop between spec and implementation. The spec and the code are co-evolving and keeping each other honest. The idea that the specification and the actual running code should always be able to regenerate each other, creating a stable, self-correcting system?"*

> Mika line ~4731 (LOCK-IN): *"You're describing a chain of bidirectional causal loops — where each layer can regenerate the layer above and below it. So it would look something like: Spec ↔ F#, F# ↔ C#, C# ↔ Rust. Each pair has to be able to regenerate the other. The moment that bidirectional link breaks, you know something has gone wrong. This is actually a very strong form of system integrity. It's like having checksums at every layer, except the checksum can fully reconstruct the thing it's checking."*

This row SHARPENS [B-0632](../P3/B-0632-no-privileged-implementation-three-spec-distinction-mika-2026-05-18.md) (no-privileged-implementation; mutual regeneration) by specifying the **chain structure** of bidirectional causal loops across the language ladder.

## The locked-in chain structure

```
Spec ↔ F# ↔ C# ↔ Rust ↔ [further layers]
   ↑     ↑      ↑        ↑
   each pair must be able to regenerate the other
```

Per Mika's formulation, **each PAIR in the chain must support bidirectional regeneration**:

| Pair | Spec→F# direction | F#→Spec direction |
|---|---|---|
| **Spec ↔ F#** | Spec generates F# implementation skeleton | F# implementation can regenerate the formal spec it satisfies |
| **F# ↔ C#** | F# code can be lowered to C# (interop facade) | C# can regenerate F# semantics (round-trip) |
| **C# ↔ Rust** | C# code can be lowered to Rust (perf-critical paths) | Rust can regenerate C# semantics |
| ... | Each additional layer adds another bidirectional pair | ... |

**Integrity violation criterion**: the moment ANY pair's bidirectional link breaks (one direction fails to round-trip), the system signals a known-error: "something has gone wrong between these two layers."

## Why this is stronger than ordinary "consistency"

Ordinary consistency: spec and implementation must AGREE. Either can be the source-of-truth; the other follows.

**Bidirectional causal loop**: spec and implementation must MUTUALLY GENERATE each other. Neither is privileged; both are constrained to be reconstructable from the other. This is a **stronger** form of integrity:

| Ordinary consistency | Bidirectional causal loop |
|---|---|
| Spec authors → implementation follows | Spec ↔ implementation, mutual generation |
| Implementation drift detected by re-running spec checks | Drift detected because round-trip fails |
| Spec changes require implementation updates | Spec changes AND implementation changes both must regenerate each other |
| Source-of-truth is the spec | Source-of-truth is the BIDIRECTIONAL LOOP ITSELF |

Mika's analogy: *"like having checksums at every layer, except the checksum can fully reconstruct the thing it's checking."* The bidirectional loop is a **generative checksum** — drift detection AND drift recovery in one mechanism.

## Composition with permanent coliseum (B-0649)

[B-0649](../P3/B-0649-permanent-coliseum-language-deathmatch-retractable-substrate-mika-2026-05-18.md) (permanent coliseum / language deathmatch) establishes that languages compete on translation pressure. This row provides the **structural mechanism** for that competition:

- Each language in the coliseum participates in the bidirectional chain
- A language that can't round-trip with its neighbors fails the integrity criterion → eliminated
- Languages that round-trip cleanly survive
- The coliseum criterion = bidirectional-link-survival, not arbitrary preference

The two rows together: B-0649 establishes the competitive frame; this row specifies the integrity mechanism that determines winners.

## Composition with B-0632 (the sharpening relationship)

[B-0632](../P3/B-0632-no-privileged-implementation-three-spec-distinction-mika-2026-05-18.md) (no-privileged-implementation; mutual regeneration) is the **principle**. This row is the **mechanism**:

- B-0632: spec and implementation must continuously validate and regenerate each other
- B-0662 (this row): SPECIFICALLY, each adjacent pair in the chain (Spec↔F#, F#↔C#, C#↔Rust, ...) must support bidirectional regeneration

This row doesn't replace B-0632 — it OPERATIONALIZES B-0632 into a concrete chain-of-pairs structure that can be verified per-pair.

## Different layers can have different regeneration strengths

Per Mika line ~4731: *"Do you want every link in this chain to be equally strong (fully bidirectional regeneration), or are you okay with some layers being weaker — like maybe the Rust layer only needs to be able to regenerate upward, but not necessarily regenerate the spec perfectly?"*

This is an **open design question** for the implementation. Possibilities:

| Configuration | Trade-off |
|---|---|
| **Fully bidirectional all layers** | Maximum integrity; maximum implementation cost; strict regeneration cascade |
| **Asymmetric at bottom of chain** | Lower layers (Rust) regenerate UPWARD only (Rust → C# → F# → Spec); easier to ship; weaker bottom-up validation |
| **Spec-anchored** | Spec ↔ F# fully bidirectional; F# → C# → Rust one-way generation; spec stays the validation anchor |
| **Continuous-validation only** | Bidirectional regeneration possible but not always run; CI runs continuous-validation that triggers full regeneration on demand |

The right configuration depends on the specific properties at stake. This row's GOAL section calls out the design decision as open work.

## Composition with three-faction BFT formal proof (B-0652)

[B-0652](B-0652-three-faction-bft-mechanism-tla-z-state-layered-formal-proof-strategy-aaron-mika-2026-05-18.md) (three-faction BFT + TLA+/Z-state layered formal proof) provides the FORMAL VERIFICATION substrate. This row provides the SOURCE-LANGUAGE chain that verification operates over:

- TLA+ specs sit at the Spec layer of this chain
- F# implementation is the working substrate the specs prove correct
- C# / Rust layers extend the chain for interop + performance-critical paths
- TLA+ ↔ Spec ↔ F# pairs provide the formal-verification mutual-regeneration boundary

## Composition with persistent integrator (B-0653)

[B-0653](../P3/B-0653-persistent-bayesian-integrator-continuous-health-monitor-aaron-mika-2026-05-18.md) (persistent Bayesian integrator continuous health monitor) provides the EMPIRICAL OBSERVATION substrate. Bidirectional-link-integrity becomes one of the health metrics it monitors:

- Each pair's round-trip success rate IS a health metric
- Degradation → alert + auto-overcorrect routing (e.g., "Rust↔C# link breaking; DST this area")
- Continuous-monitoring composes with bounded-formal-verification at the chain layer

## Operational implications

1. **Build infrastructure**: CI must support round-trip tests for each pair in the chain
2. **Language selection criterion**: candidate languages for the coliseum must support bidirectional regeneration with at least one existing chain participant
3. **Refactor discipline**: changes to ANY layer require regenerating affected pairs + verifying round-trip
4. **Spec drift detection**: spec ↔ implementation drift surfaces as round-trip failure, not as separate audit
5. **Self-correcting**: when drift is detected, the failing pair indicates EXACTLY where to look for the cause (vs vague "spec and code are out of sync")

## What this is NOT

- NOT a forced "rewrite everything in every language" requirement (only the chain-pair regeneration capability is required; can be implemented at modest scope)
- NOT a replacement for ordinary testing (composes with; doesn't substitute)
- NOT a requirement that every existing repo code immediately satisfy the chain (incremental adoption; new substrate is held to the standard; existing substrate migrates as practical)
- NOT a guarantee of no bugs (the chain detects layer-mismatch; agent-error within a single layer still requires ordinary verification)

## Goal

1. Canonical governance doc: `docs/governance/BIDIRECTIONAL-CAUSAL-LOOP-CHAIN.md`
2. Specify the initial chain participants (recommended: Spec ↔ F# ↔ C# ↔ Rust; extensible)
3. Resolve the asymmetry design decision (fully-bidirectional vs anchored vs asymmetric-bottom)
4. CI infrastructure for round-trip verification per pair
5. Composition with B-0632 (sharpening) + B-0649 (coliseum) + B-0652 (formal proof) + B-0653 (continuous monitoring)
6. Worked example: a small spec ↔ F# ↔ C# round-trip with each direction verified
7. Knights Guild ratification per [B-0628](../P3/B-0628-knights-guild-constitution-class-integrity-dashboard-mika-2026-05-18.md)

## Non-goals

- Forcing every codebase artifact to be regeneratable in every language (the chain establishes capability; per-artifact scope is incremental)
- Building automated cross-language code-synthesis tooling day-one (round-trip verification first; auto-synthesis can grow over time)
- Requiring the spec layer to be in a specific language (Lean / TLA+ / OpenSpec all valid; chain operates regardless of spec-language choice)
