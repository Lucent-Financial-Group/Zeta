# B-0409 — Peer-call TS audit (duplication after migration)

## Source

Child of B-0120. Rule 0 (TS over bash) + trajectory shows peer-call cluster complete in .ts. Audit first to avoid re-porting the old shape.

## What

One-pass read-only audit of the three .ts peer-call entrypoints. Identify:

- Persona bootstrap code (CURRENT-*.md load, four-ferry preamble)
- Invocation sites inside tools/ and .github/
- Exact duplication points between grok/gemini/codex

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] 1-page markdown report committed listing duplicated blocks + line ranges
- [ ] Current persona-call surfaces enumerated: amara/ani wrappers plus grok/gemini/codex entrypoints
- [ ] No code changes; pure survey

## Out of scope

- No implementation
- No bash scripts
- No new personas

This child is the ignition for the refactor: know the current TS substrate before extracting.
