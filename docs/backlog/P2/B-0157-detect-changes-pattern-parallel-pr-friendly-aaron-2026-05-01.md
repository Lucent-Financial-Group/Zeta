# detect-changes pattern — per-change-class workflow gating

## Origin

Aaron 2026-05-01, in two related memos:

- `memory/feedback_prefer_mechanical_external_anchors_over_aaron_as_anchor_aaron_2026_05_01.md` — names B-0157 in the investment-direction section: *"when building substrate-discipline mechanizations (per B-0153 lint suite, B-0156 TS port, B-0157 detect-changes pattern), spend the effort on PRECISION not on coverage-breadth"*
- `memory/feedback_detect_changes_pattern_sibling_repo_parallel_optimized_external_anchor_aaron_2026_05_01.md` — full pattern source from sibling-repo direct inspection: *"`../no-copy-only-learning-agents-insight` is the best repo in github i've seen setup to be parallel"*

ID was reserved 2026-05-01; per-row file was never filed. Otto 2026-05-03 audit pass (post-B-0141 + post-B-0142 filings) found B-0157 still missing — third concrete hit for B-0177's audit hypothesis.

## The problem

Current Zeta CI runs ALL workflows on every PR regardless of whether the PR's changes are relevant to each workflow. Examples:

- A docs-only PR triggers `dotnet build`, F# analyzer runs, .NET tests — none of which can be affected by docs changes
- A backlog-row-only PR triggers markdown lint, semgrep, CodeQL — only markdown lint is relevant
- A workflow-config PR triggers everything in the relevant matrix even though the change might be limited to one workflow file

**Effect**: CI churn proportional to (open PRs) × (number of workflows), independent of (changes per PR). Parallel-PR friendliness is bounded by total CI capacity, not by relevance.

**Partial pre-existence** (post-merge review correction): some gating already exists — `gate.yml` skips build/test on docs-only PRs; `codeql.yml` short-circuits pure docs changes via `path-gate`; backlog-only changes have a `backlog-index-integrity` check. This row generalizes the partial pattern into a uniform mechanism, NOT introduces gating from zero.

## What this row builds

The sibling-repo's detect-changes pattern (`../no-copy-only-learning-agents-insight`) — adapted for Zeta. **Note (post-merge review correction)**: GitHub Actions `needs:` works only within a single workflow file (`jobs.<job_id>.needs`), NOT across workflow files. The cross-workflow gating must use one of three architectures:

**Architecture A — Reusable workflow** (`workflow_call`):

A `detect-changes.yml` reusable workflow declares outputs; each downstream workflow calls it via `uses: ./.github/workflows/detect-changes.yml` and gates jobs on the called workflow's outputs. Cleanest separation; matches sibling-repo pattern.

**Architecture B — Per-workflow detect-job**:

Each downstream workflow includes a small `detect-changes` job at the top that emits the change-class outputs; subsequent jobs in the same workflow gate on `needs: detect-changes`. Duplicated per workflow but no cross-workflow coordination needed.

**Architecture C — Single consolidated workflow**:

Collapse all gated workflows into one mega-workflow with a top-level `detect-changes` job + per-class job. Simplest semantics but loses workflow-file separation.

**Recommended**: Architecture A (reusable workflow) — matches sibling-repo pattern, preserves separation, and gate-on-outputs semantics are well-supported in GitHub Actions.

Per-class outputs:

- `dotnet-src-changed: true|false`
- `fsharp-src-changed: true|false`
- `tools-ts-changed: true|false`
- `docs-changed: true|false`
- `workflows-changed: true|false`
- etc. (one output per change class)

**Required-checks list** still includes all gated workflows; gate reports SUCCESS-skipped if not relevant. Per GitHub's required-checks semantics, a skipped-but-required check still counts as passing.

## Composes with

- **B-0125 (skip-fsharp-analyze on docs-only PRs)**: specific instance of the general pattern this row builds
- **B-0153 (pre-commit lint suite)**: detect-changes-gated lint runs reduce per-PR CI burden
- **B-0156 (TypeScript standardization for non-install scripts)**: TS port composes with detect-changes — TS-only changes don't trigger F# workflows
- **B-0177 (audit memos for misfiled backlog)**: this row's existence IS the third empirical hit for B-0177's audit hypothesis (sibling to B-0141 + B-0142)

## Why this is M-effort

- `detect-changes.yml` reusable workflow: ~50-100 lines of YAML (`.yml` matches the repo's existing convention; all `.github/workflows/` files use `.yml` not `.yaml`)
- Per-workflow gating: each existing workflow needs a `needs: detect-changes` + `if: needs.detect-changes.outputs.<class> == 'true'` condition (small per workflow; cumulative ~15-42 workflows)
- Test fixtures: docs-only PR / fsharp-only PR / mixed PR each verify gating works
- Required-checks list audit: ensure required-but-skipped checks still produce passing status
- Edge cases: workflow-config-changes-but-no-source-changes; merge-queue interaction; force-push edge cases

## Open design questions (NOT for this row; for the design pass)

1. **Granularity**: how fine-grained should change classes be? (Sibling repo has ~10-15; too granular = brittle; too coarse = ineffective)
2. **Workflow-config-changes**: when `.github/workflows/X.yml` itself changes, should X run regardless of source-class?
3. **Path-filter vs detect-changes**: GitHub's native `paths:` filter is simpler but doesn't compose well with required-checks; detect-changes is more code but composes cleanly
4. **Migration sequence**: phase-1 (detect-changes only, no gating yet) vs phase-2 (gating enabled); how to validate empirically before flip
5. **Rollback discipline**: if detect-changes mis-classifies, what's the fallback? (Manual override label? Force-all-workflows mode?)

## Why this matters

The sibling-repo's detect-changes pattern enables parallel-PR-friendly CI: PRs only run workflows their changes need. Effect: CI throughput scales with (changes per PR) × (workflows for those changes), not (open PRs) × (all workflows). For a multi-PR autonomous-loop session like the current one, the difference is substantial.

Composes with the alignment-frontier framing: substrate-quality CI is alignment-frontier substrate. The CI pipeline IS part of the substrate's connective tissue; reducing CI churn reduces friction in the friction → substrate → less-future-friction superfluid amortized-speed loop (per CLAUDE.md).

## Carved sentence

**"detect-changes pattern: per-PR detect-changes workflow emits per-change-class outputs; downstream workflows gate on those outputs. Result: PRs only run workflows their changes need. CI throughput scales with relevance, not with PR count. Composes with B-0125 (specific instance: skip fsharp on docs-only), B-0153 (lint suite), B-0156 (TS port). Sibling-repo pattern source preserved at `memory/feedback_detect_changes_pattern_sibling_repo_parallel_optimized_external_anchor_aaron_2026_05_01.md`. Third concrete hit for B-0177 audit hypothesis."**
