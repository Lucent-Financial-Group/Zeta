# B-0337 — Memory trust-calculus calibration

## Parent

B-0190 Step 8 (memory trust-calculus calibration).

## What

The substrate-encoding-bypasses-trust-calculus claim (PR #1552)
needs operational measurement. Build a measurable signal for
cross-instance memory transmission fidelity:

1. **Test protocol** — a fresh agent instance loads CLAUDE.md +
   N random memory files; measure whether it can answer:
   - What is the carved sentence for file X?
   - What does file Y compose with?
   - What correction does feedback file Z encode?
2. **Baseline measurement** — run the protocol 5 times, record
   accuracy.
3. **Compare load-bearing vs decorative** — do load-bearing
   files (per B-0332) transmit better than decorative ones?

## Why P2

Research-grade measurement. The factory operates without this;
the measurement informs future memory architecture decisions.

## Why depends on B-0332

The load-bearing classification provides the comparison groups
for the measurement.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Test protocol documented in a `docs/research/` file.
2. At least one baseline measurement run completed.
3. Results reported with accuracy numbers.

## Prior art

- PR #1552 — the originating claim.
