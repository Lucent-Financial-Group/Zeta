# Long-tail external-anchor cadenced sweep

Define and integrate a cadenced sweep procedure for
external-anchor coverage across the ~930 memory files and
~358 docs/research/ files. This is Phase 3 of B-0060 —
ongoing, not a one-shot.

## Approach

1. Add an `--sweep N` flag to the external-anchor coverage
   scanner (B-0311) that samples every Nth file.
2. Wire the sweep into an existing cadence tool or the
   razor-cadence workflow as an optional check.
3. Each sweep iteration:
   - Pick the next batch of memory/research files.
   - For each file with a load-bearing concept and no
     external anchor, flag as `anchor-pending`.
   - Log sweep progress so subsequent iterations continue
     where the last left off.

## Scope boundary

This row covers the SETUP of the cadence (the tool flag +
the wiring), not the execution of all ~1288 files. Execution
is ongoing cadenced work after setup lands.

## Composes with B-0090

B-0090 (cadenced lost-substrate recovery audit) already
defines a cadence pattern for sweeping memory files. This
row adds the external-anchor dimension to that sweep.

## Done-criteria

- [ ] `--sweep N` flag added to audit_external_anchors.ts.
- [ ] Sweep progress tracking (file or JSON state) so
      iterations resume.
- [ ] Integration point documented (razor-cadence or
      standalone invocation).
- [ ] Tests cover sweep-resume behavior.
- [ ] Build gate passes.
