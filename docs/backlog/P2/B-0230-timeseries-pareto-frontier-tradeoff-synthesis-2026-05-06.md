# B-0230 - Pareto frontier and tradeoff synthesis

Synthesize the B-0147 research slices into an explicit Pareto
frontier.

## Work scope

For each defensible candidate or native design point, name
what it gains, preserves, and sacrifices. The synthesis must
answer the load-bearing question: can Zeta get better
properties without losing the good properties that existing
systems earned honestly?

## Acceptance criteria

- Candidate tradeoffs are explained by design context, not
  dismissed as mistakes.
- Dominated options are marked as dominated.
- Any deliberate non-Pareto choice is labeled with the
  architectural reason.
- The synthesis directly feeds the recommendation in B-0231.
