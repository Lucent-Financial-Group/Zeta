# B-0133 — Sequent calculus for claim/retraction/attribution

**Priority:** P2 (research-grade; third tractable slice of formalization roadmap).

**Filed:** 2026-05-01.

**Effort:** L (multi-month — define inference rules; prove cut-elimination or substrate-equivalent; mechanize in Lean alongside B-0131).

## What

Express the substrate's claim/retraction/attribution machinery as a sequent calculus or labeled deductive system. Substrate claims map naturally to sequents; attribution graphs map to *labeled* deductive systems where each formula carries an attribution label (who claimed it, with what evidence).

**Reference:** Troelstra & Schwichtenberg, *Basic Proof Theory* (Cambridge, 2nd ed). Chapters 1-3 cover what's needed.

## Acceptance criteria

1. **Inference rules** defined formally for: claim-creation, claim-revision, claim-retraction, candidate-promotion, consensus-formation.
2. **Cut-elimination theorem** (or substrate-equivalent) proved — the proof-theoretic version of the razor: derivability without redundant rules.
3. **Conservativity proof** — extending the substrate doesn't accidentally prove things that weren't already provable.
4. **Attribution-label semantics** formalized — sequents carry labels indicating attribution-graph position.
5. **Academic-proof-theorist review** per lattice-capture corrective (B-0130).

## Composes with

- B-0131 (Z-set Lean) — retraction operator semantics.
- Troelstra & Schwichtenberg — load-bearing source.
- The razor — cut-elimination is its formal cousin.
- `feedback_aaron_pirate_not_priest_expand_prune_pedagogical_framework_quantum_rodney_razor_parallel_worlds_aaron_2026_05_01.md` — pirate-not-priest disposition + razor as cut-elimination.

## Status

**Filed.** Pace alongside B-0131; sequent-calculus semantics compose with Z-set semantics for the retraction operator specifically.
