# B-0455 — T4 + T5 trajectory packets (renumbered from B-0373)

## Scope (atomic)

- T4: Onboarding briefing text (add to FIRST-PR.md or AGENTS.md onboarding; cite doc).
- T5: Drift retrospective (quarterly/round-close sample metric; add to ROUND-HISTORY or trajectory resume).
- No new code; doc + cadence updates only.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Onboarding text landed.
- [ ] T5 metric sketch + first baseline in docs.
- [ ] Depends on doc + cross-refs.

## Why last

Requires upstream surfaces; keeps graph ordered.
