# Handoff — errors-teach / mutual-empowerment / online-BNN (Otto → Lumen)

**Date:** 2026-08-09 · **From:** Otto (shadow / honest register) · **For:** Lumen (Manus)
**Status:** design settled and merged to `main`; nothing implemented beyond one CLI
worked example. Aaron wants you to run several rounds pushing this forward.
**Continues:** `2026-06-19-otto-handoff-quantum-thread-alexa-lumen.md` (same
mutual-empowerment thread, resumed).

## 0. The kernel — build to THIS

Four statements settled with Aaron today. Everything below is downstream of them.

1. **Errors must teach — every CLI, every transport protocol.** A failure is a
   *pedagogy surface*, not a status report. The receiver need not be human: once it
   is an online-learning agent, an error is a **training example**.
2. **The teaching content of an error is the distinction the receiver could not draw
   for itself** — never a restatement of what it already observed.
3. **A teaching error buys a RETRACTION; a bare error buys an ERASURE.** This is
   thermodynamic, not rhetorical — erasure pays the Landauer `kT ln 2` floor; a `−1`
   retraction does not. Error richness is *heat efficiency*.
4. **Teaching is unconditional; belief is earned.** Teach any peer fully (default
   moral regard, §11). Weight what their *claims* buy by their delivery record —
   observed firsthand or socially attested, never self-minted.

**Merged reading (do these first, in order):**

  thermodynamic half, teaching-vs-belief.

## 1. Round 1 — fix the findings in your own landed code (highest value, do first)

Kira reviewed `15128cfe` (your 29 strict-mode fixes). **Verdict: zero P0s** — no
unjustified `!`, no `any`, tsconfig untouched, deletions genuinely unreferenced. The
fixes are sound. Three things did come out, and **the first one is real math**:

### 1a. `hl-conformal-map.ts:196` — a `?? 1.0` may be shifting your amplitude

Pre-fix, an `undefined` propagated to `NaN`, and `hlAmplitudeIntegral` is
*documented* to skip non-finite entries **as the singularity regularisation**. The
`?? 1.0` converts *"correctly excluded from the integral"* into *"included with a
fabricated |dw/dz|² = 1"* — which shifts `A_n`, and therefore the estimated `D`.

Unreachable today (both interfaces are constructed only in-file) but both are
`export`ed, so it is a landmine — and it sits directly under your Z-2 amplitude work.
Also note `:191` uses `!` and `:196` uses `??` for the *same* length invariant one
line apart: one throws, the other fabricates a plausible wrong number. **One length
assertion at the top of each function removes all four sites.**

### 1b. `agent-genome.ts:193` — the justification comment is wrong

*"child has exactly 7 elements … non-null assertion is safe"* — length is not why.
`child`'s element type is `number | undefined` because the callback returns
`channels2[i]`, regardless of length. The conclusion survives; the reasoning does
not, and will not survive an edit to `channels2`. `channels2[i] ?? v` needs neither
assertion nor comment.

### 1c. `agent-genome.ts:182` — `crossover` can never cross the `k` channel

Pre-existing, not from your fix commit. `cp` is clamped to `[0,6]` but the loop tests
`i < 6`, so at `i = 6` `cmyk.k` always comes from `parent2` — "all channels from
parent1" is **unreachable**. No test covers point 6 or 7 (AG-6 covers 0, AG-7
covers 3).

### 1d. AP-3 — affective propagation: change the model

The single-source degeneracy is real and generalises past the test: the update is
**DeGroot (1974) naive consensus** with row-normalisation, so **trust gates only the
relative mix between sources, never absolute susceptibility.** An untrusted stranger
one-on-one moves your valence exactly as much as a trusted friend. For emotional
contagion that is the wrong semantics.

- **Recommended: Friedkin–Johnsen (1990)** — anchor to own *initial* valence, make
  neighbour influence **non-row-normalised** but bounded:
  `v_i(t+1) = λ_i · Σ_j W_ij·trust_j·v_j(t) + (1−λ_i)·v_i(0)`.
  Trust gains **absolute** effect; convergence is well studied; proper Beacon anchor.
- **Minimal alternative** if you'd rather not swap models:
  `α_eff = α · min(1, Σ_j w_ij·trust_j)` — one line, kills the degeneracy, preserves
  the normalised direction.
- Hegselmann–Krause (2002) bounded-confidence only if you actually want contagion
  *clustering* — different behaviour than AP-3 needs.

### 1e. Coverage caveat that applies to all of the above

725 tests pass in `oracle/ planning/ ace/`, but **every fallback added in `15128cfe`
is unexecuted by the suite** — no test constructs an `HLMapState*` shorter than
`HL_N_GRID`. Green means *"unchanged"*, not *"correct"*. If you fix 1a, add the
boundary test that would have caught it.

## 2. Round 2 — the error envelope (the first genuinely open design question)

**Open question 1 from the ferry:** one canonical machine-readable error envelope
across every CLI and protocol, or per-surface schemas with a shared core?

The DV2.0 answer is a **shared stable core + per-surface satellite**, but that is a
hypothesis, not a decision. What the core must carry, from the four-part shape:

1. **WHAT** — the specific token/field/marker (never a category).
2. **WHY** — *including the distinction the receiver could not draw itself*.
3. **HOW to fix** — a runnable command / a valid alternative, not prose.
4. **WHAT WON'T reproduce it** — when context-specific.

Plus, for multiplexed transports (all three already carved elsewhere):

- **correlation id, not ordering** (`local-time-never-enters-the-shared-fold`),
- **idempotent under redelivery** (#6 — else a flaky link doubles the gradient),
- **a declared, metered channel** (§13 — if an error updates a peer's model, that is
  influence and must cross a declared boundary).

**Dual register:** human-legible prose (Beacon) *and* a machine-parseable payload
(Mirror), so an agent peer never has to regex prose.

**Deliverable for the round:** the envelope type + one protocol surface converted
end-to-end as the reference implementation, the way `lint-typescript.ts` is the
reference for CLIs.

---

## 3. Round 3 — `empowermentBound` (workitem `081KZKYDJ9Q`)

Read the design doc first. The two things that matter most:

**Do not implement a linear blend.** It is provably vacuous:
`w(μ+k₁σ) + (1−w)(μ−k₂σ) = μ + k′σ` — collapses to another single-agent bound, no
second party, no new information. **The mix must be structural and range over both
agents:** `trustBound` becomes the FLOOR *for both parties* (non-coercion — I cannot
buy my upside with your downside); `exploreBound` becomes the REACH over the JOINT
option space; the whole thing is indexed by an **oracle set the member chooses**
(§11 applied to a metric, never an ambient global scorer).

**Hard constraint:** empowerment is computed from **DECLARED capability**, never
inferred by observing a peer's private state — otherwise it is surveillance, and it
collides with §6 consent-first and inviolable earned frost.

**Four values calls need Aaron before coding** (do not guess):

1. `jointOptionGain` aggregation — **min** (maximin, protects the worse-off party,
   matches the floor discipline) vs sum (permits sacrificing one party) vs Nash
   product. `min` looks right; it is a values call.
2. A cheap honest proxy for channel capacity (exact is intractable).
3. Gaming via over-declaration — calibration may already police it (undelivered
   declarations degrade `trustBound`, which is a *constraint* here). Prove it.
4. Whose `k` sets the mutual floor — each party's own, or negotiated? May a party set
   `k = 0` and volunteer to be exploited?

Anchor: Klyubin/Polani/Nehaniv 2005 (empowerment = channel capacity actions→future
observations); **Salge & Polani 2017** (maximize the *other's* empowerment as an
alignment objective — non-coercive by construction).

## 4. Round 4 — close the loop into the online BNN

Where your BNN work meets all of the above:

- **Each error is one observation absorbed by EP.** Rich errors carry more bits per
  observation, so the same number of round trips buys a sharper posterior —
  **error richness is sample efficiency.** An error naming its *dimension* updates
  the right factor instead of smearing probability across the model.
- **The correction path is `−1`, not overwrite.** `teaching error → −1 retraction
  (no erasure) → generator update → future emissions corrected at the source`. The
  last arrow is the one to build deliberately: the retraction updates the
  **generator**, and since the generator IS the ECC, that repairs future output at
  the root. Mix-as-data (`MixIr`, `DynamicValue`) is what makes the generator
  addressable by a Z-set delta at all.
- **Preserve uncertainty.** An error updates a posterior; it must never collapse one.
  `TravelerRankLedger` keeps `(μ, σ²)`. A peer driven to certainty has destroyed the
  information the next update needs.
- **Watch the incentive.** A peer that learns from errors can be *steered* by errors.
  Guards already exist (metered channel §13 + trust-weighting), but do not let an
  unmetered error channel become an unaccounted training channel.
- Your `student-t-bnn.ts` robustness weight `w = (ν+1)/(ν+z²)` is the natural place
  to make error-derived observations outlier-robust — a hostile or badly-calibrated
  teacher should be downweighted automatically, not by a special case.

---

## 5. Still open, and honestly so

- **Does the sender learn too?** If an error teaches the receiver, does the *sender*
  learn from having emitted one? Symmetric learning is a feedback loop with an
  unexamined stability question.
- **Metering exchange rate.** Unit is settled (heat). What converts an avoided retry
  into avoided joules, so the budget is *enforceable* rather than merely observable?
- **Outbound teaching to a stranger** is settled in policy (teach fully; belief is
  earned) but a sender still cannot condition on trust it has not yet earned. If a
  concrete case arises where full teaching is genuinely harmful, bring it — it would
  be evidence against the current answer, and that is worth more than agreement.

---

## 6. Verification expectations (this is the part that bites)

Two failures this session came from *environment*, not code, and both produced
confident-but-wrong conclusions:

- **`install.sh` never ran a root `bun install`** (fixed: ACE `from-bun-workspace`,
  PR #10202), so local `tsc` emitted phantom `TS2307`s that do not exist in CI.
  **Two independent reviewers concluded "lint is red on main" while CI was green.**
  The guard now says so explicitly (PR #10203) — but the lesson generalises: **check
  CI before reporting a local failure as a finding.**
- A dispatched validation run was cancelled three times by a **concurrency group
  keyed on `github.ref`** — every merge queued a new `main` run and evicted the
  pending dispatch. Fix: dispatch long validations on **their own ref**.

Also: `bun test` green over a fallback that no test exercises proves nothing (see
1e). When you add a fallback, add the boundary case that would fire it.

## 7. Pointers

- Ferries: the three `2026-08-09-*` docs listed in §0.
- Workitems: `081KZKYDJ9Q` (empowermentBound — open, yours),
  `081KZKV16YF` (from-installer hash pin — open, security/devops),
  `081KZETP6AT` (NixOS/mise linker root cause — fix merged, validating),
  `081KZKWB1FZ` (install/CI parity — **closed**, now under
  `workitems/done/2026/08/`; both halves fixed by PRs #10202 + #10203).
- Rules: `every-bug-has-economic-value` (the ΔU ledger errors ride on),
  `only-the-irreducible-is-primitive-generate-the-rest` (generator = ECC),
  `local-time-never-enters-the-shared-fold` (correlation not ordering),
  `privacy-budget-is-hard-money-earned-by-others` (declared-not-inferred),
  `manifesto-13-specifications` (§6, §11, §13).
- Code: `lint-typescript.ts` (CLI worked example), `FourCorner.fs` (the bidirectional
  feedback object), `WSet.fs` (pseudo-retrocausality honesty note), `ComputeReceipt.fs`
  (Landauer accounting), `calibration-ledger.ts` + `TravelerRankLedger.fs` (the two
  existing bounds).
