# Install-time configuration: every value that breaks a fresh install when it is wrong

Goal this document serves: a USB installer that installs and first-boots on **somebody else's
network** with **no post-install hand-editing**. A generic installer edits no file, so any
environment-specific value that lives in the tree is *applied as written* on every install. This
is the inventory of those values, what happens when each is wrong, where its install-time source
is (or should be), and what is still open.

Audited 2026-09-30 against `origin/main` `6aac8b4d39`. Companion docs:

## The one mechanism (reused, not reinvented)

Introduced for the public domain + ACME email in #17712 (`3fa2bc325e`). Every row below that says
"install-time" uses exactly this path:

```text
zflash --<flag>  ──►  ESP /zeta-firstboot.conf  ──►  zeta-first-boot.sh `export`s it
        │                       (ZETA_<NAME>='…')              │
        └── or the installer prompt, at the START ◄────────────┘
                             │   (ESP -> prompt -> UNSET, validated, BEFORE any disk work)
                             ▼
              /mnt/etc/zeta/<file>  (written only when SET; symlinked to /etc/zeta/ for --impure eval)
                             ▼
     nixos/modules/injected-<thing>.nix reads it at Nix evaluation time, asserts its shape, and on a
     k3s server adds ONE entry to the k3s auto-deploy roster: a SEPARATE ArgoCD Application whose
     kustomize base (k8s/<thing>/) carries NO value — the value arrives only as an inline patch.
```

Three properties make it safe and are the contract for any new row:

1. **The repo carries no default.** An unset value is a *visible* state, never a placeholder.
2. **Fail loud.** A value that cannot work is refused (an ESP value with nobody to ask refuses the
   install **before the wipe**; at a console the operator is asked again). "Unknown" is never
   "permitted", and a probe that did not run says so rather than passing.
3. **A twin is parity-tested.** The shell validator in `zeta-install.sh` is replayed against a
   TypeScript oracle (`installer/*-shell-parity.test.ts`); the rendered template is mirrored in
   TypeScript (`cluster/*.ts`) and tested for SET and UNSET.

The fail-closed backstop for everything that is *not* yet injected:
`bun src/Core.TypeScript/hygiene/lint-rendered-manifest-placeholders.ts` scans every manifest the
cluster applies (and both install-time templates, *rendered*) for `example.com`, RFC 2606 TLDs,
`you@…`, `change-me`, `:placeholder` image tags and unrendered `@ZETA_…@` tokens. A finding that is
not in its baseline fails; a baseline entry that no longer matches fails too (stale).

## Status legend

| status | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **DONE (this PR)** | moved to install time / detected, with tests that fail without the change |
| **DONE (prior)** | already install-time or derived before this audit |
| **OK (default)** | environment-independent default; not a failure source |
| **OPEN (lane)** | a real defect, owned by the named lane — listed, deliberately not fixed here |
| **OPEN** | a real defect with no owner yet |
| **UNSUPPORTED** | not supported; fails loud (or should) rather than silently |

## The inventory

| # | value | where hardcoded | failure when wrong | install-time source | status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Public domain** (`portal.<d>`, `gitlab.<d>`, `registry.<d>`) | was `platform/gateway.yaml`, `portal.yaml` (`portal.example.com`) | Gateway listener/route for a name nothing resolves; ACME can never validate | `zflash --public-domain` → `ZETA_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` → `/etc/zeta/public-domain` → `injected-public-tls.nix` → `platform-public-tls` Application. RFC 2606/6762 names refused (installer **and**, as of this PR, Nix) | **DONE (prior, #17712)** |
| 2 | **ACME contact email** | was `platform/clusterissuer.yaml` (`you@example.com`) | Let's Encrypt `invalidContact`; ArgoCD waits on issuer health forever → whole `platform` never applies | `zflash --acme-email` → `ZETA_ACME_EMAIL` → `/etc/zeta/acme-email` → same module | **DONE (prior, #17712)** |
| 3 | **Cilium LoadBalancer address range** (LB-IPAM pool) | `k8s/applications/cilium-lb-ipam/ip-pool.yaml` = `192.168.1.240–250` (**removed**) | On any other subnet Cilium assigns addresses no router knows, announces ARP for them, and reports the Service healthy: portal gateway + GitLab unreachable, nothing says why | `zflash --lb-pool auto\|<first>-<last>` → `ZETA_LB_POOL` → installer validates against the **measured** LAN (inside subnet; not network/broadcast/node/gateway; not pod/service/segment CIDR; **not already answering ping**) → `/etc/zeta/lb-pool` → `injected-lb-pool.nix` → `cilium-lb-ipam-pool` Application (`k8s/lb-ipam/`). Prompt offers `.240–.250` of the node's /24 only on an explicit `y`; with nobody to ask it is UNSET **loudly** (no pool, banner says Services stay `<pending>`) | **DONE (this PR)** |
| 4 | **Pod / service CIDR vs the host LAN** | derived from `clusterName` (`cluster-identity.json`): pod `10.143.0.0/17`, service `10.99.192.0/19` for `zeta`; Cilium `ipv4NativeRoutingCIDR` restates it | A 10.x site LAN that overlaps either swallows traffic to those LAN hosts into the overlay: pods get addresses, nothing crashes, packets never arrive. The derivation reserves `192.168/16` and `172.16/12` but **not** other 10.x | **Detection**, not injection (see "why not injectable"): the installer reads the node's routed networks and refuses **before the wipe** (`ZETA_ALLOW_CIDR_OVERLAP=1` overrides, named in the refusal); re-checks against the *cloned* tree's `clusterName`. The ISO ships `/etc/zeta-cluster-identity.json` so the pre-wipe check knows the name | **DONE (this PR)** |
| 5 | **L2 announcement NIC regex** | `cilium-lb-ipam/l2-policy.yaml` was `^en[ops].*`, `^eth[0-9]+` | A node whose wired NIC is a USB/Thunderbolt adapter (`enx<mac>`) announced nothing: LB IPs never answered ARP | widened to `^en.*` (every predictable ethernet name, incl. `enx*`); Wi-Fi deliberately excluded (APs commonly drop an ARP reply for a second address behind one client MAC - unverified on this hardware) | **DONE (this PR)** |
| 6 | **GitLab LAN address** (`global.hosts.gitlab/registry.name` + the `gitlab-lan` Gateway `addresses`) | `applications/gitlab/Application.yaml`: was the literal `192.168.1.250` in 3 places; now the RFC 5737 sentinel `192.0.2.250` | Outside a pool containing `.250` (every LAN but one) `gitlab-lan` stayed `<pending>`: GitLab unreachable on the LAN | the **last address of row 3's resolved range**: Job `gitlab-lan-address` in `cilium-lb-ipam-pool` merge-patches three `valuesObject` leaves; the Gateway reads `global.zeta.lanAddress` via `tpl`; root ignores exactly those paths; disjoint from the public-TLS Job's `parameters` | **DONE (this PR stack)** |
| 7 | **GitLab external URL** (public) / hostnames | `applications/gitlab/Application.yaml` (`global.hosts.*`), `domain: gitlab.invalid` sentinel | wrong URL ⇒ wrong clone URLs, OAuth redirects, runner `CI_SERVER_URL` | public domain (row 1) patched in by `gitlab-public-hosts` Job; LAN mode uses the pinned address (row 6). `gitlab.invalid` is a deliberate never-resolves sentinel and is baselined in the lint | **DONE (prior, #17737)** for public; **OPEN (gitlab lane)** for LAN |
| 8 | **GitLab root password / initial token** | `global.initialRootPassword.secret: gitlab-initial-root-password` | a known default password on the instance admin | minted by `bootstrap/internal-secret-seeding.yaml` (generated, not in git) | **DONE (prior)** — retrieval step is the gitlab lane's |
| 9 | **Runner concurrency / tags** | GitLab runner values in the gitlab Application (`kubernetes,zeta-cluster` tags are an *operator step*); ARC `arc-runner-set` `minRunners: 1` / `maxRunners: 6`, `runnerScaleSetName`, `githubConfigUrl: https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group`, secret `arc-github-app` | ARC: org URL is Lucent-specific and the GitHub-App secret is operator-supplied, so the scale set cannot register elsewhere; `maxRunners` beyond the node budget leaves runners `Pending` | none | **OPEN (gitlab/runner lane)** — listed, not touched |
| 10 | **Node hostname** | flake host `networking.hostName = "control-plane"` | every node built from that host is `control-plane`: mDNS collision, confusing logs | `zflash --host`, else a per-install `node-<6hex>` (R4 re-pave reuses the recovered id) → `/etc/zeta/cluster-node-id` → `injected-hostname.nix` | **DONE (prior)** |
| 11 | **Node IP / NIC / VIP** | k3s chooses by default route; no `--node-ip`; joiner segment `10.88.0.0/24` derived (`injected-cluster-address.nix`) | a node with two default-capable NICs (e.g. Ethernet + Wi-Fi) can advertise the wrong address; the API cert SANs only `control-plane` + k3s defaults, so `kubectl` by IP from elsewhere fails TLS | joiner addressing: `zeta-firstboot.conf` (§5b). Single-node: none needed | **OK (default)** for single node; **OPEN** for dual-NIC |
| 12 | **DNS resolvers** | none hardcoded — DHCP; CoreDNS forwards to host `resolv.conf` | a LAN whose DHCP hands out no resolver: installer cannot clone (caught), or pods have no DNS | installer preflight `git ls-remote $REPO_URL` + binary-cache probe exercise DNS **before the wipe**. No override | **OK (default)**: fails loud pre-wipe; no static-resolver injection |
| 13 | **NTP** | NixOS default `timesyncd` + `nixos.pool.ntp.org` | UDP/123 blocked ⇒ skewed clock ⇒ TLS (ACME, registries, GitHub) fails. The pre-wipe repo preflight prints the machine clock when it fails | none | **OK (default)** |
| 14 | **Timezone / locale** | `common.nix` `time.timeZone = lib.mkDefault "America/New_York"`, `i18n.defaultLocale = "en_US.UTF-8"`; installer ISO same | cosmetic: log timestamps and cron-style schedules read in the wrong zone. Never a failure | none (`mkDefault`, so a host can override) | **OK (default)** |
| 15 | **HTTP(S) proxy** | not supported anywhere (no `networking.proxy`, no containerd/k3s proxy drop-in) | behind a mandatory proxy the installer cannot reach GitHub (**bails pre-wipe, loudly**) and a hand-fixed node still cannot pull images | none | **UNSUPPORTED** (fails loud) |
| 16 | **Registry mirror** | `k8s/registry-mirrors.json` → `k3s-registry-mirrors.nix`: `mirror.gcr.io` for `docker.io` | a network that blocks `mirror.gcr.io`: containerd is expected to fall back to Docker Hub (k3s docs; not exercised here) with rate-limit risk on first boot, not a hard failure | none; single source of truth shared with the coverage probe | **OK (default)** |
| 17 | **Cluster join token / endpoint** | none in tree | joiner founds a rival cluster instead of joining | `zflash --role joiner --join-server-url --join-token` (§5, §5c, §6); shape enforced twice (`K10<hash>::…`); datastore + join-intent preflights | **DONE (prior)** |
| 18 | **Admin SSH keys** | `operator-ssh-keys.txt` (fallback); `PasswordAuthentication = false` | no key ⇒ no remote login; the console password is the only way in | `zflash --ssh-key` (default `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`) → `/zeta-authorized-keys.pub` | **DONE (prior)** |
| 19 | **`zeta` console password** | `initial-password.nix` default hash of a well-known string | a known password at the **console** (ssh password auth is off) when the installer prompt is skipped, which the zero-typing path always does | `read -s` prompt (never on the ESP, by the constitutional rail) | **OPEN** (security: generate-and-print instead of a known default) |
| 20 | **Wi-Fi credentials** | none in tree | no network ⇒ no install | console `nmtui`; **or** `--wifi-*` onto the ESP **in plaintext** (INJECTION-POINTS §4a divergence, recorded and unresolved) | **DONE (prior)** with a recorded rail divergence |
| 21 | **Longhorn disk selection** | installer enumerates internal, non-hotplug disks; WP28 sizing; extra non-blank disks need consent (#17747) | wiping/adopting the wrong disk; Longhorn starved on a big single disk | installer, with `LONGHORN1_TAIL`, `ZETA_LONGHORN_EXTRA_DISKS`; refusals before the wipe | **DONE (prior)** |
| 22 | **Repo URL / revision ArgoCD tracks** | every `Application`: `repoURL: https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta`, `targetRevision: main` (incl. `root-application.yaml`, both install-time templates) | no route to GitHub / a fork / a private mirror ⇒ nothing syncs; and the node's NixOS is pinned to the **ISO commit** while the cluster follows **`main` HEAD** — the two drift apart | `REPO_URL` and `ZETA_ISO_COMMIT` pin the *installer's* clone only; nothing pins the cluster's revision | **OPEN** — the largest remaining environment coupling; not addressed here |
| 23 | **Headscale server URL / tailnet domain** | `applications/headscale/configmap.yaml`: `server_url: https://headscale.zeta.local`, `base_domain: tailnet.zeta.local` | `.local` is mDNS-only; no client off the LAN can reach the control server | should derive from the public domain (row 1) | **OPEN** |
| 24 | **Blueprint `postgres` default password** | `applications/platform/blueprints.yaml` `PASSWORD` default `change-me` | every instance that does not set one has a known password | none | **OPEN (workloads lane)** — baselined in the lint with owner |
| 25 | **hat-system operator image tag** | `applications/hat-system/deployment.yaml` image `…:placeholder` | `ImagePullBackOff` on a fresh install | none | **OPEN (workloads lane)** — baselined in the lint with owner |
| 26 | **Dynamic DNS hosts / registrar secret** | `applications/ddns/cronjob.yaml` `DDNS_HOSTS: "@ *"`; secret `namecheap-ddns` (operator-supplied) | updates the wrong records, or fails without the secret | none | **OPEN** (operator step) |

## Why the pod/service CIDR is detected, not injected (row 4)

`cluster-identity.json` says it plainly: Cilium's `clusterPoolIPv4PodCIDRList` /
`ipv4NativeRoutingCIDR` live in checked-in YAML that ArgoCD reconciles **from git**, so a per-USB
cluster name could not move them — an injected name would put the CNI on one network and k3s on
another with nothing to say so. So the lever is *detection*: refuse the install while refusing is
free, and name the two real remedies (renumber the network, or change `clusterName` and rebuild).
`lint-cluster-cidr-agreement.ts` and the assertions in `cluster-network.nix` keep every surface
consistent after such an edit.

## What the installer does now (rows 3–4), in order

All of it runs at **Step 0.5/0.6, before disk enumeration** — nothing has been wiped when any of
these refuse.

1. `zeta_lan_detect` measures the interface that owns the route to the internet: address, prefix,
   gateway (`ip -4 -o route get 1.1.1.1`, `ip -4 -o addr show dev …`). If it cannot, it says so and
   every later check is marked **degraded** — never silently skipped.
2. The cluster's derived pod/service CIDR (`zeta_cluster_cidrs`, a shell twin replayed against
   `nixos/tests/cluster-cidr-golden-vectors.json`) and the inter-node segment are compared with
   every network the node can already route to. Overlap ⇒ **refuse**.
3. `ZETA_LB_POOL` from the ESP is validated and probed; a value that cannot work **refuses the
   install** when nobody can be asked, and re-asks at a console. `auto` derives `.240–.250` of the
   node's /24 and refuses if the window is not clear.
4. No ESP value: a console is asked (a one-keypress gate on the zero-typing first-boot path,
   `LB_POOL_PROMPT_SECS`, default 20 s); nobody there ⇒ **UNSET, loudly**.
5. After the clone, the collision and the range are re-checked against the **cloned** tree's
   `clusterName`, because the ISO's copy may be older than `main`.

## Operator quick reference

```text
zflash --lb-pool 192.168.1.240-192.168.1.250    # explicit, validated against the LAN at install
zflash --lb-pool auto                           # .240-.250 of the node's /24; refused if in use
(no flag)                                       # prompt at a console; else UNSET, loudly
ZETA_ALLOW_CIDR_OVERLAP=1                       # install despite a pod/service-vs-LAN overlap (named in the refusal)
LB_POOL_PROMPT_SECS=60                          # widen the first-boot keypress window
# after install, on the control plane:
echo '192.168.1.240-192.168.1.250' | sudo tee /etc/zeta/lb-pool
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --impure --flake /etc/zeta/full-ai-cluster#<host>
sudo k3s kubectl get ciliumloadbalancerippool zeta-lb-pool
```

The range must be **free addresses on the node's LAN and outside the router's DHCP range**. The
ping probe is evidence, not proof: a host that does not answer ICMP is invisible to it.

## Not verified (stated, not implied)

- **Nothing here has been booted.** No nix and no QEMU were available; the Nix module
  (`injected-lb-pool.nix`) and the new assertions in `injected-public-tls.nix` are checked by review
  and by tests on their *text* (`cluster/lb-ipam-pool.test.ts`), not evaluated. `nixos-install`
  with a real `/etc/zeta/lb-pool` is the first real exercise.
- That ArgoCD's bundled kustomize applies the inline JSON6902 patch as `cluster/lb-ipam-pool.ts`
  mirrors it, and that Cilium accepts a `CiliumLoadBalancerIPPool` created with `spec: {}` plus a
  `blocks` patch (the base is never applied alone).
- That a real `ip -4 -o route get` / `addr show` prints exactly the fixtures' shape on the live ISO.
- Existing nodes: `cilium-lb-ipam` has `prune: false`, so an already-applied `zeta-lb-pool` is not
  deleted when `ip-pool.yaml` leaves git — but a node flashed from an *older* ISO has no
  `lb-pool` file either, and keeps the old pool only because nothing prunes it.
- Row 6: that ArgoCD honours a merge patch of three `valuesObject` leaves under `RespectIgnoreDifferences`
  (the same behaviour the public-TLS `parameters` patch already depends on), and that the `gitlab-runner`
  subchart's `tpl` sees `global.zeta` on a real sync (it does under `helm template`, which the tests render).
