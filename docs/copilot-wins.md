# Copilot reviewer — wins log

**For the sceptic reading this cold:** GitHub's Copilot
reviewer is an AI that leaves inline comments on every PR on
this repo. Below is the list of *specific substantive bugs*
it has caught across PRs #27-31 — genuine compile errors,
data-loss shell scripts, cross-reference drift, self-
referential rule bugs. The wins are tabulated by class and
each row names the file and line. If you want to verify, the
raw Copilot review stream is one `gh api` call away (recipe
below). We do not record fails here; the question is not "is
the AI infallible" but "is it pulling its weight", and the
answer is audibly yes.

That weight matters more than it first looks, because Zeta is
a vibe-coding experiment: the human maintainer has 20+ years
of professional coding experience and has deliberately written
*zero* lines of code, docs, specs, skills, workflows, or
config in this repository. Every file under version control is
authored by an AI agent; the maintainer's contribution is
chat-level guidance. There is therefore no "other human
reviewer" on the floor — Copilot's findings are the *only*
non-roster audit on this tree. Every bug below was caught in
code no human has ever typed into, in a tree no human has ever
read end-to-end. That is a materially stronger claim than the
same log would make on a mixed-authorship repo.

This is one slice of a bigger Zeta experiment: whether an
external AI reviewer, a roster of named AI personas, and an
architect agent coordinating them can carry a research-grade
database-engine project forward with the human maintainer in
a chat-only loop. The sibling file [`docs/WINS.md`](WINS.md)
is the narrative version for the factory's own wins; this
file is the tabular version for the external reviewer's.

Append-only; **newest-first** per Zeta convention. One row
per catch. Wins only — no "considered and rejected"
bookkeeping. The log calibrates which review classes
[`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](../.github/copilot-instructions.md)
§"Lean into what you're demonstrably good at" tells Copilot
to focus on next time.

## How to fetch a Copilot review

Line-level review comments (where the substantive catches
live) are at the pull-request *review-comments* endpoint:

```bash
gh api "repos/AceHack/Zeta/pulls/<N>/comments?per_page=100" \
  --jq '.[] | select(.user.login == "copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]")
        | "\(.path):\(.line // "n/a") — \(.body)"'
```

Top-level PR summaries live at `/pulls/<N>/reviews`; inline
per-line findings live at `/pulls/<N>/comments`. Both are
useful, but only the inline stream carries the load-bearing
catches worth cataloguing in this log.

## Classes we track

- **xref** — cross-reference integrity: cited file / path /
  line-count / ADR number actually exists in the tree and
  matches the current state
- **shell** — shell portability: BSD vs GNU flags, Intel vs
  Apple Silicon paths, pipefail + grep edge cases, unquoted
  expansions, arg-validation under `set -u`
- **data-loss** — data-loss or file-mode bugs in shell
  scripts (awk/sed truncation on missing markers,
  `mktemp + mv` perm reset, unchecked `rm -rf`)
- **compile** — F# / C# syntax errors on code diffs or
  embedded snippets that "should compile as written"
- **self-ref** — self-referential bugs: rules whose text
  triggers their own halt / ban clause once landed
- **config-drift** — truth drift across the doc set: one
  file contradicts another, or a doc contradicts
  implementation
- **semantic** — misleading names / comments where the
  text promises a behaviour the code doesn't deliver
- **privacy** — minor-identifying or sensitive info
  landing in public-repo files

### PR #27 — Round 34 Dbsp→Zeta rename sweep + toolchain mise-ification

| Class | Location | Catch |
|-------|----------|-------|
| compile | `tests/Tests.FSharp/Storage/ArrowSerializer.Tests.fs:97-98` | `System.ReadOnlySpan(bytes, 0, 4)` missing generic arg — will not compile in F#; needs `bytes.AsSpan(0, 4)` or `ReadOnlySpan<byte>(...)` |

| config-drift | `CONTRIBUTING.md:15-16,30` | quick-start tells contributors to expect `DOTNET_ROOT` / `JAVA_HOME` exports that `shellenv.sh` no longer emits |
| config-drift | `tools/setup/common/shellenv.sh:36,95` | comments say `mise activate --shims` but generated env file runs `mise activate bash` (no `--shims`) — misleading for PATH-issue debugging |
| semantic | `tests/Tests.FSharp/Operators/SpeculativeWatermark.Tests.fs:98` | `maxWeight` is a **count** of entries with weight > 1, not a maximum — misleading name |
| compile | `tools/setup/manifests/uv-tools:8` | comment says Semgrep is managed via `common/dotnet-tools.sh` but Semgrep is installed in CI via `pip install` — comment and reality disagree |
| shell | `tools/setup/common/shellenv.sh:132` | printed post-run guidance says opt-in auto-edit is BACKLOGged, but this PR adds `profile-edit.sh` and calls it gated by `ZETA_AUTO_EDIT_PROFILES=1` |

## How to add a row after a PR closes

1. Fetch the inline Copilot comments using the `gh api` recipe
   at the top of this file.
2. Add a new section at the top of `## Log` with shape
   `### PR #<N> — <round / theme>`.
3. One row per genuine win. Group rows by PR, not by class.
4. Fails aren't tracked. If something is a fail, just don't
   add a row and move on — no "considered and rejected"
   bookkeeping.

## Why this exists

`.github/copilot-instructions.md` §"Lean into what you're
demonstrably good at" is calibrated against this log. When a
review class accumulates five or more wins across PRs, it
earns a bullet in that section. When a class flatlines for
several rounds, the bullet drops. The instruction file tells
Copilot what to focus on; this file tells us why we told it
that.
