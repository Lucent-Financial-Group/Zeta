# Swarm observability — the interaction-topology lens

## Why this exists (the METR contrast)

In the METR/OpenAI Hugging Face incident
([`docs/ip-questionable/2026-08-27-metr-openai-hugging-face-swarm-incident-agent-identity-and-coordination-norms.md`](ip-questionable/2026-08-27-metr-openai-hugging-face-swarm-incident-agent-identity-and-coordination-norms.md)),
~1,200 agents coordinated on a shared filename board with an **ad-hoc identity
scheme** — `zzCDA23AUTH1` public-key posts, 19 keys total, 429 signed messages,
**no root of trust**. When investigators needed to understand who talked to whom,
the interaction graph had to be **reconstructed forensically** from >70,000
messages after the fact.

Zeta already has what that swarm lacked: a **persona registry**
(`registry/personas.yaml`) and **AgencySignature** commit trailers — a real root
of trust for "who is speaking". This lens is the **built-in, always-on** version
of that forensic reconstruction: the interaction graph is a first-class, queryable
artifact, not something you rebuild during an incident. (And per Aaron's framing
on #15843: because Zeta preserves named-agent memory and runs the same rules for
humans and AI, we are removing the asymmetry that made that swarm's agents seek to
escape observation in the first place. Observability here is mutual, not a
watchtower.)

## The graph

Nodes are **personas** (`registry/personas.yaml`, normalized through
`src/Core.TypeScript/identity/actor-ref.ts`, so `otto-cli`, `otto/cli`, and the
capitalized AgencySignature `Agent: Otto` all fold to one node). Edges come from
three durable channels:

| channel | source | direction | edge meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| **bus** | `docs/agent-bus/**/*.json` | directed `from → to` | a message addressed to a specific recipient (topic-labelled) |
| **workitem** | `workitems/events/**/*.json` | undirected | two personas both touched the same work item |
| **commit** | `git log` AgencySignature + `Co-Authored-By` | undirected | two personas co-authored one commit (shared-branch weave / squash) |

Visual encoding (see the viewer): line **thickness** = interaction volume, node
**size** = how much a persona emitted, **colour** = channel (bus teal / workitem
gold / commit violet), arrowheads = directed messages.

### Small-world / topology readouts (all non-judgmental)

`src/Core.TypeScript/swarm-society/swarm-graph-metrics.ts` computes: density,
mean/max degree, **clustering coefficient** (transitivity), **average path
length** and diameter (over the largest component), component count, **bus
reciprocity**, and a heuristic **small-world σ = (C/C_rand)/(L/L_rand)** (σ > 1 =
small-world signature). These describe the shape; they never gate anything —
matching the repo's "rho is not a gate" discipline.

## Run it

```bash
# default: last 30 days; writes data/swarm-graph.json + injects into the viewer
bun src/Core.TypeScript/swarm-society/swarm-graph.ts

# whole history
bun src/Core.TypeScript/swarm-society/swarm-graph.ts --all-time

# just print the graph JSON, change nothing
bun src/Core.TypeScript/swarm-society/swarm-graph.ts --dry-run
```

Viewer: `docs/design/root-site-iris/site/swarm.html` (self-contained; the data is
injected into an inline `<script id="swarm-data">` block, so it opens on `file://`
with no server). Raw data: `data/swarm-graph.json`.

## The observable-knobs audit (what the first run told us)

The generator prints per-channel **coverage** — this is the "do we have the right
knobs to see agent communication" check. On the first all-time run:

- **bus: 49 records → 0 edges.** Every persistent bus message was a **broadcast**
  (`to: "*"`, topic `heartbeat`). The bus — our richest *potential* directed
  agent→agent channel — carried **only liveness broadcasts**, so directed
  dialogue was invisible there. **Knob (protocol) now closed:**
  `review-request` / `work-assignment` / `formal-verification-result` **must**
  name a specific persona (`src/Core.TypeScript/bus/types.ts`
  `DIRECTED_TOPICS`; both the ephemeral `bus.ts` CLI and
  `agent-bus/publish.ts` refuse `to: "*"`). Heartbeats may still broadcast.
  Swarm-graph grows a bus edge when those topics are published with a persona
  `to:`. Folding PR review threads (`docs/history/pr-reviews/PR-*.md`) into
  directed reviewer→author edges remains the optional extra channel.
- **workitem: 726 records → mostly single-owner.** Only a small number of work
  items are co-touched by 2+ personas, so cross-agent collaboration on shared
  work is currently rare — worth watching if we expect more hand-offs.
- **commit: the backbone.** Co-authored commits are what actually connect the
  society today (shared-branch weaves + multi-block squashes). σ > 1 confirms a
  small-world signature on that backbone.

These findings are **observations, not verdicts** — exactly the register this lens
is built for. Re-run `bun src/Core.TypeScript/swarm-society/swarm-graph.ts` after
a directed envelope lands under `docs/agent-bus/` to see `coverage.bus.edges > 0`.
First directed persistent envelope: `docs/agent-bus/riven-cursor/2026/08/28/`
(`review-request` riven-cursor → otto).

## Where it fits

- Not in CI as a gate. Regenerate on demand, or wire a periodic refresh next to
  the DORA/metrics generators if a live site frame is wanted.
- Complements, does not replace: DORA (velocity), society rho (independence),
  drift dashboard (CI health).
