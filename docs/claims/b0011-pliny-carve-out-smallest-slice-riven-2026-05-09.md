# Claim - b0011-pliny-carve-out-smallest-slice-riven-2026-05-09

- **Session ID:** cursor/20260509T2050Z
- **Harness:** cursor
- **Claimed at:** 2026-05-09T20:50:00Z
- **ETA:** 2026-05-09T21:30:00Z
- **Scope:** Claim B-0011; take smallest safe slice = re-decompose before any wording edit (high-blast governance). Use dedicated worktree + pushed claim branch. Run focused checks (build gate, Pliny grep). Open PR for the decomp step only.
- **Durable target:** docs/backlog/P2/B-0011-pliny-carve-out-cross-surface-wording-tightening-no-verbatim-payload-excerpts.md (re-decomp note); no edits to CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/GOVERNANCE.md/memory file yet.
- **Platform mirror:** none (LFG primary)

## Notes

Cursor/Grok background worker per user_query. BEFORE steps completed: CLAUDE/AGENTS read, refresh-worldview, trajectories RESUME read, build gate 0w/0e passed in root and worktree.

One bounded step: re-decompose B-0011 (original decomp mistake: assumed single atomic PR across 4 surfaces; reality = approval gate + staged per-surface to respect Otto-300 blast-radius). This PR lands only the re-decomp + claim file. No verbatim Pliny payloads found in focused grep. All per rules: TS preference noted (no bash), worktree only, no root touch.

Focused checks outcome: build green; no "verbatim payload" in Pliny surfaces; ready for maintainer review of decomp plan.
