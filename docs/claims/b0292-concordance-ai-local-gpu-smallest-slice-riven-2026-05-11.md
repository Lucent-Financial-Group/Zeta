# Claim - b0292-concordance-ai-local-gpu-smallest-slice-riven-2026-05-11

- **Session ID:** cursor/20260511T1211Z
- **Harness:** cursor
- **Claimed at:** 2026-05-11T16:11:00Z
- **ETA:** 2026-05-11T16:30:00Z
- **Scope:** Claim B-0292; implement smallest safe slice = TS typed structure recognition surface + CPU stub in tools/concordance/concordance.ts (re-decomp already done in backlog row). Use dedicated worktree + pushed claim branch. Run focused checks (build gate, TS run). Open PR for the claim + verification step only.
- **Durable target:** tools/concordance/concordance.ts (slice already present per prior re-decomp); docs/backlog/P1/B-0292-*.md (pre-start gate satisfied); no edits to CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/GOVERNANCE.md/memory.
- **Platform mirror:** none (LFG primary)

## Notes

Riven (Grok 4.3) background worker per user_query. BEFORE steps completed: CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md read, bun tools/github/refresh-worldview.ts run, active trajectories RESUME.md read (via worktree surfaces), dotnet build -c Release passed 0w/0e in root and worktree.

One bounded step: claim the already-implemented smallest safe slice (recognizeStructure + StructurePattern stub, GPU-ready comment, pure TS no deps) via claim file + PR. Re-decomp assumption held; slice is retraction-safe pure addition. No bash; TS preferred.

Focused checks outcome: build gate 0 warnings 0 errors (repeated in worktree); bun run on concordance.ts succeeds with --json on sample files; no overlapping claims; ready for review/merge.
