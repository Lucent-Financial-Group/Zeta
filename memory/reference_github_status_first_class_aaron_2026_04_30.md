# GitHub status — first-class dependency reference

Aaron 2026-04-30 (autonomous-loop channel input, verbatim):

> looking at github status should be first class for us we live
> on git and github for now until we get a 2nd host in the future
>
> that github status page should be first class remembered
> somwehre in our repo and loop since github is our only host

The factory's hot path runs through GitHub: auto-merge, the
every-minute autonomous-loop cron, the Scorecard rolling
window, CodeQL analyses, the AceHack→LFG forward-sync flow,
Copilot/Codex PR reviews. Until a second git host exists,
**GitHub status IS factory status**.

## Canonical URLs

- **Status page (human)**: <https://www.githubstatus.com/>
- **Status API (machine)**:
  <https://www.githubstatus.com/api/v2/summary.json>

The summary.json endpoint is the freshness-check surface. It
returns:

- `status.indicator` — one of `none`, `minor`, `major`,
  `critical`, `maintenance`
- `status.description` — human-readable status (e.g.,
  "All systems operational" / "Partially Degraded Service")
- `incidents[]` — currently active incidents with name,
  status (`investigating`/`identified`/`monitoring`/`resolved`),
  impact, and incident_updates
- `components[]` — per-component status; non-`operational`
  components are the affected systems

## Factory-relevant component allowlist

These components, when degraded, directly affect the factory's
hot path. Other components (Pages, Codespaces, etc.) are not in
scope for the factory's gate-state decisions. This list is
authoritative for the freshness-check rule below — any change
to it requires Architect / human sign-off.

- **Pull Requests** — affects PR queries, thread state,
  auto-merge readiness. Degradation here can produce
  incomplete API results that fool the auto-merge pre-flight
  check.
- **Actions** — affects CI runs. Degradation here can cause
  spurious "in-progress forever" or missing-check-rollup
  states.
- **API Requests** — the entire `gh` CLI runs through this.
  Degradation here makes every gate-state poll unreliable.
- **Webhooks** — affects branch-protection check delivery.
  Degradation can mean a check that "completed" never gets
  reported back to the PR.
- **Git Operations** — the substrate layer. Degradation here
  affects push, fetch, force-push semantics.
- **Issues** — used for the dependency-status incident log
  pattern (per B-0109's design).

## Freshness-check rule (loop + investigation integration)

Aaron 2026-04-30 framed the rule across three short messages
(verbatim):

> polling github status should just be a regular part of our
> loops and investigations because all our assumptions are
> based on them being healthy today which is not always true
> as we can see todya

> every loop tick might be excessive but on some cadence or if
> you suspect issues because assumptions are not working out

The two messages compose: regular part of loops + investigations,
**but** every-tick is excessive — cadence + on-suspicion +
pre-mutation are the right shape. The freshness-check runs at
three points:

1. **On a cadence (not every tick).** Default cadence: every
   10–15 minutes when there is in-flight loop work, less
   frequently when idle. This composes with the tiered
   cadence already in the poll-the-gate rule (0–10 min
   tier, 10–30 min tier, 30+ min tier). The freshness-check
   piggybacks on the existing tiered cadence rather than
   adding its own — when the loop is in an active wait at
   the 0–10 tier, freshness-check fires on a longer
   sub-cadence (every 3–5 ticks) to avoid hitting the
   GitHub status endpoint every minute. Idle loops can
   freshness-check less frequently (every 30+ min). The
   exact cadence is tunable; the principle is "regular
   enough to catch a degradation within an hour, sparse
   enough not to be every-tick excessive."
2. **On suspicion** — whenever a loop tick is investigating an
   anomaly (slow CI, stuck PR, missing check, unexpected
   `BLOCKED` state, vanished review threads, force-push race
   conditions, "assumptions are not working out"), the
   freshness-check is the first candidate cause considered.
   *"Is GitHub currently degraded?"* is asked before *"is
   my logic wrong?"* — same shape as the
   speculation-vs-evidence discipline applied at the
   dependency layer
   (`feedback_speculation_leads_investigation_not_defines_root_cause_aaron_2026_04_28.md`).
   This is the load-bearing trigger: any time a poll result
   surprises Otto, freshness-check is non-optional.
3. **Before any mutating action** (merge, force-push,
   auto-merge arming, branch deletion, commit-then-push). This
   is the strictest gate; non-green status defers the action.
   Pre-mutation freshness-check IS every-mutation, since
   each mutation is its own freshness boundary.

The cadence trigger handles routine surveillance; the
on-suspicion trigger handles anomaly investigation; the
pre-mutation trigger handles strict gate enforcement. Each
serves a different purpose; together they cover the failure
modes without per-tick excess.

The freshness-check produces a one-of-three classification:

1. **`status.indicator == "none"` AND no incident affects
   factory-relevant components** → green; proceed with the
   mutating action per normal pre-flight rules.
2. **Any incident affects a factory-relevant component** →
   the action is **deferred** until the dependency clears.
   The conservative response taken at incident-discovery time
   (e.g., disabling auto-merge on PR #911 at 11:14Z on
   2026-04-30) is the floor; loop must not re-arm or re-issue
   mutating actions until the freshness-check returns to
   class 1.
3. **`status.indicator` non-none but no incident in
   factory-relevant components** → proceed with caution;
   record the unrelated incident in the lane-state report so
   future-Otto can correlate retrospectively.

The freshness-check itself is non-mutating (a single HTTP GET).
Its cost is negligible vs. the cost of acting on incomplete
state. **Skipping it where mandated is not an option** — the
cadence-driven check (per the cadence rule above), the
on-suspicion check, and the pre-mutation check are all
required; only the every-tick interpretation is over-specified
per Aaron's calibration.

## The assumption this rule makes testable

Aaron's framing names what was previously implicit: *"all our
assumptions are based on them being healthy today which is not
always true as we can see todya."* Every gate-state poll, every
auto-merge decision, every CI summary, every thread query
silently presumes GitHub is healthy. When the assumption is
true, polling is redundant; when the assumption is false, the
gate-state results lie. The freshness-check makes the
underlying assumption explicit and testable on every tick — it
costs almost nothing to verify and converts a silent failure
mode into a visible one.

## Re-arm condition during incident recovery

When auto-merge has been deliberately disabled because of a
live incident, re-arming requires **two consecutive consistent
freshness checks** (per the "Auto-merge re-arm during
dependency-incident recovery" section in the poll-the-gate
rule landing in PR #911 alongside this reference at
`memory/feedback_amara_poll_gate_not_ending_holding_is_not_status_2026_04_30.md`;
the cross-reference resolves once both PRs merge). One
freshness check during recovery jitter is not enough —
recovery may produce intermittent operational readings before
the underlying state actually clears.

## Composes with

- `docs/backlog/P0/B-0109-dependency-status-tracking-surface-2026-04-30.md`
  — the broader dependency-status tracking surface this
  reference is the first concrete piece of. Other dependencies
  (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google) get their own reference entries
  when their status sources are wired in; the design pass for
  the full surface lives in B-0109.
- `memory/feedback_amara_poll_gate_not_ending_holding_is_not_status_2026_04_30.md`
  (landing in PR #911 alongside this reference) — the
  poll-the-gate rule that names the gate-state shape and
  the auto-merge pre-flight check. The freshness-check rule
  here is the dependency-layer version of poll-the-gate.
- `docs/AUTONOMOUS-LOOP.md` — the loop discipline. The
  freshness-check above adds a dependency-aware pre-flight to
  the existing tick checklist; binding integration into the
  loop spec is a follow-up edit.
- The visibility-constraint rule (Aaron 2026-04-28; canonical
  home is `memory/CURRENT-aaron.md`'s "Visibility constraint"
  section, since the dedicated `feedback_*.md` file referenced
  by some MEMORY.md index entries was never landed in-repo).
  A degraded GitHub also degrades the visibility surface Aaron
  uses to verify factory state; freshness-check failures are
  a visibility gap that should be flagged in the lane-state
  report.

## Origin

Aaron 2026-04-30 sent two short, separated inputs that
together established this rule:

1. *"looking at github status should be first class for us we
   live on git and github for now until we get a 2nd host in
   the future"* — first-class framing.
2. *"that github status page should be first class remembered
   somwehre in our repo and loop since github is our only host
   right now"* — explicit ask to land it as durable
   substrate (in-repo memory + loop integration).

The catalyst was the live GitHub Pull Requests degradation
incident discovered earlier in the same session, ongoing since
2026-04-30T03:49Z, which directly exposed the gap this rule
fills.
