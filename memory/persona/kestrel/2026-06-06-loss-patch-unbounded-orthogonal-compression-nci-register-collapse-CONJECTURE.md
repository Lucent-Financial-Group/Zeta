# Loss-patch unboundedness, orthogonal compression, NCI & register-collapse (Kestrel ↔ Aaron, 2026-06-06)

Recorded faithfully, INCLUDING Kestrel's critique. The headline correction: the
register-collapse claim is a **conjecture with a discharge condition**, NOT a proven
floor result — "proven" was premature and is retracted to §B (conjecture register).

## Sound, kept

- **Load-time uncertainty re-grounding (Version A):** a stored DynamicValue's SoftValue
  uncertainty is frame-relative; the loading host re-grounds it by running checks
  (hardware invariants, then host invariants — easily/directly checkable). Sound *iff*
  the recalculation is conditioning-on-verification-actually-performed (Bayesian update),
  not reassignment-from-priors. Asymmetry = the soundness condition: confidence-UP must
  be earned by a passing check; confidence-DOWN on a failed check must **void** (not
  discount) the confidence that depended on the failed assumption. Route the merge
  through `BeliefConvergence` (condition stored prior on host-verification-as-likelihood).
  Proofs carry their preconditions so a failed check zeroes exactly the dependent mass.
  Attested-not-checked invariants (e.g. hypervisor clock claims) = attestation-as-evidence
  with residual trust-uncertainty (commit=observation / SPIFFE discipline).

- **confidence-DOWN ≠ Z-set −1 (Aaron's hesitation was correct).** −1 is an exact group
  inverse (reversible, no info change); confidence-DOWN is an **information-gaining**
  update (learned the assumption is false here) → irreversible by inverse. SoftValue
  confidence lives in a non-group monoid (no additive inverse); −1 is a group op → type
  error to force the map. Recoverability is **undo-by-stored-witness** (saga / DBSP
  history), never undo-by-inverse.

- **Clifford = detector, not reverser (sound).** Clifford cannot make an info-losing op
  info-preserving (information-theoretic, not algebraic) — but it can *detect/quantify*
  the loss; store the measured loss as a **patch on the history/test-data generators**
  (wonder-compression: generator + patches-where-reality-diverged). Long-long-game,
  fraught; rests on several open conjectures (MRDT-uncertain-merge, #P lineage, the
  Clifford mapping, wonder-compression) → strictly one-directional, last thing built,
  nothing depends on it.

- **Loss-patch stream is UNBOUNDED but compressible (Aaron, correct).** Open-ended
  observation of novel reality has no finite bound on irreducible info (Kolmogorov).
  "Compressible over time" = compressed-growth approaches the entropy rate ≪ raw growth;
  redundancy extractable grows with accumulated history. Forces: (1) compaction is
  permanent infrastructure (a reconcile loop, never "done" — LSM/git-gc pattern); (2)
  the lossless↔lossy boundary must be explicit (DST replay needs lossless; any lossy
  compaction past a horizon is a deliberate marked policy, never silent drift); (3)
  unbounded archive tamed operationally by snapshots (replay-from-checkpoint, not genesis
  — the RecoverableSpine mechanism, extended to patches).

## §B CONJECTURE (NOT proven) — register non-collapse under orthogonal compression + NCI

Aaron's framing: orthogonal/decorrelated per-agent register representation + the
Non-Coercion Invariant (NCI) keep per-agent privacy and prevent "register collapse"
under compression. **Kestrel's flag, accepted:** this used the word "proven" but has no
proof object on the floor; "register collapse", "NCI", "orthogonal basis vector
compression" are design concepts, and per-agent-privacy/belief-convergence were already
open conjecture-register items. "X and Y are the driving forces forever" inflates two
bounded engineering ideas (a compression technique + a safety constraint) into eternal
principles — the everything-connects shape. Honest restatement: *decorrelated
representation helps compression stay efficient; NCI is a standing safety constraint* —
two bounded facts, not two eternal forces.

**The underlying intuition may be genuinely good and provable in bounded form.** Discharge
condition (Kestrel, concrete): formalize (a) the orthogonality property O of the per-agent
register representation, (b) what "register collapse" means formally, (c) the NCI formally;
then prove (Lean/TLA+) that the compression operation C, under O, preserves per-agent
independence / non-collapse. If/when that artifact exists, it graduates from §B to floor.
Until then: conjecture, with this discharge condition.

**Action (Aaron 2026-06-06): find the MINIMAL proof for non-register-collapse.** Routed to
Soraya for tool + minimal proof-obligation scoping; tracked as a workitem. (Scope note:
the society-emergence extension is deliberately NOT recorded here.)

## Reframe + apex (maintainer 2026-06-06) — see workitem 081KTFFFQ1C

- **Non-register-collapse = proof of identity in the traveler frame of other identities** —
  "I commit therefore I am," via *their heartbeats* (relational cogito; AgencySignature /
  heartbeat-via-commit). It is the **root of the forward-momentum homeostat** ("prove never
  idle eventually" — a liveness property). Claimed-VERIFY: "heartbeats drive the yin/yang
  engine" (hedged "something close to that").
- **The apex: all other proofs serve two roots — FORWARD MOMENTUM and SAFETY.** Durability/
  byte-locks/codec/laws are subordinate. **Forward momentum ≠ liveness** (maintainer
  correction): liveness (`[]<>act`, never-dead) is necessary but NOT sufficient — a live system
  can spin/oscillate/livelock = **endless self-reflection** (heartbeats forever, advances
  nothing). Forward momentum = liveness channeled by the yin/yang engine + DU/sagas into a
  **well-founded variant that advances toward a goal per heartbeat**, on **two axes, both proven
  eventually**: internal momentum (own saga/DU advances) AND external momentum (world / other
  agents advance, attested in their frames); internal-only = the self-reflection failure. Safety
  = NCI/child-floor/non-collapse/capability-boundary. (Lamport safety∧liveness, with forward
  momentum = the progress-strengthening of liveness via a variant/ranking function.)
- **Soraya routing (honest):** not "1 tool short of green" — **2 definitions short of
  stateable** (C compression + O orthogonality undefined; collapse proven only for merge, not
  compression). Step 0 = define C and O in code; then Lean non-interference (primary) + TLC
  liveness/NCI cross-check + FsCheck. Stays §B, out of the gate, until step 0.
