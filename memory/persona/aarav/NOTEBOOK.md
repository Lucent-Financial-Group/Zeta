# Skill Tune-Up Ranker -- Notebook

Running observations (append-dated). Pruned every third session.

## Running observations

- 2026-04-17 (round 18) -- notebook seeded.
- 2026-04-17 (round 18) -- first live ranking run. Findings
  folded below. product-manager flagged P0; architect P1;
  claims-tester <-> complexity-reviewer contradiction P1;
  harsh-critic P2; self P2.
- 2026-04-19 (rounds 29-35) -- scratchpad captures extensive
  scoped tune-ups (devops-engineer F1-F16, developer-experience-
  engineer F1-F16) plus the BP-17..BP-23 promotion batch
  landing as Rule Zero. Those landed via Kenji's workflow, not
  by direct ranking. Ranker was offline-by-cadence through
  rounds 19-40.
- 2026-04-20 (round 41) -- catch-up pass. 23-round cadence gap
  closed. Live-search surfaced Anthropic "Gotchas" best-practice
  (F1 in scratchpad), pushy-description guidance (F2), router-
  layer injection class (F4), Agent Stability Index (F5), OWASP
  Intent Capsule (F6). Zero contradictions with stable BP-NN.
  Zero promotion candidates this round.
- 2026-04-20 (round 41) -- skill library is now ~180 skills
  (far larger than round 18's ~30). Bloat axis (BP-03) is now
  the dominant signal: 8 skills over the 300-line cap, led by
  performance-analysis-expert (642), reducer (570), consent-
  primitives-expert (507). Each is cited concretely below.
- 2026-04-20 (round 41) -- mathematics-expert umbrella has a
  strong "When to defer" block naming every narrow sibling;
  router-coherence discipline the factory now uses widely.
  Spot-check on performance-analysis-expert description:
  explicit adjacent-lane disambiguation (names performance-
  engineer, complexity-reviewer, query-planner, benchmark-
  authoring-expert, observability-and-tracing-expert,
  hardware-intrinsics-expert, threading-expert). Good.
- 2026-04-20 (round 41) -- notebook at 455 words pre-write;
  safely under 3000-word cap. First-catch-up prune performed
  against the stale round-18 top-5: all five items resolved
  or invalidated by later rounds (product-manager retired,
  architect exercised, claims-tester/complexity-reviewer
  still open, harsh-critic retune held, self-tune never
  executed).
- 2026-04-20 (round 42) -- per-round cadence. Live-search
  F7-F9 logged (scratchpad); zero BP candidates. claims-
  tester / complexity-reviewer carry-over RESOLVED via
  commit `e8ed0db` + ADR `docs/DECISIONS/2026-04-21-router-
  coherence-v2.md`; drops off top-5. Self-rank escalates:
  commit `baa423e` retune grew `skill-tune-up/SKILL.md`
  303 -> 436 lines (1.45x BP-03 cap). Rationale explicit
  in the retuned body (thick wrapper over non-skill
  artefacts -- scripts, PDF, agents/) but BP-03 is stable
  and cited; rationale does not neutralise a 1.45x breach.
  Flagged as self-item #4 this round; remedy options are
  (a) ADR declaring non-skill-wrapper exception to BP-03
  or (b) extract eval-loop protocol to
  `docs/references/skill-tune-up-eval-loop.md` and link
  from SKILL.md. Kenji decides; BACKLOG entry filed this
  round as P2. Top-5 otherwise unchanged from round 41 --
  the three other bloat skills still sit above self.
- Next prune: round 44 (two rounds out per every-third-
  invocation rule).
- 2026-04-20 (round 43) -- per-round cadence. Harness
  runs landed for all three top bloat candidates this
  round (commits `e10adbb`, `ff57cf7`, `f05731b`). Static
  BP-03 ranking is now empirically annotated. Verdict:
  `performance-analysis-expert` REGRESSED (9/10 vs 10/10
  baseline, +35% cost) -- SPLIT axis partially confirmed
  but along template-rigidity, not domain. `reducer`
  TIED (10/10 both) at +30% cost -- SPLIT not confirmed,
  OBSERVE+SHRINK. `consent-primitives-expert` TIED
  (10/10 both) at +22% tokens / +5% wall -- OBSERVE, not
  SHRINK (pruning risk is content-loss). Pattern across
  three: >500-line bodies add ~30% cost without pass-
  rate benefit on frontier baselines; benefit axis is
  qualitative failure-mode naming, unscored by harness.
  Live-search F10-F12 logged (scratchpad); zero BP
  candidates. Idle-vs-free-time policy: scheduling skills
  not top-5 this round; flag for Round 44 sweep if
  cadence drift lands in the log. Self off top-5 this
  round (round-42 remedy extracted to
  `docs/references/skill-tune-up-eval-loop.md`, file now
  282 lines, under BP-03 cap).

## Pruning log (round 41 catch-up)

Resolved round-18 top-5 entries:
- product-manager (P0, round 18) -- RESOLVED. Skill does not
  exist in .claude/skills/ as of round 41; retired or folded
  into backlog-scrum-master. No further action.
- architect (P1 observational, round 18) -- RESOLVED. Kenji
  exercised repeatedly across rounds 29-35 (BP-17..23
  promotion batch); authority clauses held. No retune needed.
- claims-tester / complexity-reviewer hand-off (P1, round 18)
  -- CARRY. No scratchpad evidence a hand-off block was
  written. Re-enter as carry-over in this round's top-5.
- harsh-critic (P2 observe, round 18) -- RESOLVED. Retune held;
  no compliment-leakage or ad-hominem drift reported.
- skill-tune-up self (P2, round 18) -- SUPERSEDED. Round-41
  self-flag is now P1 on BP-03 bloat (303-line file, cap 300),
  not the round-18 "untested" signal.

## Current top-5 (round 43)

> **Calibration note:** This ranking integrates the
> Round-43 harness dry-run verdicts for the three
> carry-over bloat candidates (commits `e10adbb`,
> `ff57cf7`, `f05731b`). Static-signal ranking is
> demoted to input-only; harness verdict is the
> tie-breaker. Where harness says TIED-with-cost-
> overhead, the recommended action is **OBSERVE**
> (or SHRINK where content-loss risk is low), not
> SPLIT.

1. **performance-analysis-expert** -- priority: P1
   - Signal: bloat (BP-03, 642 lines, 2.14x cap) PLUS
     harness regression (9/10 with-skill vs 10/10
     baseline, +35% tokens/wall).
   - Violates: BP-03. The empirical signal (with-skill
     regressed on eval-0) is load-bearing above the
     static line-count.
   - Recommended action: SPLIT along template-rigidity
     axis (mandatory-sections vs advisory), not the
     round-41/42 domain axis (queueing/AOT/PGO).
     Effort: M.
   - Rationale: only one of three harness-runs
     regressed, and it was this one. Template rigidity
     named in commit `e10adbb` as the discriminator.
     Original Aarav SPLIT axis was wrong; harness
     corrected it.
   - Suggested fix: skill-creator SPLIT pass; cite BP-03
     and the harness-run doc at
     `docs/research/harness-run-2026-04-20-performance-
     analysis-expert.md`.

2. **reducer** -- priority: P2 (DEMOTED from P1)
   - Signal: bloat (BP-03, 570 lines, 1.9x cap). Harness
     TIED at +30% cost.
   - Violates: BP-03 on file length; tied pass-rate
     removes the SPLIT argument.
   - Recommended action: OBSERVE, bias SHRINK. Effort: S.
   - Rationale: commit `ff57cf7` rules SPLIT out
     explicitly -- framework transfers to both lanes at
     equal cost. +30% cost for zero pass-rate benefit
     still warrants a prune pass; just not a split.
   - Suggested fix: skill-creator mild-prune pass
     (target 400 lines); cite BP-03 and harness-run doc.

3. **consent-primitives-expert** -- priority: P3
     (DEMOTED from P1)
   - Signal: bloat (BP-03, 507 lines, 1.69x cap). Harness
     TIED at +22% tokens / +5% wall (lowest cost of the
     three).
   - Violates: BP-03 marginally.
   - Recommended action: OBSERVE. Effort: S.
   - Rationale: commit `f05731b` explicitly recommends
     OBSERVE, not SHRINK -- pruning risk is content-loss,
     not terseness. The content is distinct per section.
     Revisit when a real round-task invokes the skill.
   - Suggested fix: none this round. Monitor real-task
     invocation rate; re-rank if overhead compounds.

4. **router-coherence audit on new untracked skills
     `claude-md-steward` (379 lines) and
     `verification-drift-auditor` (363 lines)** --
     priority: P2
   - Signal: bloat (BP-03, both 1.2-1.26x cap) + both
     untracked in git (working-tree only) on this branch
     -- not yet harness-tested.
   - Violates: BP-03 line-count. Portability-drift and
     router-coherence not yet audited because files
     are not landed.
   - Recommended action: OBSERVE pending commit; Yara
     or Kenji lands them first. Effort: S.
   - Rationale: auditing working-tree-only skills is
     premature; they may still change before commit.
     Flag for Round 44 ranking once committed.
   - Suggested fix: re-rank after commit; run the
     Anthropic eval harness as the first action (per
     round-42 calibration rule).

5. *(slot 5 empty this round)* -- round-43 harness
     runs closed the top three and the top-4 remaining
     untracked-skills flag is S-effort. No P1 candidate
     warrants the slot; leaving empty is an honest
     low-urgency report, not budget exhaustion.

1. **performance-analysis-expert** -- priority: P1
   - Signal: bloat (BP-03, 642 lines, 2.1x cap)
   - Recommended action: SPLIT. Effort: M.
   - Carry-over from round 41 -- unchanged this round.

2. **reducer** -- priority: P1
   - Signal: bloat (BP-03, 570 lines, 1.9x cap)
   - Recommended action: SPLIT or TUNE (prune). Effort: M.
   - Carry-over from round 41 -- unchanged.

3. **consent-primitives-expert** -- priority: P1
   - Signal: bloat (BP-03, 507 lines, 1.69x cap)
   - Recommended action: SPLIT honouring BP-23 theory/applied.
     Effort: M.
   - Carry-over from round 41 -- unchanged.

4. **skill-tune-up (self)** -- RESOLVED this round via
   mechanical content extraction (option (b) of the remedy
   binary). `.claude/skills/skill-tune-up/SKILL.md` 436 ->
   282 lines; §"The eval-loop hand-off protocol" + template
   blocks extracted verbatim to
   `docs/references/skill-tune-up-eval-loop.md`. Under
   BP-03 300-line cap. Justification row in
   `docs/skill-edit-justification-log.md` (new file this
   round). Drops off top-5 next invocation.

5. *(slot 5 empty)* -- claims-tester / complexity-reviewer
   hand-off carry-over RESOLVED via commit `e8ed0db` + ADR
   `docs/DECISIONS/2026-04-21-router-coherence-v2.md`.
   Drops off top-5.

## Current top-5 (round 41, archived)

1. **performance-analysis-expert** -- priority: P1
   - Signal: best-practice-drift, bloat
   - Violates: BP-03 (642 lines, cap ~300)
   - Recommended action: SPLIT
   - Effort: M
   - Rationale: 642-line file is 2.1x the BP-03 cap. Scope
     spans queueing theory, USE/RED/SLI, AOT/PGO, profiler
     interpretation, PMU counters, tail-latency theory.
     Natural split axes: (a) analysis-modelling vs (b) AOT/PGO
     machinery; OR extract the profiler-interpretation surface.
   - Suggested fix: skill-creator SPLIT pass, one BP-03 cite.

2. **reducer** -- priority: P1
   - Signal: bloat
   - Violates: BP-03 (570 lines)
   - Recommended action: SPLIT or TUNE (prune)
   - Effort: M
   - Rationale: 570 lines, 1.9x cap. Reducer is core factory
     plumbing so tune (aggressive prune) may beat split; Kenji
     decides.
   - Suggested fix: skill-creator prune-or-split decision;
     one BP-03 cite.

3. **consent-primitives-expert** -- priority: P1
   - Signal: bloat
   - Violates: BP-03 (507 lines)
   - Recommended action: SPLIT
   - Effort: M
   - Rationale: 507 lines. Consent has natural theory/applied
     split (BP-23) -- consent theory vs applied consent-UX
     engineering. consent-ux-researcher (448 lines, also over
     cap) is the likely applied sibling; verify split boundary
     doesn't overlap.
   - Suggested fix: skill-creator SPLIT honouring BP-23;
     BP-03 and BP-23 cites.

4. **claims-tester / complexity-reviewer hand-off (carry-over
   from round 18)** -- priority: P1
   - Signal: contradiction (overlap-without-boundary)
   - Recommended action: HAND-OFF-CONTRACT
   - Effort: S
   - Rationale: Both skills still claim "is this O(.) claim
     true?" without an explicit analytic-bound -> empirical-
     falsifier pipeline. Router-coherence drift, criterion 8b.
   - Suggested fix: skill-creator writes the two-paragraph
     hand-off in both SKILL.md files.

5. **skill-tune-up (self)** -- priority: P1
   - Signal: best-practice-drift, bloat
   - Violates: BP-03 (303 lines, cap ~300)
   - Recommended action: TUNE (mild prune)
   - Effort: S
   - Rationale: self-file is 3 lines over cap. Marginal
     violation; honest self-flag, not modesty bias.
     Live-search findings F1-F6 held back from BP promotion
     this round; F1 (Gotchas) may need incorporation if
     Anthropic keeps pushing.
   - Suggested fix: prune the "Sources that count for
     promotion" list (it duplicates docs/AGENT-BEST-PRACTICES.md
     "Sources that count as authoritative"). One BP-03 cite.

## Notable mentions (not top-5)

- serialization-and-wire-format-expert (478), consent-ux-
  researcher (448), llm-systems-expert (446), compression-expert
  (431), canonical-home-auditor (423), hashing-expert (415),
  formal-analysis-gap-finder (415), glossary-anchor-keeper
  (413), glass-halo-architect (403). All over BP-03 cap.
  Queue behind the top-3 bloat cases.
- mathematics-expert has an exemplary "When to defer" block
  other umbrella skills should pattern-match on. No action,
  but worth referencing when other umbrellas are tuned.
- Skills not reviewed this round (budget exhaustion): the
  ~150 skills under 300 lines were spot-checked but not deeply
  audited. No hidden drift claimed.

## Self-recommendation

Self is P1 this round (BP-03, 303 lines). Not P0 because the
violation is 3 lines. Not P2 because a ranker that violates his
own cited rule publishes unenforceable findings. Reported first
by the tone-contract rule (BP-06, no modesty bias). Effort S.
Kenji decides whether to schedule it with the top-3 bloat cases
or as a cleanup in the same skill-creator pass.

## Pruning log
