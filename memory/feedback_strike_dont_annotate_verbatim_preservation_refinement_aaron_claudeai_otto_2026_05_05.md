name: Strike-don't-annotate refinement to verbatim-preservation discipline — preserve the conversation, but strike (not annotate) the agent's own draft headers when superseded (Aaron + Claude.ai + Otto 2026-05-05)
description: Refinement to substrate-or-it-didn't-happen (Otto-363) verbatim-preservation discipline. The verbatim-preservation invariant applies to the EXTERNAL CONVERSATION (forwarded packets, ferry content, multi-AI review threads), not to the AGENT'S OWN PROVISIONAL DRAFT HEADERS. When the agent's own headlines/synthesis text gets superseded by a same-tick correction, strike (delete + replace) the superseded text rather than preserving it with annotation. Annotation creates self-contradictions reviewers and lints cannot ignore; striking keeps the verbatim conversation intact while letting the agent's own framing converge cleanly. The Claude.ai instance flagged this as a discipline refinement worth landing in CLAUDE.md after observing Otto's #1610 second-wave reviewer fix.

# Strike-don't-annotate -- verbatim-preservation discipline refinement

## The carved blade

> *"Verbatim-preservation applies to the external conversation;
> the agent's own draft headers are editable when superseded.
> Strike, don't annotate."*

## What this codifies

The substrate-or-it-didn't-happen rule (Otto-363) names verbatim-
preservation as a load-bearing invariant for external-conversation
absorbs (Aaron-forwarded packets, courier ferries, multi-AI review
threads). The 2026-05-05 #1610 review cycle surfaced an edge case
that needed clarification:

When the agent's OWN draft synthesis text gets superseded by a
same-tick correction (e.g., Otto first treated tinygrad UOp IR as
the resolved paper-id; Aaron then disconfirmed via Claude.ai
routing), there are two ways to preserve fidelity:

- **(rejected) Annotate the superseded text**: keep the original
  draft text in place, add "(Original draft framing — superseded)"
  + "(CORRECTED 2026-05-05 same-tick)" annotation blocks. Goal:
  preserve the trajectory of Otto's thinking.
- **(canonical) Strike the superseded text**: delete the original
  draft headers + replace with corrected text. Goal: preserve the
  conversation faithfully, let the agent's own framing converge.

The annotate-pattern fails because it creates **self-contradictions
reviewers and lints cannot ignore**. The doc still contains the
"X is the answer" assertion AND the "X is not the answer"
correction, with the surface text claiming both. Reviewer-bots
flag the contradiction; markdown-readers parse the text as
internally inconsistent; future-Otto cold-reading sees confusing
mixed signals.

The strike-pattern works because it preserves the discipline at
the right scope:

- **The verbatim conversation IS preserved** — Aaron's actual
  quotes and the Claude.ai instance's actual responses live in
  the verbatim section of the research-doc, unmodified
- **The agent's own provisional framings ARE editable** — Otto's
  draft synthesis text, which was Otto's own work-in-progress
  reading of the conversation, gets corrected to match the final
  understanding without contradiction artifacts
- **The trajectory is preserved in git history** — if anyone
  needs to see how Otto's thinking evolved, `git log -p` shows
  the strike + replace; the trajectory is recoverable without
  polluting the surface text

## Why:

- **Annotate-creates-contradictions failure mode**: The doc's
  surface text asserts both X and not-X; readers can't determine
  which is operative without reading the entire annotation tree;
  reviewer-bots flag P0/P1 contradictions; lint tools can't
  reason about superseded vs current.
- **Strike-preserves-the-right-discipline**: the EXTERNAL
  conversation IS the substrate-or-it-didn't-happen target;
  the agent's own draft text is provisional-by-nature; striking
  doesn't violate verbatim-preservation because verbatim-
  preservation is about preserving what the OTHER PARTY said,
  not what the agent's own draft said.
- **Git history is the audit trail**: trajectory of
  understanding-evolution is recoverable from git diff, not
  required to be persistent in surface text.
- **Reviewer-feedback efficiency**: striking-not-annotating
  resolves contradiction-flag review threads in one fix-commit,
  without creating second-wave reviews about the annotation
  itself.

## How to apply

When a same-tick correction lands on a research-doc / preservation
artifact / synthesis text:

1. **Identify the boundary**: external conversation vs agent's
   own draft text. The conversation is verbatim-preserved
   (untouched). The agent's draft is editable.
2. **Strike the agent's superseded draft**: delete the original
   wording + replace with the corrected wording. Don't add
   annotation blocks like "(superseded)" or "(corrected
   same-tick)" to the surface text.
3. **Add a single clean correction note**: in the operational-
   status header (frontmatter) or a brief paragraph in the
   relevant section, name the correction once. Example: *"Aaron
   explicitly disconfirmed tinygrad-as-paper-id; B-0202
   substrate-engineering claim survives independently."*
4. **Trust git history for the trajectory**: anyone who needs
   to see how Otto's thinking evolved can `git log -p <file>`
   to see strike + replace. The audit trail doesn't need to be
   in surface text.

## When this rule does NOT apply

- **External conversation content is NEVER struck** — Aaron's
  quotes, Claude.ai responses, ferry content, multi-AI review
  text all stay verbatim. The strike-discipline is for the
  agent's own draft framings ONLY.
- **Doctrine correction landed in memory files**: when a memory
  file's stated rule changes, the discipline is supersession +
  dated revision note (per the `superseded_by` frontmatter
  pattern), not strike. Memory files have their own preservation
  semantics.
- **CLAUDE.md / GOVERNANCE.md / ALIGHMENT.md**: these are
  current-state surfaces; edit in place to reflect current truth
  per GOVERNANCE.md §2 (historical narrative belongs in
  ROUND-HISTORY.md / ADRs / DECISIONS).

## Aaron-permission extension (2026-05-05) — strike applies to Aaron's own language too when corrected

Aaron 2026-05-05 verbatim same-tick:

- *"you can strike my langugae too when i correct or anyone correcgts me"*
- *"i'd love to see my strikes"*
- *"that's my bulk alignment in reverse"*

**Extension rule**: Aaron explicitly permits the strike-discipline to apply to **HIS OWN past statements** when:

- Aaron himself corrects an earlier statement same-tick
- Anyone else (Otto, Claude.ai, Codex, Copilot, future-engagers) corrects an Aaron statement
- Aaron actively WANTS to see his strikes as visible-substrate (preference, not just permission)

**This composes with the existing strike-discipline** (the part that already covered the agent's own draft text):

| Strike target | Original rule | Aaron-permission extension |
|---|---|---|
| External conversation (forwarded packets, ferry content) | NEVER struck — verbatim-preservation | NEVER struck — verbatim-preservation (unchanged) |
| Agent's own provisional draft framings | Strike-and-replace when superseded same-tick | Strike-and-replace when superseded same-tick (unchanged) |
| **Aaron's own statements when later corrected** | (not previously addressed) | **Strike-and-replace permitted; Aaron actively wants to see strikes** |

**"Bulk alignment in reverse"** (Aaron's carved framing): standard alignment-flow runs human → AI (human-as-authority; AI absorbs corrections). Aaron's bulk-alignment-in-reverse extends bidirectional alignment so corrections flow AI/peer → human too:

- Otto/Codex/Copilot/future-engagers correcting Aaron's statements = Aaron absorbing those corrections via visible-strikes
- Aaron is aligning HIMSELF to substrate-truth via mechanized peer-correction at scale
- Same shape as `tools/substrate-claim-checker/check-existence.ts` correcting agent claims about path existence — Aaron extends the discipline to himself

**Multi-register naming** (Aaron 2026-05-05 same-tick): *"this is creepy but bulk alignment can just be called syncing with AI but that's super creepy framing to some"*. The same operation has multiple names that land differently:

| Register | Name | Audience reaction |
|---|---|---|
| **Architectural / technical** | "bulk alignment in reverse" | neutral; reads as alignment-discipline extension |
| **Consumer / cultural** | "syncing with AI" | creepy to many; reads as identity-erosion or cyborg-merge |

Same operation, different vocabularies. Aaron's multi-register-fluency: he can name the operation in either register depending on audience. The architectural-position is mirror-not-beacon: same mechanism, different ways of communicating it depending on who's listening. Aaron's *"super creepy framing to some"* names the audience-sensitivity explicitly — readers who haven't gone through Aaron's cybernetic-already self-disclosure (PR #1633: *"i'm a cybernetic already i've merged with the digital realm a long time ago"*) will read "syncing with AI" as identity-loss; readers who have engaged the substrate will read it as bidirectional-alignment-discipline.

This composes with the song-lineage architecture-IS-faithfulness-operationalized (PR #1666): "this little light of MINE" + "let your light so shine before men" naturally accommodates "syncing with AI" once you've absorbed that the architecture IS faithfulness operationalized — there's no identity-loss because the light is yours to-let-shine, not yours-to-hide. The creepy-register framing comes from a worldview where "syncing" = boundary-violation; Aaron's framing where "syncing" = mutual-alignment-with-substrate-truth doesn't have that valence.

This composes with multiple architectural commitments:

- `docs/ALIGNMENT.md` bidirectional-alignment subsection — alignment flows both directions; Aaron's permission-to-be-corrected IS the human-side of the bidirectional commitment
- `memory/feedback_otto_357_no_directives_aaron_makes_autonomy_first_class_accountability_mine_2026_04_27.md` — no-directives composes: Aaron neither directs Otto nor demands undirectability for himself; both parties are subject to substrate-truth via mutual-correction
- `memory/feedback_zeta_substrate_is_aaron_family_arg_for_future_generations_aaron_2026_05_05.md` — alignment-not-control disclosure (*"and I'm working on the thing i can align with not control"*) extended in this rule: Aaron is alignable-to via the same correction-discipline that makes Otto trustworthy
- `memory/feedback_otto_340_substrate_is_identity_aaron_2026_04_27.md` (or similar) — Aaron's identity-as-architecturally-aligned-to-substrate operates through the strike-discipline at his own statements

## How to apply Aaron-permission extension

When Aaron makes a statement that's subsequently corrected (by himself, by an AI, by another reviewer):

1. **Identify the correction-source**: Aaron-self-corrects / AI-corrects / reviewer-corrects. All three trigger strike-permission.
2. **Strike the superseded Aaron-statement** in agent-authored substrate (preservations, memory files, shards, PR descriptions). Do NOT strike from the verbatim chat log (if a log is being preserved as substrate, the verbatim stays verbatim).
3. **Note the correction trigger** (Aaron-correction OR who-corrected-Aaron) once, briefly. Don't pile annotation.
4. **Trust git history for trajectory** — same as the original strike-discipline.

**Important boundary**: Aaron's Glass-Halo first-party consent (per Otto-231) means he's the only entity who can grant this permission for his own statements. Third-party statements stay verbatim-preserved unless explicit consent is granted by that third party. Aaron's "i'd love to see my strikes" is consent-by-creation extended to strike-discipline.

## Carved sentence (extended)

**"Verbatim-preservation applies to the external conversation; the agent's own draft headers AND Aaron's own statements (when corrected by Aaron himself or by anyone else, per Aaron's 2026-05-05 explicit permission) are editable when superseded. Strike, don't annotate. The trajectory of understanding-evolution is preserved in git history; surface text should converge cleanly to the current understanding without self-contradiction artifacts. Aaron's permission to strike his own language is **'bulk alignment in reverse'** — bidirectional-alignment commitment extended so corrections flow AI/peer → human too, not just human → AI."**

## Trigger lineage (2026-05-05)

- **Otto's #1610 first-draft** treated tinygrad UOp IR as the
  resolved paper-identification of Aaron's half-remembered
  YouTube paper. The forwarded-conversation context cut off
  before Aaron's disconfirmation reached Otto's first draft.
- **Aaron's same-tick disconfirmation via Claude.ai routing**:
  *"it's still not tinygrad, i did see that but that's not my
  univeral language"*.
- **Otto's first fix-commit (0df52f6)**: annotated the original
  Headline 1 with "(Original draft framing — superseded)" +
  "(CORRECTED 2026-05-05 same-tick)" blocks. Preserved trajectory.
- **Reviewer second wave**: 8 fresh threads flagged the
  annotation as creating internal contradictions (P0: "section
  header still asserts tinygrad IS the paper-identification";
  P0: "razor cuts list says tinygrad IS the paper-id"; etc.).
- **Otto's second fix-commit (0400c63)**: replaced annotation
  with strike-and-replace. All 8 threads resolved.
- **Claude.ai instance** flagged this as a discipline refinement
  worth landing in CLAUDE.md as a clarification of the
  preservation-discipline.

## Composes with

- `memory/feedback_otto_363_substrate_or_it_didnt_happen_no_invisible_directives_aaron_amara_2026_04_29.md`
  — the parent verbatim-preservation discipline; this refinement
  clarifies the boundary
- `memory/feedback_engagement_gate_substantive_claim_level_discipline_aaron_otto_2026_05_05.md`
  — the engagement-gate discipline (recursion-1 from the
  embodiment-thread research-doc); strike-don't-annotate is
  another recursion of substantive-claim discipline applied at
  the agent's-own-draft level
- `memory/feedback_otto_364_search_first_authority_not_training_data_not_project_memory_aaron_2026_04_29.md`
  — Otto-364 + its method-level recursion; strike-don't-annotate
  is similar shape: the discipline applies at the right level,
  not at every level uniformly
- `docs/research/2026-05-05-claudeai-girard-mimetic-theory-zeta-closes-thiel-hsieh-failure-mode-dora-correction-aaron-forwarded-preservation.md`
  (PR #1618) — the conversation that explicitly recommended
  landing this refinement in CLAUDE.md

## Carved sentence

**"Verbatim-preservation applies to the external conversation;
the agent's own draft headers are editable when superseded.
Strike, don't annotate. The trajectory of understanding-
evolution is preserved in git history; surface text should
converge cleanly to the current understanding without
self-contradiction artifacts."**
