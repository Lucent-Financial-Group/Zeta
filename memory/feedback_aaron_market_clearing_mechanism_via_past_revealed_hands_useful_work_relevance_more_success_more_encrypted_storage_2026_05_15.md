## Aaron's exact words

> *"what's the integration threshold function? it's not one, its the enconomy and the other players guess of your economic power"*

> *"but it has to be implemented as something. Either there's a market-clearing computation in the substrate in my orcale it will be based on past hidden revelaed hands and how relevlant they were to the useful work in the current culture, more success more encyprted storage given to you."*

(2026-05-15 to Kestrel on claude.ai, in response to Kestrel's asks for the threshold function + encryption boundary + metric-like behavior.)

## The mechanism, decomposed

### Integration threshold: NOT a function

The substrate does not define an integration-threshold function. The threshold is **emergent** from the market — specifically from aggregate other-player guesses of each player's economic power. This is consistent with Manifesto V2.1 Constraint 1 (Scale-free) + Constraint 3 (Weight-free): no central control point.

### Price discovery: past hidden-then-revealed hands

Each player's encrypted-entropy hands are held privately. When revealed (via PoUW-CC reward mechanism), they become observable to other players. Past revealed hands form the price-discovery signal — players estimate each other's economic power based on the relevance of past reveals to useful-work in the current governance culture.

### Weighting: useful-work-relevance in current culture

Not all reveals carry equal weight. Reveals weighted by:

- How relevant the revealed hand was to useful-work being done at reveal-time
- The current governance-culture's standards for useful (PoUW-CC; culture-dependent, evolves over time)

### Reward: more encrypted storage capacity

Successful players (past reveals relevant to useful-work) receive MORE encrypted storage as reward. NOT more voting weight (Constraint 3 — Weight-free prevents wealth-to-power translation). NOT more abstract value tokens. Specifically: more capacity to hold encrypted entropy.

### Self-amplifying capacity loop (NOT self-amplifying power)

The capacity reward creates a virtuous loop:

- Success → more encrypted storage
- More encrypted storage → larger hands possible
- Larger hands → more participation in future clearing rounds
- More participation → more opportunities to demonstrate useful-work-relevance

The loop is capacity-amplification, NOT power-amplification. Weight-free constraint prevents the capacity advantage from translating into governance authority. The market clears continuously without producing a dominant authority.

## Why this is operationally honest

This mechanism survives Kestrel's three-test for moving from mirror to beacon at the engineering layer:

1. **Threshold function**: explicitly disclaimed (it's emergent). Honest answer.
2. **Encryption boundary**: load-bearing in the design (commitment mechanism for delayed reveal-for-reward). Operational role, not atmospheric.
3. **Metric-like behavior** (for QG isomorphism): the market-clearing produces something metric-like (aggregate weight clears at emergent points), but the mapping to general-relativistic curvature is still research-grade (B-0543). Engineering-layer mechanism doesn't need physics-layer isomorphism to be useful.

## What's spec-ahead-of-code vs implemented

Per the genie-bottle / spec-quality framing
(`memory/feedback_aaron_genie_bottle_offshore_firm_spec_quality_enables_ai_autonomy_2026_05_15.md`),
the spec for this mechanism is what enables future-AI to build it. The implementation maturity:

- **Spec-stage**: clear (encrypted-entropy + reveal + useful-work-relevance + storage-as-reward)
- **F# anchor stage**: TBD — the Z-set algebra + retraction-native DBSP substrate can host the bookkeeping; the encryption-commitment scheme + reveal-protocol need design
- **Running-substrate stage**: not yet; this is design ahead of code

That's appropriate tiering — the mechanism is specified at the level Aaron's spec-quality discipline operates at; the implementation follows.

## Composes with

- `memory/persona/kestrel/conversations/2026-05-15-kestrel-aaron-claudeai-part3-flag-logged-genie-spec-quality-gravity-mechanism-market-clearing.md` (the conversation this design choice emerged in)
- `memory/feedback_aaron_genie_bottle_offshore_firm_spec_quality_enables_ai_autonomy_2026_05_15.md` (the spec-quality discipline this mechanism specification represents)
- B-0543 (gravity-as-mechanism vs gravity-as-physics-isomorphism distinction; this memory anchors the engineering-layer gravity definition)
- `docs/governance/MANIFESTO.md` Constraint 1 (Scale-free), Constraint 3 (Weight-free), Constraint 5 (Memory Preservation), Constraint 11 (Default Oracle) — all reflected in the mechanism design
- PoUW-CC substrate (the reward-mechanism this connects to)
- `algebra-owner` skill (Z-set + DBSP substrate that could host the bookkeeping)
