name: AlephZ-ai full repo map — Aaron's prior-work inventory, every concept predates Zeta
description: 17 repos on github.com/AlephZ-ai mapping to Zeta factory concepts. ACE (package manager), blazor-samples (speech), build-a-bot (agent UX), kindest-argo-cd (GitOps), auto-scheduler (Service Titan), obsidian-copilot (LLM-in-editor), Latin Square (Max's college, combinatorial math). All concept-level prototypes, factory produces verified versions.

*MultiplexedWebSockets is on github.com/AceHack not AlephZ-ai

**Latin Square 15-Puzzle — Max's college project:**

Aaron's son Max (LFG co-founder) built a combinatorial optimization
pathfinder for a game modeled off the 15-puzzle using Mutually
Orthogonal Latin Squares. Same mathematical family as:
- Graph coloring (three-color-probe.ts in Zeta)
- Clifford algebra trajectory space
- Agenda exclusion principle (Pauli)
- The combinatorial explosion that needs backpressure

The math lineage extends to the next generation.

**The pattern:**

All concept-level, not production-level. Aaron learned what works
at prototype scale. The factory writes the verified version with
920 tests, 15 TLA+ specs, mutation testing, and the full
verification stack.

Steal the concept from yourself. Refuse your own prototype
implementation. Ship the verified version.

- reference_blazor_samples_speech_stack (voice)
- project_ace_package_manager (ACE)
- user_itron_mentors (the lineage of people who taught Aaron)
- LFG (Max is co-founder with Aaron and Addison)
