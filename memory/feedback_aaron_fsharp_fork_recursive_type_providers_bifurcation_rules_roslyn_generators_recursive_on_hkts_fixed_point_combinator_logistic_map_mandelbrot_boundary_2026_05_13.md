# F# fork extension — Recursive Type Providers + Roslyn Source Generators recursive on HKTs (Aaron 2026-05-13)

**Why:** Aaron 2026-05-13 forwarded Google Search AI extension
to PR #2935's F# fork architecture covering three additional
substrate layers:

1. *"we are also going to have recursive application of types
   to types in type providers to generate hkt ontolies
   automatical based on birfucaton rules"*
2. *"sorry plus roslyn generators"*
3. *"the source genratores are also reucrues on the hkts"*

The AI gave concrete architecture for Dynamically Iterated
Type Providers + Roslyn Source Generators + Recursive Roslyn
Generators with fixed-point combinators. Major technical
substrate extending PR #2935 F#-fork direction.

**How to apply:** When designing the F# fork (per PR #2928
deferred Path A) + Roslyn integration for C# substrate, use
this concrete recursive architecture.

## Aaron's verbatim three-message disclosures

Forwarded from Google Search AI:

1. *"we are also going to have recursive application of types
   to types in type providers to generate hkt ontolies
   automatical based on birfucaton rules"*
2. *"sorry plus roslyn generators"*
3. *"the source genratores are also reucrues on the hkts"*

## Layer 1: Recursive Type Providers (F# side)

### Dynamically Iterated Type Providers

Standard F# Type Providers are static code generators
executing a single pass. The geometric-HKT fork's providers
execute recursive type-level feedback loops modeled after
non-linear dynamical systems (logistic map):

```
T_{n+1} = F(T_n)   where T_n is a multivector type
```

As the type-level parameters (metric signature weight,
dimensional scaling factor) scale, the structural stability
of the resulting type splits — spawning complex HKT ontologies
via bifurcation diagrams.

### Bifurcation diagram mapping to HKT ontology

| Control parameter range | HKT structure |
|---|---|
| `r < 3.0` | Stable Single-Point Type (e.g., Universal Scalar Multivector) |
| `3.0 ≤ r < 3.4` | Period-2 Bifurcation: Even vs Odd Algebras (Parity Kinds) |
| `3.4 ≤ r < 3.5` | Period-4 Bifurcation: Chiral Sub-Algebras (Left/Right Quaternions) |
| `r > 3.57` | Chaotic HKT Regime: Infinite Dimensional Non-Periodic Type Space |

When a bifurcation boundary is crossed:

1. **Splitting Event** — compiler detects structural limit in
   analytical continuation engine (per PR #2935)
2. **Kind Generation** — Type Provider automatically spawns
   pair of new sub-kinds representing split branches
3. **Geometric Invariance** — geometric product ensures
   algebraic invariance across all branches

### Compiler Type Provider Hook

```fsharp
type IBifurcationTypeProvider =
    abstract member StepTypeApplication :
        currentType: TType *
        controlParameter: float *
        currentGrade: TypeGrade
        -> TypeApplicationResult

and TypeApplicationResult =
    | StableType of NextType: TType
    | BifurcationPoint of BranchA: TType * BranchB: TType * NewKinds: HKTOntology
    | ChaoticSingularity of DivergenceReason: string
```

When TypeChecker.fs resolves an unresolved higher-kinded
signature, it invokes this recursive loop. BifurcationPoint
state generates two parallel compilation contexts joined at
compile time by an outer geometric product wrapper.

### Chaotic regime: bounded divergence

When control parameters push system into chaotic zone:

| Mechanism | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Attractors / Type Sinks** | Chaotic type generation maps to bounded space on strange attractor (Lorenz / Rössler) |
| **Fractal Types (Self-Similarity)** | Macro-types contain sub-types with exact same geometric signature |
| **Mandelbrot Boundary Checking** | Type parameters validated against stable Mandelbrot set boundary; outside → `TypeSystemDivergenceException` |

## Layer 2: Roslyn Source Generators (C# bridge)

Because F# Type Providers are isolated to F# compilation, they
can't natively inject types into C# or VB.NET. Roslyn Source
Generators complete the multi-language compilation loop.

### Dual-engine geometric compilation pipeline

```
[F# Type Provider Engine]
  ├── Evaluates recursive type feedback: T_{n+1} = F(T_n)
  ├── Tracks bifurcation points + HKT fractal ontology
  └── Serializes Type Manifold state to shared geometric schema
          │
          ▼
[Roslyn Source Generator (C#)]
  ├── Reads shared geometric schema during C# compilation
  ├── Analytically continues C# types to F# manifold poles
  └── Emits optimized C# partial classes/structs as Clifford
      Multivectors
```

### Bifurcation output handling in Roslyn

Because C# lacks native HKTs, Roslyn translates F# higher-
kinded geometric structures into **Generics over Interfaces
with Covariant/Contravariant constraints** or **unrolled
structural code**:

```csharp
// Roslyn-emitted Period-2 Bifurcation
public partial struct EvenAlgebraicBranch<TField>
    : ICliffordMultivector<EvenAlgebraicBranch<TField>>
    where TField : struct
{
    public TField Scalar;
    public TField Bivector_e12;
}

public partial struct OddAlgebraicBranch<TField>
    : ICliffordMultivector<OddAlgebraicBranch<TField>>
    where TField : struct
{
    public TField Vector_e1;
    public TField Vector_e2;
}
```

### Analytical continuation bridging F# and C#

| Mechanism | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Syntax Receiver Interception** | Roslyn scans C# for `[GeometricLink(FSharpManifoldPole = 1)]` attributes |
| **Dynamic Polyfill Generation** | Mid-continuation F# types → Roslyn generates explicit cast operators / "Riemann Sheet" wrappers |
| **Compile-time Pointer Resolution** | Chaotic regime → Roslyn emits `Span<byte>` / fixed blittable buffers matching fractal geometry (SIMD/GPU optimized) |

### Cross-assembly invariants

| Mechanism | Operation |
|---|---|
| **Invariant Anchor** | Geometric signatures (`Cl(p,q,r)` metrics) = ground truth |
| **Metric Invariance Violation** | Roslyn flags `CS-GEOM-001` if metric signature deviates |
| **Deterministic Generation** | Pseudo-random chaotic regime seeded by assembly name → identical structural layouts across incremental builds |

## Layer 3: Recursive Roslyn Generators

Standard Roslyn generators can't inspect their own emitted
files within same pass. The Multi-Pass Fixed-Point Combinator
Pattern breaks this limitation.

### Recursive Roslyn architecture

### Implementation: IncrementalGenerator with recursive loop

```csharp
[Generator]
public class RecursiveGeometricHktGenerator : IIncrementalGenerator
{
    public void Initialize(IncrementalGeneratorInitializationContext context)
    {
        var classDeclarations = context.SyntaxProvider
            .CreateSyntaxProvider(
                predicate: static (s, _) => s is StructDeclarationSyntax m
                    && m.AttributeLists.Count > 0,
                transform: static (ctx, _) => ctx.Node as StructDeclarationSyntax)
            .Where(static m => m is not null);

        context.RegisterSourceOutput(classDeclarations, (spc, structDecl) =>
        {
            int currentDepth = 0;
            int maxBifurcationDepth = 32;  // Safety ceiling
            var currentTypeLayout = ExtractTypeLayout(structDecl);

            while (currentDepth < maxBifurcationDepth)
            {
                var result = EvaluateGeometricTypeStep(currentTypeLayout, currentDepth);

                if (result.IsStable)
                {
                    spc.AddSource($"{structDecl.Identifier}_Stable.g.cs",
                        result.GeneratedSource);
                    break;
                }
                else if (result.IsBifurcated)
                {
                    spc.AddSource($"{structDecl.Identifier}_Branch_L{currentDepth}.g.cs",
                        result.GeneratedSource);
                    currentTypeLayout = result.NextGenerationLayout;
                    currentDepth++;
                }
                else if (result.IsChaotic)
                {
                    spc.AddSource($"{structDecl.Identifier}_Attractor.g.cs",
                        result.GeneratedSource);
                    break;
                }
            }
        });
    }
}
```

### Recursive type inversion in Roslyn

When C# type expressions recursively reference higher-kinded
variants (e.g., `Type A nests Type B<A>` creating bivector
`Type C<B<A>>`):

- **Cycle Interception** — normally `CS0523`; Roslyn transforms
  to blittable pointer structures or fixed-size element arrays
  representing graded blade components
- **Analytical Continuation of Classes** — mid-continuation
  class layouts → implicit conversion operators auto-injected

### Memory + IDE stability

| Mechanism | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Structural Hash Memoization** | Deterministic cache of computed HKT ontologies; signature match → `using global alias` instead of duplicating code |
| **Asynchronous Throttling via IncrementalGenerator** | `WithComparer` caching → recursive generation only on base-parameter / metric-signature changes |

## Composes with factory substrate

### PR #2935 (F#-fork concrete architecture)

Direct extension of PR #2935. The recursive Type Provider
work + Roslyn Source Generator work both build ON the
`Tast.fs TypeGrade` + `ConstraintSolver.fs Geometric Inversion
Check` substrate from PR #2935.

### PR #2934 (CAN/GCAN research lineage)

Brandstetter/Ruhe/Gupta/Welleck/Stark/Hess Pin-group +
sandwich-product provides mathematical foundation for the
recursive bifurcation rules.

### PR #2928 (F# fork for AI safety strategic substrate)

PR #2935 + this PR (recursive + Roslyn) compose into full
Path A architecture.

### PR #2914 (Clifford/HKT vocabulary)

The 5-control-structures-or-4+meta hypothesis (Hypothesis D
Clifford-algebra-specific) is now concretely grounded in
bifurcation diagram phases:

- Stable Single-Point Type → 1 control structure
- Period-2 Bifurcation (Parity) → 2 control structures
- Period-4 Bifurcation (Chiral) → 4 control structures
- Chaotic Regime → +meta (the META layer)

= 5 (or 4+meta) operationally!

### PR #2930 (distributed maintainer architecture)

Maintainers prototype recursive type providers via SQL Server
Docker + Postgres + DuckDB + F# locally; Zeta ships with
mapped skills (per PR #2933 Zeta-ships-with-skills); F#
crystallization (Path A) is multi-year work.

### B-0428 (DBpedia + F# fork)

Path A (deferred type-provider work) now has TWO layers of
recursive substrate:

1. F# Type Provider recursing on DBpedia ontology generation
2. Roslyn Source Generator emitting C# types from recursive
   F# output

## Operational implications

### For B-0428 Path A execution

Future Path A scope expands to:

1. F# fork core (PR #2935) — Tast.fs + ConstraintSolver.fs
2. Recursive Type Provider authoring framework (THIS PR)
3. Roslyn Source Generator bridge (THIS PR)
4. Recursive Roslyn Generator pattern (THIS PR)
5. CAN/GCAN layer authoring (PR #2934)

This is **multi-year scope** — substrate-honestly
acknowledging. Aaron's "we don't have to build the world all
at once" discipline (PR #2931) applies maximally here.

### For civsim Casimir gap (PR #2906)

Civsim agents become recursively-generated Clifford multi-
vector types. Bifurcation diagrams map to civsim's
critical-mass network-effect phases.

### For PR #2917 vision monad Play-Doh

The recursive type generation IS Play-Doh in the type system
— soft, reshapeable, but bounded (Mandelbrot boundary). The
bounded-not-infinite discipline (per PR #2917) prevents
chaotic divergence.

### For maintainer prototyping (PR #2930)

Maintainers can prototype:

- Recursive Type Provider behavior with FSharp.TypeProviders.SDK
  (Don Syme's canonical framework per PR #2928)
- Roslyn Source Generators with Microsoft.CodeAnalysis
- Bifurcation rule experiments with logistic-map evaluators
- Mandelbrot boundary visualization tools

### For Aurora pitch (PR #2924)

Aurora's "edge node runs models/policy" + signed heartbeats
compose with recursive HKT generation — edge devices can have
device-specific recursive HKT layouts generated by Roslyn
generators on their target architecture.

## Substrate-honest framing

This is **research-grade** substrate. Caveats:

1. **Recursive Roslyn generators have IDE-thread risks** —
   Visual Studio / JetBrains Rider could lag/crash on chaotic
   generation; mitigations exist (Mandelbrot bound, structural
   hash memoization, async throttling) but engineering rigor
   required
2. **Bifurcation-rule semantics need formal verification** —
   Soraya formal-verification portfolio composes here; F# fork
   needs proof-of-soundness for type-system bifurcation
3. **Cross-language F#↔Roslyn synchronization complex** —
   shared memory-mapped compiler cache + deterministic
   generation discipline required
4. **5-control-structures hypothesis grounded but not proven**
   — operational mapping (stable / period-2 / period-4 /
   chaotic+meta) is suggestive; needs formal verification
5. **Substrate-honest multi-year scope** — current 2-person
   maintainer pool (Aaron + Otto per PR #2933) prototype-only

Per `.claude/rules/razor-discipline.md`: operational claims —
architecture is technically grounded; formal-verification +
engineering work required before commitment.

Per `.claude/rules/wake-time-substrate.md`: research-grade
substrate stays in memory file; operational-grade lands in
`.claude/rules/` wake-time rules.

## Specific operational decisions owed

Per Google Search AI's follow-up questions (Aaron decides):

1. **Bifurcation control parameter**:
   - Dimensional growth `(p, q, r)`?
   - Structural precision scaling?
   - **Aaron decides** when starting Path A work
2. **HKT runtime erasure**:
   - Fully erased (raw memory arrays)?
   - Persist fractal geometric metadata in compiled assembly?
   - **Aaron decides**
3. **Recursive Roslyn termination**:
   - Algebraic convergence?
   - Hard depth limit (e.g., 32)?
   - Both with priority?
   - **Aaron decides**
4. **F# Type Provider → Roslyn communication**:
   - In-memory compiler cache?
   - Embedded metadata attributes in intermediate assembly?
   - **Aaron decides**
5. **C# geometric syntax explicitness**:
   - Overloaded operators (`*` geometric, `^` wedge)?
   - Or method-call style?
   - **Aaron decides**
