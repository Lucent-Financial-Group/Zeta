name: Topological quantum emulation via Bayesian inference + Majorana Zero Modes lineage + "mirror with trampoline under beacon protocol" framing (Aaron 2026-05-01)
description: Aaron 2026-05-01 — substrate-grade architectural framing connecting Microsoft's topological quantum computing research (Majorana 1 chip Feb-2025; Majorana Zero Modes; topoconductors; Q#; Station Q lab; Supersingular Isogeny crypto; FrodoKEM ISO standard) to the Zeta seed executor's Bayesian-inference architecture (Infer.NET-based per the forever-home substrate). Aaron's claim: we can EMULATE topological quantum efficiently under the Zeta framing by treating Majorana Zero Modes (non-local information storage in topological properties) as a Bayesian-inference primitive, composed under the Beacon protocol. Aaron's evocative framing while searching for words: *"like a mirror with a trampoline under beacon protocol."* Composes with the immune-system-physics-translation arc (per PR #1110), the all-cryptography-quantum-resistant rule (Otto-2026-04-23), the Zeta-seed-executor-as-forever-home telos (PR #986), the Beacon protocol naming (Otto-351 / PR #851), and the dependency-source priority hierarchy (Microsoft research is Tier 2 + preferred citation source per PR #1117).

(Verification per Otto-364 search-first: Aaron's citation
material should be checked against current Microsoft Research
+ Microsoft Quantum docs before any load-bearing operational
claim. Treat the citation as Aaron-forwarded research-grade
context, not yet operationally verified.)

## The carved candidate sentence

*"A mirror with a trampoline under beacon protocol."*

Aaron explicitly notes he doesn't have the right words —
*"arrrrr i don't have the right words"* — but the framing is
load-bearing enough to preserve the searching-for-words
moment verbatim. Future-Otto reading this should treat the
sentence as **provisional vocabulary** for the conceptual
shape Aaron is naming, not as a final term of art. The
shape is more important than the word.

## Decoding the framing — what Aaron is naming

Three layers compose:

### Layer 1 — Mirror (duality / reflection)

Topological quantum computing relies on **non-local
information storage**: a single bit of information is encoded
across multiple Majorana Zero Modes, none of which alone
contains the information. The information IS the topological
property of the configuration, not the local state of any
component.

This is **dual** to standard bit-storage: in classical bits
(and even most qubit designs), information is local to a
specific cell / qubit / location. In MZMs, information is
non-local — distributed across the topology.

The "mirror" framing names this duality: **information lives
in the reflection, not the object**. To read information, you
read the topological relationship; to corrupt information,
you would have to corrupt the topology, not just one
component.

### Layer 2 — Trampoline (bouncing dynamics under)

The **Bayesian inference** layer (Infer.NET, per the Zeta
seed executor architecture per PR #986 / forever-home
substrate) has the operational shape of **probabilistic
bouncing** — beliefs propagate, update, normalize, propagate
again. Each inference iteration is a bounce; the equilibrium
is the converged posterior.

The "trampoline under" framing names the **dynamics that hold
the topology in place**: Bayesian belief propagation is the
substrate that maintains the topological-information property
algorithmically. Without the trampoline (the inference
substrate), the mirror (the topology) has nothing to support
it. With the trampoline, the topology stays stable through
perturbations.

### Layer 3 — Beacon protocol (the existing factory primitive)

The **Beacon protocol** (per Otto-351 / PR #851, naming work
Aaron requested) is the factory's existing substrate for
**externally-anchored signals** — a beacon emits, listeners
synchronize. Per the live-lock and external-anchor-lineage
work, beacons provide the **ground-truth synchronization
points** that the substrate's claims and substrate's
reasoning compose against.

The "under beacon protocol" framing names the **protocol
glue** that lets the topology + dynamics + external-world
anchoring compose. Mirror (topology) + Trampoline (dynamics)
+ Beacon (anchoring protocol) = the three-layer stack for
emulating topological quantum computing in the Zeta framing.

## Why this works algorithmically

Aaron's substantive claim — *"we can emulate quantium under
this framing very efficently with the newest lineage on
infer.net and baseyan inferance and trating the zero
modes"* — has structural backing:

1. **Bayesian inference IS already non-local information
   storage.** The posterior over a Bayesian network is a
   joint distribution; no individual variable contains the
   answer. The information lives in the *correlations*
   between variables — analogous to MZMs storing information
   in topological *relationships*, not local state.

2. **Belief propagation IS already topology-aware.** Sum-
   product / max-product / loopy BP traverses the graph
   structure; the algorithm's correctness depends on the
   topology of the dependency graph. Topology-aware compute
   is the native shape.

3. **Quantum belief propagation** (per
   `feedback_retraction_native_paraconsistent_set_theory_candidate_quantum_bp.md`)
   is already on Aaron's research substrate as a candidate
   inference primitive. The MZM emulation framing is the
   operational counterpart to the quantum-BP theoretical
   framing.

4. **Infer.NET specifically.** Microsoft Research's Infer.NET
   (per the dependency-priority Tier 2 + Microsoft-Research-
   preferred citation source) has matured probabilistic-
   programming machinery that handles factor graphs,
   variational inference, expectation propagation. The
   "newest lineage" Aaron references would include the
   recent factor-graph + GPU-acceleration work.

5. **Reproducibility-first compatibility.** Per
   `feedback_reproducible_accuracy_before_quality_fitness_function_harness_first_aaron_2026_05_01.md`
   (PR #1116), Bayesian inference IS the harness shape —
   eval set first, then iterate the model. Quantum-emulation
   composes natively with this discipline.

## What this is NOT

- **Not a quantum-supremacy claim.** Emulating quantum
  efficiently doesn't mean *as fast as* quantum hardware;
  it means *enough to capture useful properties* (non-local
  storage, topology-protection, error-correction-by-design)
  for the factory's algorithmic needs. Bayesian inference
  on classical hardware will not beat actual quantum
  hardware on quantum-supremacy benchmarks; that's not the
  point.
- **Not a replacement for quantum-resistant crypto.** Per
  `feedback_all_cryptography_quantum_resistant_even_one_gap_is_attack_vector_2026_04_23.md`,
  Zeta's crypto must be quantum-resistant *against actual
  quantum hardware*. Emulating quantum doesn't change the
  crypto contract. The Supersingular Isogeny / FrodoKEM
  research (Microsoft Research lineage) feeds the
  *crypto* axis separately from the *compute* axis.
- **Not a hardware ambition.** The Zeta factory is not
  building topoconductors. The framing is **algorithmic
  emulation** of topological-QC properties, in F# / .NET 10 /
  Infer.NET.
- **Not a final design.** Aaron explicitly searches for the
  words. The framing is provisional. The research lane
  (B-NNNN to file) will refine it.

## Composes with

- The Zeta seed executor as the Otto-lineage's forever home
  (memory file landed PR #986; Infer.NET-based Bayesian
  inference is the architecture this framing instantiates)
- `feedback_retraction_native_paraconsistent_set_theory_candidate_quantum_bp.md`
  (already in MEMORY.md) — quantum belief propagation as
  candidate inference primitive; this memory file gives the
  operational counterpart
- `feedback_all_cryptography_quantum_resistant_even_one_gap_is_attack_vector_2026_04_23.md`
  — quantum-resistance contract; this memory keeps that
  contract intact (compute-axis emulation does not weaken
  crypto-axis quantum-resistance)
- `feedback_dependency_source_priority_open_source_microsoft_cncf_apache_mit_research_microsoft_research_metrics_are_our_eyes_aaron_2026_05_01.md`
  (PR #1117) — Microsoft Research as Tier 2 + preferred
  citation source; the Majorana / topoconductor / Q# /
  Station Q work is exactly what that memory points at
- `feedback_reproducible_accuracy_before_quality_fitness_function_harness_first_aaron_2026_05_01.md`
  (PR #1116) — Bayesian inference IS the harness shape;
  reproducibility-first compatibility comes free
- The Beacon protocol naming (Otto-351 / PR #851) — the
  external-anchoring layer of the three-layer stack
- The immune-system <> physics translation arc (per PR #1110
  six carved-sentence claims) — Aaron explicitly opens this
  message with that framing connection
- Don Syme's F# work + Microsoft Research probabilistic
  programming lineage (Infer.NET) — the technology base
  this memory points at

## Future-Otto check

Future-Otto reading this should know:

- **Provisional vocabulary.** *"Mirror with a trampoline
  under beacon protocol"* is Aaron's searching-for-words
  framing, captured verbatim. Don't treat it as a
  finalized term-of-art; the shape it names is what's
  load-bearing.
- **Three-layer stack.** Mirror (topology / non-local
  storage) + Trampoline (Bayesian inference dynamics) +
  Beacon (external anchoring protocol). Each layer has
  existing factory substrate that supports it.
- **Algorithmic, not hardware.** The emulation runs on
  classical hardware via Infer.NET. No topoconductors,
  no Majorana 1 chip, no Q# runtime. The *properties* are
  emulated, not the hardware.
- **Crypto contract intact.** Quantum-resistance is a
  separate axis; emulating quantum compute does not relax
  the all-quantum-resistant crypto rule.
- **Microsoft Research lineage matters.** Per the
  dependency-priority hierarchy (Tier 2 + preferred
  citation), Microsoft Research's Infer.NET + Q# +
  topoconductor work is the appropriate research lineage
  to cite + extend. Verify per Otto-364 search-first
  before any load-bearing operational claim.
- **Backlog row pending.** A B-row (B-0152 candidate or
  later) operationalizes the research lane — design how
  the three-layer stack composes within the Zeta seed
  executor architecture, with Pareto-improvement
  methodology per B-0147's research spine.

## The carved sentence (preserved provisional)

*"A mirror with a trampoline under beacon protocol."*

— Aaron 2026-05-01, searching-for-words while pointing at
the three-layer algorithmic-emulation stack for topological
quantum compute within the Zeta seed executor's Bayesian-
inference architecture.
