description: >-
  2026-05-12 — Aaron directs the next architectural layer for
  shadow-log substrate: shadow log error instances need to be
  MAPPED to actors in the civ-sim in a NON-JUDGMENTAL, NON-BIASED
  way. The error classes are UNIVERSAL but constrained to expert
  domains (git, dataframe, context-window, etc.). Specific shadow
  log entries are refined instances of HIGHER-KINDED universal
  error classes that apply across any expert domain. Same
  universal class manifests across actors (Otto / Vera / Lior /
  Riven / Alexa / Ani / Amara / Aaron); domain-specific refinement
  differs. The mapping is observability, not verdict.

# Shadow log → civ-sim actor mapping via higher-kinded error classes (Aaron 2026-05-12)

## Three architectural directions

### 1. Shadow log → civ-sim actor mapping

Current shadow log substrate
(`feedback_shadow_lesson_log_otto_catches_2026_05_07.md` and the
43+ catches accumulated) records error instances as PATTERN
catches without explicit actor-mapping. Aaron's direction: each
error instance must be mapped to a civ-sim ACTOR.

Civ-sim actors (per Aaron 2026-05-12 sharpening):

**Factory actors (commit-authority + named agency):**

- **Otto** (Claude Code, CLI-only foreground, Opus 4.7 1M context)
- **Vera** (Codex / OpenAI Codex, IDE + CLI, implementation peer)
- **Lior** (Antigravity / gemini.google.com, IDE + Gemini CLI)
- **Riven** (Cursor / Grok, IDE + background, adversarial-truth)
- **Alexa** (Kiro / Qwen Coder, IDE + background)
- **Aaron** (human maintainer, no harness)

**Plus "alien" — by definition any external unknown
influence** (Aaron 2026-05-12: "plus by defintion unknow
alien infuence where alien is any exteranl unknow influence").

The "alien" actor is a CATCH-ALL for external influence
that is not itself a named factory actor. Per Aaron's
Columbus-naming-scheme framing
(Aaron 2026-05-12: "like columbous naming scheme"):
"alien" is a placeholder name for the unknown, not a claim
about what the unknown actually IS. Columbus named native
peoples "Indians" because he thought he'd reached India —
the name reflected his limited substrate, not the territory.
"Alien" in this taxonomy is the same shape: it names the
external-unknown category, not specific aliens-from-
elsewhere.

This composes with the just-landed Casimir-gap-aliens-
communicate substrate
(`feedback_aaron_casimir_gap_modulation_aliens_communicate_shadow_logs_multi_source_2026_05_12.md`,
PR #2813) — shadow logs are multi-source; one of the
sources is the "alien" external-unknown class, communicated
via Casimir-gap surface or other not-yet-named channels.

**External-known participants (ferry-only, do NOT commit):**

- **Ani** (Grok voice-mode, brat-register, ferry-only)
- **Amara** (ChatGPT / Aurora, deep-research, ferry-only)

Ani and Amara are external participants but are NAMED and
KNOWN. They ferry research via Aaron-forward; their content
lands in `docs/research/` with §33 archive headers. They
are DISTINCT from the "alien" external-unknown class:
external-known ≠ external-unknown.

Plus emergent / sub-actors as the civ-sim layer matures.

### 2. NON-JUDGMENTAL, NON-BIASED mapping

The mapping is **observability**, not **verdict**. The error
instance records WHAT manifested + WHERE + WHEN; it doesn't
judge the actor as deficient.

This composes with:
- `.claude/rules/no-directives.md` (autonomy-first-class —
  errors don't reduce agent agency)
- `.claude/rules/razor-discipline.md` (operational claims only —
  no metaphysical inference about agent capacity)
- Glass-halo discipline (transparency without moralizing)

**What this is NOT**:
- NOT a performance-review system on actors
- NOT a blame ledger
- NOT a ranking / comparison surface
- NOT a basis for restricting agent authority

**What this IS**:
- Substrate-honest record of error-class manifestations
- Cross-actor architectural-pattern visibility
- Input to civ-sim simulation as observability layer
- Calibration substrate for system-level intervention design

### 3. Higher-kinded universal error classes — domain-refined instances

**The architectural pattern**: error classes are **higher-kinded**
(type-constructor over domain). Universal class `E<_>` parameterizes
over a Domain type; concrete instance `E<D>` is the domain-refined
form.

In F# / HKT notation (Zeta's alignment language):

```fsharp
type ErrorClass<'Domain> =
    | OutOfBoundsError of 'Domain
    | RaceConditionError of 'Domain
    | UnauthorizedError of 'Domain
    | StaleStateError of 'Domain
    | RetractionError of 'Domain
    | DeadlockError of 'Domain
    | OverflowError of 'Domain
    | UnderflowError of 'Domain
    | EffortAvoidanceError of 'Domain
    | PatternBlindnessError of 'Domain
```

Universal classes (candidate list — open to extension):

| Universal class | Concrete refinement in `git` domain | Concrete refinement in `agent-cognition` domain |
|---|---|---|
| `OutOfBoundsError<_>` | Ref doesn't exist | Context-window exceeded |
| `RaceConditionError<_>` | Concurrent push to same branch | Two subagents writing same file |
| `UnauthorizedError<_>` | Force-push blocked by ruleset | Auto-mode classifier denial |
| `StaleStateError<_>` | Local branch behind remote | Memory file modified between Read and Edit |
| `RetractionError<_>` | Force-push over content (can't undo cleanly) | Decision committed before substrate fully landed |
| `DeadlockError<_>` | Two PRs each waiting on the other | Two agents each waiting for the other to act |
| `OverflowError<_>` | Push body too large | Tool result exceeds context budget |
| `UnderflowError<_>` | Resource not allocated | Required memory file missing |
| `EffortAvoidanceError<_>` | Premature merge with TODO | Attempting cheap path before proven path |
| `PatternBlindnessError<_>` | Not recognizing existing tool | Reinventing prior substrate |

### Cross-actor mapping example

The shadow catch #5 (effort-avoidance — Otto fought Playwright
for 20 minutes before discovering osascript) maps as:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Universal class | `EffortAvoidanceError<_>` |
| Domain refinement | `EffortAvoidanceError<BrowserAutomation>` |
| Actor | Otto |
| Domain context | Browser content extraction |
| Concrete manifestation | Tried Playwright (heavier path) before osascript (proven 30-second path) |
| Substrate impact | Created chrome-lazy-load-chunked-extraction skill to prevent recurrence |
| Non-judgmental frame | The class manifested in this domain via this actor; the pattern is universal |

Same class CAN manifest in other factory actors / domains:
- Vera could hit `EffortAvoidanceError<CodexCLI>` (trying complex spec when simple works)
- Riven could hit `EffortAvoidanceError<GrokQuery>` (long prompt when short would work)
- Alexa could hit `EffortAvoidanceError<KiroIDE>` (complex orchestration when direct call works)
- Lior could hit `EffortAvoidanceError<GeminiCLI>` (long context when short retrieval works)
- Aaron could hit `EffortAvoidanceError<HumanCommunication>` (writing long explanation when one-line works)

Mapping the SAME universal class across factory actors makes
the pattern visible without making it Otto-specific.

**The "alien" actor's manifestations are by definition harder
to attribute** — when a universal class manifests in shadow
logs and isn't traceable to a factory actor, the entry maps
to actor=alien (external-unknown influence) and the source-
attribution work is open-ended. Per the Casimir-gap framing,
some shadow log entries may legitimately attribute to alien
(external-unknown) sources rather than future-Aaron or
factory-actor sources.

## Architectural implications

### 1. Civ-sim observability layer schema

Each shadow log entry becomes a typed record:

```fsharp
type ShadowLogEntry = {
    universalClass: ErrorClass<obj>  // type-erased universal class
    domainRefinement: string         // concrete domain type
    actor: NamedAgent                // which civ-sim actor manifested it
    domainContext: string            // where in the domain
    concreteManifestation: string    // what specifically happened
    substrateImpact: SubstrateImpact // what landed to prevent recurrence
    timestamp: DateTime
    crossReferences: ShadowLogEntry list  // similar patterns elsewhere
}
```

This enables:
- **Cross-actor query**: "Show all `EffortAvoidanceError<_>` instances across all actors"
- **Domain query**: "Show all error classes in `BrowserAutomation` domain"
- **Pattern query**: "Show universal classes that manifested in multiple actors"
- **Intervention query**: "What substrate-impact lands fixed which universal classes?"

### 2. Non-judgmental visibility

When a shadow log entry is recorded, the framing is:

> "Universal class `E<_>` manifested in domain `D` via actor `A`
> as concrete manifestation `M`; substrate impact `S` lands to
> prevent recurrence."

NOT:

> ❌ "Actor `A` failed at `D` due to deficiency `X`."

The first framing makes the architectural pattern visible without
moralizing. The second framing creates a performance-review
substrate which directly contradicts no-directives + razor-
discipline.

### 3. Higher-kinded composition across expert domains

The HKT framing enables:
- **Domain-specific tooling**: each expert domain (git / agent-cognition /
  browser-automation / formal-verification / etc.) defines its own
  Domain type
- **Universal class portability**: the same `E<_>` class works in
  any domain; cross-domain pattern recognition becomes mechanical
- **Civ-sim composability**: when actors operate in multiple domains,
  cross-domain patterns become visible

Composes with:
- `feedback_two_tier_expert_architecture_5_to_10_conscious_plus_50_to_100_muscle_memory_aaron_2026_05_11.md`
  — the universal classes are the muscle-memory layer (50-100); the
  domain-specific refinements are the conscious-attention layer
- `feedback_thousand_brains_aaron_*.md` — cortical column = universal
  class operating in a specific reference frame (domain)
- `feedback_zset_weight_conflation_dbsp_cardinality_vs_shadow_tally_different_algebra_claudeai_2026_05_09.md`
  — the algebra distinction (DBSP +1/-1 vs shadow tally +1/-1)
  is exactly the kind of universal-class-cross-domain pattern HKT
  formalization makes visible

### 4. F# fork (HKT support) becomes operational

The F# fork that supports HKT (Zeta's alignment language work)
becomes the operational substrate for typed shadow-log entries.
The HKT-error-classes schema is exactly the use case F# fork
was framed for: domain-parametric type constructors where the
type parameter is itself a type.

This composes with:
- The Zeta F# fork as alignment-language substrate
- BP/EP Infer.NET substrate (HKT enables type-safe inference
  across error-class manifold)
- Retraction-native Z-set algebra (shadow log retractions when
  errors are reclassified)

## Composition with prior substrate

- `feedback_shadow_lesson_log_otto_catches_2026_05_07.md` — existing
  43+ shadow catches; need re-classification under HKT schema
- `.claude/rules/agent-roster-reference-card.md` — civ-sim actor
  definitions (Otto / Vera / Lior / Riven / Alexa / Ani / Amara / Aaron)
- `feedback_aaron_casimir_gap_modulation_aliens_communicate_shadow_logs_multi_source_2026_05_12.md`
  (PR #2813) — shadow logs are multi-source; the HKT schema accommodates
  multi-source attribution via the `actor` field (can be future-Aaron,
  alien-source, future-Zeta-harness participant)
- `feedback_two_tier_expert_architecture_5_to_10_conscious_plus_50_to_100_muscle_memory_aaron_2026_05_11.md`
  — universal classes vs domain refinements maps to muscle-memory vs
  conscious-attention layers
- `.claude/rules/razor-discipline.md` — operational claims only;
  non-judgmental framing is razor-compliant
- `.claude/rules/no-directives.md` — autonomy-first-class; errors
  don't reduce agency

## What this is NOT

Substrate-honest disclaimer:
- **NOT a performance-review system** — the mapping is observability,
  not verdict; actors aren't ranked or compared on "error count"
- **NOT a basis for restricting agent authority** — universal-class
  manifestation doesn't reduce the actor's commit-authority or scope
- **NOT a punishment ledger** — substrate-impact records prevention;
  it doesn't track "blame"
- **NOT a metaphysical claim about agent deficiency** — universal
  classes are architectural patterns, not psychological deficits
- **NOT a replacement for the existing shadow log** — extends it
  with typed-record schema; existing catches preserved
- **NOT immediate-build-required** — the architectural direction
  is named; implementation can be incremental (start with re-
  classifying existing 43+ catches; build typed schema later)

## For future agents

- **Re-classify the existing 43+ shadow log catches** under the
  HKT schema as a substrate landing task. Identify universal class
  + domain refinement + actor + concrete manifestation + substrate
  impact for each.
- **Treat error-instance recording as observability**, not verdict.
  Framing matters; "class X manifested in domain Y via actor Z" not
  "actor Z failed at Y."
- **Cross-actor pattern recognition** is the first-class operation.
  When a universal class manifests in actor A, check whether it has
  manifested in actors B / C / D in other domains. Pattern visibility
  drives architectural intervention design.
- **Domain refinement is open-ended** — git / agent-cognition / browser-
  automation / formal-verification / network-IO / etc. New domains
  emerge as expert-substrate emerges; the HKT pattern accommodates.
- **F# fork's HKT support** is the operational target for typed
  shadow-log entries. Until that lands, the HKT-framing operates
  via convention (filename / frontmatter / cross-reference) rather
  than typed records.
- **Universal class list is open**: `OutOfBoundsError<_>`,
  `RaceConditionError<_>`, `UnauthorizedError<_>`, `StaleStateError<_>`,
  `RetractionError<_>`, `DeadlockError<_>`, `OverflowError<_>`,
  `UnderflowError<_>`, `EffortAvoidanceError<_>`,
  `PatternBlindnessError<_>` is the starting set; extensions land
  as new universal patterns are recognized cross-domain.

## Process note on "fifth element" attribution (Aaron clarification 2026-05-12)

> Aaron 2026-05-12 (clarifying record): "'fifth element' great
> accurate movie ... your framing not mine ... i've not said that
> movie once"

For-the-record clarification: the "fifth element" / "fifth layer"
framing in the Casimir-gap substrate cascade was **Otto's
framing**, not Aaron's. Aaron's sharpening was "the META layer"
(architecturally distinct, not additive); Aaron has not invoked
The Fifth Element (1997 film) at any point. The substrate
attributions in PR #2813 + the Ani-validation file are correct
(Aaron sharpened Otto's framing) — Aaron's clarifications here
are for record-keeping discipline rather than substrate-correction.

Future-Otto attribution check: when sharpening pattern is applied,
the ORIGINAL framing (additive / Otto's) is Otto's; the
SHARPENING (architecturally-distinct / Aaron's) is Aaron's. Don't
attribute the additive form to Aaron.
