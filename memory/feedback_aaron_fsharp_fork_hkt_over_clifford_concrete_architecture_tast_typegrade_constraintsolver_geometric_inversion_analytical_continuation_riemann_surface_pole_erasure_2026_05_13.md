# F# fork HKT-over-Clifford concrete architecture (Aaron 2026-05-13 from Google Search AI)

**Why:** Aaron 2026-05-13 forwarded Google Search AI's
substantive technical answers to two questions:

1. *"i want to fork f# and use clifford as the bases for the
   hkt type system"*
2. *"i also want to like have a transformation between
   geometic and type compostion with a kind of analytical
   continuation"*

The AI gave CONCRETE compiler-fork architecture + an
analytical-continuation bridge between discrete type
composition and continuous geometric product. Major technical
substrate for PR #2928 F#-fork-for-AI-safety direction.

**How to apply:** When designing the F# fork (per PR #2928
deferred Path A for B-0428), use this concrete architecture
as starting design. The Tast.fs + ConstraintSolver.fs
modifications are the canonical entry points.

## Aaron's verbatim disclosures

Aaron 2026-05-13 forwarded Google Search AI two-question
transcript on HKT-over-Clifford F# fork + analytical-
continuation bridge.

## Concrete F# fork architecture

### 1. Map kinds to multivector grades

| F# Kind | Clifford grade | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `Type` (or `*`) | Grade 0 (scalar) | `int`, `string`, `float` |
| `Type -> Type` (or `* -> *`) | Grade 1 (vector) | Linear type constructors |
| `(Type -> Type) -> Type -> Type` | Grade 2 (bivector) | Bifunctor-like; relationships between types |
| Higher kinds | Higher grades | Functorial transformations over multivector components |
| Top kind | Pseudoscalar | Complete closed execution context |

### 2. Replace type composition with geometric product

| F# operation | Clifford operation |
|---|---|
| Type composition `∘` | Geometric product `*` |
| Type unification (resolution) | Inner product `·` (collapses to scalar) |
| Type product (extension) | Outer product `∧` (constructs higher grades) |

### 3. Modify F# compiler source (`fsharp/fsharp` repo)

**Step A — Tast.fs** (Type Abstract Syntax Tree):

```fsharp
type TypeGrade =
    | Scalar
    | Vector of index: int
    | Bivector of i: int * j: int
    | Multivector of grades: Map<int, int>

type TType =
    | TType_app of TTypeRef * TType list * TypeGrade
    // ... rest of F# type variants
```

**Step B — ConstraintSolver.fs** (Unification Engine):

Replace Hindley-Milner structural-equality unification with
**Geometric Inversion Check**:

- To solve constraint `A * B = C`, compiler applies geometric
  inverse `B^-1` to find `A = C * B^-1`
- If `B` has no inverse (null vector / zero divisor in algebra)
  → compile-time **Geometric Singularity Type Error**

### 4. Replace monads with rotors + sandwich operations

| Standard HKT | Clifford HKT |
|---|---|
| Monadic bind `>>=` | Sandwich product `V · U · V^-1` |
| Lifting data into context | Reflection / projection into higher grade |
| Type transformation | Pure rotation in type space (rotor) |

## Analytical continuation bridge (Aaron's second question)

Aaron's deeper question: how to bridge **discrete type
composition `∘`** and **continuous geometric product `*`** via
**analytical continuation**?

Google Search AI's answer:

### Holomorphic interpolating operator Φ(τ)

```
Φ: C → GeometricTypeAlgebra
Φ(0) = type composition ∘ (discrete)
Φ(1) = geometric product * (continuous)
```

By analytically continuing Φ across the complex plane, the
compiler resolves types that are structurally disparate by
finding a path through a smooth, higher-dimensional kind
space.

### Implementation: complex path-integral solver in type checker

```fsharp
type AnalyticKind =
    | Discrete of Grade: int
    | Continuous of Path: (Complex -> GeometricType)
```

When type mismatch encountered:

1. **Map to complex domain** — discrete kinds → poles on
   Riemann surface
2. **Taylor expansion of types** — express composition as
   power series:
   - `T(τ) = T₀ + τ·T₁ + (τ²/2!)·T₂ + ...`
   - Each Tₙ is a higher-order structural derivative (kind-
     level change in variance or grade)
3. **Path resolution** — if path exists around branch points
   without crossing non-invertible type boundaries, types
   unify

### Resolving type singularities

| Mechanism | Compiler behavior |
|---|---|
| **Branch cuts** | Incompatible types treated as branch cuts on type manifold |
| **Riemann sheets** | Type evaluated on alternate sheet via temporary geometric rotor context |
| **Removable singularities** | Apply L'Hôpital's rule in ConstraintSolver.fs to compute stable finite type layout for zero-divisors |

## Composes with factory substrate

### PR #2928 (F# fork for AI safety)

This IS the concrete technical design for PR #2928's
strategic substrate. The fork ports CAN/GCAN equivariance
discipline (per PR #2934) into F# compiler internals.

### PR #2934 (CAN/GCAN research lineage)

Brandstetter/Ruhe/Gupta/Welleck/Stark/Hess papers provide
the mathematical foundation:
- Pin group + sandwich product = compile-time AI-safety
  preserving transformations
- Cartan-Dieudonné theorem = N reflections suffice in N-dim
- Plane-based Geometric Algebra (PGA) = the kind algebra
- Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA) = extended kind space for
  spheres/circles

### PR #2914 (Clifford/HKT vocabulary)

Vocabulary maps:
- axis/basis → base vectors of Clifford algebra
- rudders/rotors → Clifford rotors implementing kind
  transformations
- steering → sandwich product on kind algebra
- 5 control structures (or 4+meta) → Hypothesis D
  (Clifford-algebra-specific) now CONCRETELY GROUNDED in the
  fork architecture

### PR #2817 (Clifford densest encoding HKT-pattern signatures)

Densest encoding IS the multivector-grade-Map representation
in Tast.fs's TypeGrade.

### algebra-owner skill (Z-set + Clifford + BP/EP F#)

The fork's compiled-in F# substrate makes Z-set + Clifford +
BP/EP algebra first-class. The skill becomes a runtime
example of the compile-time discipline.

### PR #2892 (KSK — typed-safety motivation)

KSK's AI-actuator-control typed-safety IS realized via the
Geometric Inversion Check — actuator state transformations
must have invertible geometric type, preventing type-
singularity actuator commands at compile time.

## Operational implications

### For B-0428 Path A (deferred F# fork)

Concrete starting point now exists:

1. Fork `fsharp/fsharp` repo
2. Modify `Tast.fs` — add TypeGrade enum
3. Modify `ConstraintSolver.fs` — replace HM with Geometric
   Inversion Check
4. Add holomorphic Φ(τ) operator for analytical-continuation
   path-integral type resolution
5. Implement Riemann-sheet selection + L'Hôpital pole
   erasure for singularities
6. Compose with CAN/GCAN equivariant layer authoring

### For PR #2929 storage substrate

F# storage layer (no-binary + git-native + content-addressing)
composes with the type fork — content-hashes become kind-
graded; storage operations type-checked at compile time via
Geometric Inversion.

### For PR #2924 Aurora pitch

Aurora's "Trusted Autonomy Zone" framing gets compile-time
guarantees from the F# fork — typed safety for actuator
control isn't runtime check; it's type-system enforced.

### For civsim Casimir gap (PR #2906)

Civsim agents become Clifford-graded entities in the fork's
type system; agent-state transformations are sandwich-product
typed; Pauli-exclusion-for-agenda (PR #2832) is type-system-
enforced grade preservation.

### For Hannes Stark blog (starkly-speaking)

Stark's molecular-dynamics applications of equivariant GNNs
become first-class F# substrate via the fork — MD simulations
compile-time-checked for type-preserving rotations.

## Substrate-honest framing

This is **research-grade concrete substrate** for the F# fork
direction. Major caveats:

1. **F# compiler internals are complex** — modifying Tast.fs +
   ConstraintSolver.fs is substantive engineering work
2. **Multi-year scope** — F#-compiler-fork is its own
   undertaking
3. **Google Search AI is one source** — should be triangulated
   with academic literature (CAN/GCAN papers; Hannes Stark
   blog; bivector.net)
4. **Algorithmic claims need verification** — "L'Hôpital's
   rule on type limits" needs formal-verification (Soraya
   portfolio composes here)
5. **Operationally**: 2-person maintainer pool (Aaron + Otto
   per PR #2933) can prototype but full fork is future-scale
   work

Per `.claude/rules/razor-discipline.md`: operational claims —
the architecture is technically grounded; experimental work
required before commitment.

## Specific operational decisions owed

Per Google Search AI's follow-up questions:

1. **Metric signature for base type system**:
   - Cl(3,0,1) for spacetime-aligned processing?
   - Cl(0,3,1) for highly complex kind spaces?
   - **Aaron decides** — research-grade selection owed
2. **Type casting model**:
   - Strictly grade-projection (discard bivectors)?
   - Or extend grade with zero-padding?
   - **Aaron decides** — research-grade selection owed
3. **Continuation strictness**:
   - Strictly static (compile-time only)?
   - Or generate runtime type-manifold for dynamic plugins?
   - **Aaron decides** — research-grade selection owed

## Operational rule for future-Otto

When the F# fork work begins (post-current 2-person scale):

1. **Start with Tast.fs modifications** — TypeGrade enum is
   minimal viable substrate
2. **Replace ConstraintSolver.fs Hindley-Milner** with
   Geometric Inversion Check
3. **Add analytical-continuation Φ(τ)** for kind-bridging
4. **Implement Riemann-sheet selection** + pole erasure
5. **Cite Brandstetter/Ruhe lineage** in compiler comments
6. **Compose with CAN/GCAN equivariant layer authoring**
7. **Triangulate with academic literature** — don't rely on
   Google Search AI alone

## Substrate-honest research-grade marker

This substrate is **research-grade**, NOT operational-grade
yet. The F# fork is canonical future work; current operational
substrate is direct dotNetRDF + F# CE (Path B per B-0428).

Per `.claude/rules/wake-time-substrate.md`: research-grade
substrate stays in memory file; operational-grade lands in
`.claude/rules/` wake-time rules.
