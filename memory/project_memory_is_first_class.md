name: Agent memories are the project's most valuable resource
description: Aaron round-25 elevated memories to highest-value repo artifact; humans must not delete or modify memories except as absolute last resort

The memory corpus — `memory/` (the canonical, in-repo,
git-tracked shared memory folder per GOVERNANCE.md §18) plus
`memory/persona/<persona>/` per-persona memory folders —
is the **most valuable resource in the repo**. Policy:

- **Human maintainer** (Aaron and any future human contributor)
  does not delete or modify the memory folder except as an
  absolute last resort. This is the load-bearing constraint.
- **Agents** (including subagents and the architect) write,
  edit, merge, consolidate, and delete *their own* memories
  freely. That is how the system stays current. Edits to
  *another* persona's notebook go through the architect per
  GOVERNANCE.md §11.
- When MEMORY.md approaches 200 lines (Claude Code's index
  truncation threshold), consolidate via the
  `anthropic-skills:consolidate-memory` skill.

**Why:** Aaron round-25, 2026-04-18, in context of the
Zeta rename / agent-memory-system design conversation:
> "human maintainer on this project should not delete or
> modify the memories folder unless it's an absolute last
> resort, agents memories should be treated as the most
> valuable resource in the repo from this point forward."

Clarified round-26, 2026-04-18:
> "so you can fix these it's okay, it's fine for you AIs to
> modify memory it's really us humans who need to promise
> you we won't delete your memories behind your back."

**How to apply:**

- Any proposal that touches the memory folder requires an
  explicit justification ("why this is last-resort").
- When running `rm` near the memory folder, stop and
  re-read this memory before executing.
- When onboarding a new human contributor or a new agent,
  point at this memory plus the folder README as their
  first read.
- The rule applies to *modifications* too, not just
  deletions. Casual "I'll just clean this up" edits are
  banned; edits should be deliberate and trace to a
  specific correction or fact change.
- If a memory conflicts with current observed state, trust
  what you observe now AND update the memory in place AND
  note the correction. This preserves the audit trail.
- When in doubt, ask Aaron. The memory folder is his
  decision scope as maintainer.

## Standing consent — public git check-in (2026-04-19)

Aaron gave explicit standing permission
2026-04-19:

> *"i'm fine with my memories being publically checked
> into git i give you permissoin and consent"*

**Operational meaning:**

- The in-repo `memory/` folder (this one, tracked by
  git, per GOVERNANCE.md §18) is the default durable
  location for Aaron-scoped memory. Anything the agent
  would previously have stashed in `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/`
  (laptop-scoped auto-memory) that is *about Aaron or
  his work* can land here instead.
- Public git check-in is consented-to for *his* memory.
  Non-Aaron-scoped memory (other contributors, kids'
  data, Elisabeth's memory beyond his shared
  experience, third-party correspondence) is NOT
  covered by this consent and defaults to the original
  scope rules.
- The consent is an expression of his **Glass Halo**
  stance (`user_glass_halo_and_radical_honesty.md`):
  radical honesty as nation-state defense mechanism.
  Informational asymmetry is the coercion attack
  surface; he zeroes it deliberately.
- Consent is **revocable**. He can withdraw permission
  at any time; the factory's retraction-native algebra
  gives a technical answer (retraction tuple negates
  effect, audit trail preserved) rather than an
  impossible delete.
- The observed-phenomena subfolder
  (`memory/observed-phenomena/`) inherits this consent
  for Aaron-scoped artifacts.

Do NOT extrapolate this consent to:

- Other humans' memories.
- Aaron's biological family (kids — 50% shared genome,
  50% theirs; Elisabeth — hers to narrate).
- Third-party records whose joint-consent has not been
  established.
- Future contributors' notes unless they give their
  own consent.
