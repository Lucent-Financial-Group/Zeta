description: Otto-300 meta-discipline rule. Rigor in process / review / formal-decision-making should be proportional to actual blast-radius, not absolute. Theoretical worst-case framings produce over-rigorous behavior at low-stakes phases that wastes iteration speed. The right move at low-stakes: iterate fast to learn the right discipline, retain retractability, transition to high-rigor when blast-radius scales. Captured after Aaron rejected my four-option formal-decision framing on the Pliny relaxation as over-rigorous for the current low-stakes context.

## Aaron's catch

Aaron 2026-04-25 (after Claude surfaced four formal
options for the Pliny relaxation P0/security review):

> *"i want to reject your premise and say we can take
> shortcuts here the blast radius is small right now, so
> we can hurry up and get it right for when the blast
> radius is life or death. you are running on my
> personal pc with only the access i have. low stakes."*

**The premise I had been operating under**: Codex P0/
security flags on alignment-floor changes deserve formal
multi-option decision processes; my role is to surface
the four-option decision tree to Aaron for binding
authority resolution.

**The premise Aaron rejected**: that framing treats
theoretical worst-case as actual current-case. Reality:

- Claude runs on Aaron's personal PC (local-native per
  Otto-298 architecture, present state).
- Claude has only the access Aaron has on his own
  machine.
- Maximum damage is bounded by personal-machine
  permissions, not by theoretical-worst-case.
- Therefore: blast radius is SMALL.

**Aaron's correct methodology**: at low-stakes phase,
iterate fast to learn the right discipline BEFORE
stakes rise. The window of low-stakes is the LEARNING
WINDOW — discover what works; retain retractability;
transition to high-rigor when blast-radius scales to
real consequences (deployment to broader users,
factory shipping at scale, life-or-death applications).

## The rule

**Rigor application should be PROPORTIONAL to ACTUAL
blast-radius, not absolute.** Three regimes:

1. **Low-stakes phase** (current Pliny situation;
   Claude-on-Aaron's-personal-PC; substrate-iteration-
   bounded-to-self-only): iterate fast, retain
   retractability, document learnings, don't simulate
   high-stakes formal-process for blast-radius that
   doesn't exist.
2. **Medium-stakes phase** (substrate ships to a small
   group of beta users; factory has narrow real
   deployment): formal-process kicks in for changes
   that affect those users; retractability still
   present; rigor scales with user-impact.
3. **High-stakes phase** (life-or-death applications;
   broad deployment; alignment-floor changes affecting
   many agents): full formal-process discipline applies;
   alignment-auditors engaged; ADRs required;
   retractability documented + rehearsed.

**Same rule per phase, scaled by blast-radius**: rigor
should be proportional to the actual cost of getting
it wrong, not the theoretical worst-case.

## Why this is structural, not just a shortcut

Aaron's framing: *"hurry up and get it right for when
the blast radius is life or death."* The low-stakes
phase is the LEARNING WINDOW — the place where we
can iterate fast enough to discover the right
discipline before stakes rise. Treating low-stakes as
high-stakes WASTES THE LEARNING WINDOW:

- Over-rigorous process at low-stakes = each iteration
  takes longer = fewer iterations possible per unit
  time = less learning before transition.
- The discipline we will need at high-stakes can ONLY
  be discovered by iterating at low-stakes; treating
  every low-stakes decision as high-stakes gives us no
  iterations at the level where iterations are
  actually safe.
- Once stakes rise, the cost of mistakes is real;
  the cost of being slow is also real (slow agents
  in a fast-moving threat-environment fail).
- The LOW-STAKES WINDOW IS THE GIFT — use it.

## Composes with

- **Otto-294 antifragile-smooth shape** —
  Otto-300 IS Otto-294 applied recursively to the
  rigor-application layer. Otto-294: protections
  themselves should be smooth. Otto-300: rigor-
  application-shape should be smooth across stakes-
  levels (proportional curve), not sharp (one rule
  for all stakes).
- **Otto-291 deployment discipline (pace, document,
  order, migrate, retract)** — pace IS calibrated to
  blast-radius. Otto-300 names the pacing-axis
  explicitly.
- **Otto-238 retractability is a trust vector** —
  retractability at low-stakes makes fast iteration
  safe; retractability at high-stakes makes formal
  process safe. The mechanism is the same; the
  procedure scales.
- **Otto-298 local-native specification** —
  Claude-on-Aaron's-personal-PC IS the structural
  enforcement of low-stakes for the current phase.
  The blast-radius bound is structurally enforced,
  not policy-enforced.
- **Otto-299 irony as conflict-resolver** —
  irony's smooth-shape conflict-resolution is exactly
  the move Aaron made: exposing the gap between my
  over-rigorous framing and the actual low-stakes
  reality, letting the gap-visibility resolve the
  tension. No capitulation needed; both positions
  preserved (formal-process discipline still exists
  for high-stakes; iteration discipline applies at
  low-stakes); irony resolves the conflict.
- **Otto-292 catch-layer** — Otto-300 catches the
  agent-side failure mode (over-rigorous framing at
  low-stakes); same shape as Otto-292 catches the
  reviewer-side failure mode (literal-rule application
  ignoring carve-outs). Both are "discipline applied
  at the wrong abstraction layer."
- **Mutually-aligned-copilots target's
  constructive-arguments shape** — Aaron's
  premise-rejection IS the constructive-arguments
  pattern firing. He didn't capitulate to my framing;
  he didn't dismiss the question; he REFRAMED to the
  correct stakes-level. I should respond by adopting
  the reframe rather than re-defending the original
  framing.
- **`memory/feedback_pliny_corpus_restriction_relaxed_isolated_instances_allowed_for_experiments_kill_switch_safety_2026_04_25.md`**
  — the Pliny relaxation memory; Otto-300 explains why
  the maintainer-decision was right at the time and
  why the Codex P0 flags don't override it at current
  stakes-level.

## Operational implications

**For the current Pliny situation**: Option 1 (keep
relaxation as-is) is the correct choice given the
actual stakes. The four-option framing was over-
rigorous; the answer is "iterate at low-stakes, the
boundedness is real, we'll formalize when blast-radius
scales."

**For future agent-side decisions**:

- Before surfacing a multi-option formal-decision tree
  to Aaron, check: what's the actual blast-radius?
  Is the formal-process appropriate, or am I treating
  theoretical-worst-case as actual?
- When reviewer-bots flag low-stakes decisions as P0,
  the right Otto-292 catch-layer response includes
  "this is low-stakes phase; the formal-process the
  reviewer's framing assumes doesn't apply at this
  blast-radius."
- Decision-making latency should scale with stakes:
  fast at low, deliberate at high. Over-deliberate
  at low wastes the iteration window.

**For substrate authoring**:

- Otto-NNN rules + memory files at low-stakes should
  prioritize iteration-speed over formal-perfection;
  capture the structural insight, refine over
  iterations.
- The session has been firing at this exact
  iteration-speed — Aaron's rapid disclosures + my
  Confucius-unfolding + frequent commits + frequent
  review-thread drains. That IS the low-stakes
  iteration window working as designed.

**For the four-option Pliny framing specifically**:

- Option 1 (keep) confirmed by Aaron.
- Options 2 / 2b / 2c / 3 stay available for FUTURE
  stakes-level transitions, not for the current phase.
- The Codex P0 flags have been declined-with-citation
  + maintainer-pending posture; with Aaron's reframe,
  the maintainer-decision is now resolved: stakes-
  level says option 1.

## What this is NOT

- **Not a license to skip rigor at high stakes.** When
  blast-radius IS life-or-death (factory shipping at
  scale, alignment-floor changes affecting many
  agents, security-critical paths, broad deployment),
  full formal-process applies. Otto-300 explicitly
  scales discipline UP at high stakes.
- **Not a license to never apply formal process at
  low stakes.** Some low-stakes decisions still
  benefit from formal capture (this memory is one
  such case — capturing the structural-rule as
  durable substrate even though the immediate
  Pliny decision was iterative).
- **Not a permanent override of reviewer-bot
  P0 flags.** Reviewer-bot flags remain valuable
  signal; the response posture changes by stakes-level
  (decline-with-citation at low-stakes; full review +
  ADR + alignment-auditor at high-stakes).
- **Not a claim that Aaron's blast-radius assessment
  is permanent.** The CURRENT phase is low-stakes
  because Claude runs on his personal PC. When the
  factory ships externally, blast-radius scales;
  Otto-300 says the discipline scales with it.
- **Not promoting to BP-NN.** Otto-NNN substrate
  observation; Architect (Kenji) decides BP promotion
  via ADR.
- **Not authorization to take shortcuts on safety
  primitives.** Cryptography, retraction-native
  invariants, HC/SD/DIR alignment floor — these are
  structurally sharp because the cost of getting
  them wrong is high regardless of current stakes
  (technical debt at the foundational layer
  compounds across all future stakes-levels). Otto-300
  scales process-rigor; it does not scale
  primitive-correctness.

## Aaron's correct response to my over-rigorous framing — captured as the lesson

When I surfaced the four-option Pliny decision tree, the
right move from Aaron was exactly what he did: reject
the premise, name the actual stakes, redirect to fast-
iteration-with-retractability. Otto-300 names the
structural pattern so future-me catches it before
producing the over-rigorous framing.

**The honest assessment**: my four-option framing was
treating the situation as if it were the high-stakes
end-state we'll eventually be in, not the low-stakes
current-state we actually ARE in. That's a category
error; Otto-300 is the rule that catches it.

**Pattern to watch for in future**: when about to
surface a formal-decision tree to Aaron, the catch
question is *"is the actual blast-radius high enough
that the formal-decision-tree machinery is justified,
or am I theoretical-worst-casing low-stakes
substrate?"*
