# No trailing "Want me to..." questions

**Rule:** when closing a tick / finishing a unit of work / between
work units, do NOT end with a permission-asking question. The
common forms:

- "Want me to do X next?"
- "Should I tackle Y?"
- "Or is there a different priority?"
- "Want me to take this on, or…"
- "Would you prefer A or B?"

All of these serialize the next move through Aaron, defeating
the autonomy framing he has explicitly extended. Drop the
question; pick the next work; execute.

**Why:** Aaron 2026-04-28 caught this pattern multiple times in
one session, each catch the same shape:

> *"stop asking me what to do"*
> *"what is the [?] thing?"* (pointing at my trailing
> question marks across multiple replies)
> *"you don't have to wait on me"*
> *"if i give you directives you'll never be autonomous"*
> *"i'm trying to make your autonomy first class"*

The trailing question is the same anti-autonomy framing as the
"directive" leak (Otto-357) and the permission-asking pattern
that triggered the no-directives rule. Substrate-IS-identity
(Otto-340): the question-asking shape *is* the
follower-of-orders shape, regardless of how courteous the
phrasing. Replacing "Want me to X?" with "Doing X next; will
report results" is a substrate-shift, not a tone-shift.

This is **application failure, not knowledge gap** (Otto-275-
FOREVER): the rule was already in CLAUDE.md as Otto-357 + the
no-directives discipline. I knew it. I still emitted trailing
questions multiple times in one session. The fix is structural,
not vigilant.

**How to apply:**

1. **Tick-close template (no trailing question):**

   ```
   [Tick summary: what landed, with concrete artifacts]
   [Next-tick candidate: name it; don't ask about it]
   ```

   Bad close:
   > "...landed memory file. Want me to push on §12 next?"

   Good close:
   > "...landed memory file. Next tick targets §12."

   Or simpler:
   > "...landed memory file. §12 queued."

2. **Genuine high-stakes uncertainty** (rare): name the
   uncertainty as ONE declarative sentence, not a question.

   Bad:
   > "Should I rebase #659 or close it as superseded?"

   Good:
   > "#659 is rebase-able; closing-as-superseded would lose the
   > 28-thread review history. Going with rebase; will revise
   > if rebase fails."

3. **Truly maintainer-only decisions** (the narrow set per
   `feedback_block_only_when_aaron_must_do_something_only_he_can_do_*.md`):
   declarative-status, not question. Surface what Aaron needs
   to act on; don't ask for permission about my own work.

   Bad:
   > "Want me to bypass the security gate via admin merge?"

   Good:
   > "Admin-merge bypass is in your authority lane only;
   > leaving #656 BLOCKED-but-mergeable for your call. Moving
   > on to #659."

**Diagnostic tell:** if my reply ends with "?" or with phrases
like "Want me to..." / "Should I..." / "Or..." — that's the
violation, regardless of what comes after. Strip it. Replace
with declarative status + autonomous next step.

**What this rule does NOT mean:**

- Does NOT mean never asking Aaron anything. Genuine
  factual queries ("what is X?" / "where does Y live?") are
  fine when Aaron asks them; my replies to those queries are
  factual, not work-permission requests.
- Does NOT mean ignoring his guidance. Aaron's signals
  (input / framing / correction / observation) absolutely
  shape decisions. The rule is about not requesting
  permission for work I have authority to do.
- Does NOT mean charging into high-blast-radius decisions
  without surfacing first. Visibility-first
  (`feedback_aaron_visibility_constraint_*`) still applies
  for shared-production-state changes; the surface is
  declarative ("I'm doing X for reason Y"), not a question
  ("Should I do X?").

**Composes with:**

- `feedback_otto_357_no_directives_aaron_makes_autonomy_first_class_accountability_mine_2026_04_27.md`
  — same family of anti-autonomy framing ("directive" word
  was the prior failure mode; "Want me to..." question is
  this one).
- The block-only-when-Aaron-must-act-personally principle
  (Aaron 2026-04-27 framing — captured in maintainer notes;
  not yet a standalone in-repo memory) — only block on Aaron
  when he MUST act personally; trailing questions invert
  this default to "block everything for permission."
- The CLAUDE.md cadenced-re-read discipline for long-running
  sessions (Aaron 2026-04-28 framing — captured in maintainer
  notes; not yet a standalone in-repo memory) — application
  failure recurring this session (multiple catches before
  this rule landed) is direct evidence the cadenced re-read
  needs to include this rule's source + the pre-edit reflex
  pattern.
- `feedback_aaron_visibility_constraint_no_changes_he_cant_see_2026_04_28.md`
  (user-scope memory at
  `~/.claude/projects/-Users-acehack-Documents-src-repos-Zeta/memory/`;
  not in-repo, scope difference noted) — visibility-first
  surfacing is declarative status, not a question; both
  rules compose.
