name: DST is the empirical quality justification for TS-over-bash; vibe-coders always have a harness so harness hooks suffice and git hooks are unnecessary (Aaron 2026-05-03)
description: 2026-05-03; Aaron-named two architectural justifications.

(2) Vibe-coders are never without a harness of some kind (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc.); harnesses provide TS runtime (bun) → harness hooks suffice for skill-bundle distribution → git hooks are unnecessary.

# DST justifies TS-over-bash + harness hooks suffice (no git hooks needed)

## Origin

Aaron 2026-05-03, in autonomous-loop maintainer channel after Otto observed a TS-vs-bash generator divergence on docs/BACKLOG.md (the bash generator and TS generator produced slightly different output; CI used bash, so the TS-generated output failed the drift check):

> *"to back up my bash is lower quality claim i offer the difficlut of proper Deterministic Simulation in bash vs ts, this is where my quality assesment comes from. i don't think we need git hooks harness hooks are good vibe coders will never be without a harness of some kind"*

Plus same-message-cluster affirmations:

> *"ts is great"*

> *"that's aweseom"*

This memo captures two architectural insights from the exchange.

## Insight 1 — DST is the empirical quality justification for TS-over-bash

The TS-over-bash quality preference isn't a stylistic preference. It's grounded in **Deterministic Simulation Testing** capability:

- TS supports proper DST: typed inputs, deterministic outputs, controlled randomness via seed-injection, mockable I/O, structured assertions
- Bash supports DST poorly: weakly typed (everything is a string), output depends on environment + locale + shell version + filesystem state, randomness is hard to control, mocking I/O requires PATH games or wrapper scripts, assertions are typically `[ "$x" = "$y" ]` with no structured failure messages

This is **empirical, testable substrate-quality grounding**, not just a preference. The DST capability difference is the principled reason TS is canonical and bash is exceptional.

Composes with:

- **Otto-272 DST-everywhere** — DST is the universal testing discipline; TS supports it; bash doesn't
- **B-0156 TS standardization** — port every .sh outside install graph + every .py to TS. The DST justification is the architectural rationale
- **The 4-shell bash-compatibility target (Otto-235)** — narrowed to: bash exists ONLY where DST isn't required (pre-install scripts before bun is available)

## Insight 2 — vibe-coders always have a harness; harness hooks suffice (git hooks are antipattern)

Aaron 2026-05-03: *"vibe coders will never be without a harness of some kind"* + *"i don't think we need git hooks harness hooks are good"* + *"many consider git hooks an antipatter, i tend to love antipattern when they are used in the non antipatter way lol, i dont know if we have any non antipatter use cases that harness hook counld not handle but git hooks could."*.

**The antipattern argument**: many consider git hooks an antipattern because they (a) tie repo policy to client-side configuration that's easily bypassed, (b) require platform-specific scripts (bash + ps1 + shebangs), (c) silently fail when missing or misconfigured, (d) don't compose with modern agentic-engineering workflows.

**Non-antipattern use cases for git hooks that harness hooks can't handle** (analyzed for completeness):

1. **Server-side hooks** (pre-receive, post-receive on the git server) — enforce policy on a SHARED repo regardless of client. Useful when contributors might bypass client-side validation
2. **Protecting against non-harness commits** — if any contributor commits via terminal/standalone-client without a harness, git hooks catch what harness hooks miss

**Why these don't apply to Zeta**:

- Server-side hooks are useful for repos with adversarial / non-aligned contributors. Zeta's vibe-coded scope assumes harness-mediated contributors only
- Non-harness commits are anti-vibe-coded by definition; protecting against them optimizes for a case Zeta isn't designed for

**Conclusion**: Zeta has NO non-antipattern git-hook use case. B-0173 should be harness hooks + CI only.

Architectural simplification for B-0173 (hook authoring) and skill-bundle distribution (B-0172):

- **Vibe-coders always have at least one harness** (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Aider, Gemini-CLI, etc.)
- **Harnesses provide TS runtime** (bun, node, etc.) as part of their installation
- **Skill-bundle users get TS-ready environment by default**
- **Harness hooks** (e.g., Claude Code's `.claude/settings.json` hooks field) execute commands in the harness's runtime → can call TS directly

Therefore: **git hooks are unnecessary for skill-bundle distribution**. B-0173's scope simplifies to:

1. ~~`tools/git/hooks/pre-commit`~~ — REMOVED. Not needed; harness hooks cover the use case
2. ~~`tools/git/hooks/commit-msg`~~ — REMOVED. Same
3. **Harness hooks** (Claude Code `.claude/settings.json` hooks, Codex equivalent) — call `bun tools/substrate-claim-checker/check-counts.ts` or similar
4. **CI check on PR descriptions** (`.github/workflows/substrate-claim-checker.yml`) — still in scope; runs on the host

The **B-0173 ground-truth-recovery (PR #1280)** was WRONG when it listed 3 hook types including git hooks. The correct scope is harness hooks + CI only. This memo's filing initiates the correction.

Composes with:

- **B-0173** (hook authoring) — scope simplified
- **B-0172** (skill-domain plugin packaging) — packaging is harness-bundle-shaped; user always has harness
- **Cross-disciplinary pattern adoption memo** — Aaron applies DbC (Eiffel/Meyer) at the harness-hook layer, NOT git hook layer
- **Karpathy edge-runner framing** — vibe-coders are agentic-engineering users; agentic-engineering means harness-mediated; harness-mediated means runtime-available

## Pre-existing wrong substrate to correct

The B-0173 ground-truth-recovery section in `memory/architectural-intent-guesses/2026-05-03-b-0173-hook-authoring-for-skill-creation-contracts.md` (lines 116-118) has:

```
1. tools/git/hooks/pre-commit (proposed)
2. tools/git/hooks/commit-msg (proposed)
3. .github/workflows/substrate-claim-checker.yml (proposed)
```

Per Aaron 2026-05-03, items #1 and #2 are no longer in scope. Only #3 (CI) and a new #4 (harness hooks per Claude Code's `.claude/settings.json`) are in scope.

The correction lands in a separate PR; this memo is the substrate that justifies it.

## Future-Otto rules

1. **TS is canonical**; bash exists ONLY for pre-install scripts (where DST is unavailable anyway). When in doubt: TS
2. **Harness hooks are the distribution mechanism for skill-bundle users**; git hooks are NOT needed because vibe-coders always have a harness
3. **DST is the empirical quality justification** for the TS-canonical preference. When justifying TS over bash, cite DST capability — that's stronger than "bash is just lower quality"
4. **Skill-bundle distribution flows through harnesses** — CC plugins, Codex equivalents, Cursor, etc. The substrate doesn't go directly to user filesystem; it goes through the harness's plugin system

## Composes with

- `memory/feedback_skills_as_carved_sentences_knowledge_in_docs_datavault_2_0_pattern_aaron_2026_05_03.md` — skill-design rule 2 (no dynamic commands; use TS files)
- `memory/feedback_cross_disciplinary_pattern_adoption_aaron_thinking_style_dataVault_at_skill_level_2026_05_03.md` — Aaron's cross-disciplinary pattern adoption (DbC at harness-hook layer)
- B-0173 (hook authoring) — scope simplification per this memo
- B-0172 (skill-domain plugin packaging) — distribution mechanism per this memo
- B-0156 (TS standardization) — DST is the architectural rationale
- Otto-272 DST-everywhere — the empirical quality property TS provides and bash doesn't
- Otto-235 (bash compatibility 4-shell target) — narrows to "bash for pre-install only"
- AGENTS.md "The vibe-coded hypothesis" — vibe-coding is agentic-engineering = harness-mediated by definition

## Carved sentence

**"DST capability is the empirical quality justification for TS-over-bash: proper Deterministic Simulation is much harder in bash than TS. Vibe-coders are never without a harness; harness hooks suffice for skill-bundle distribution; git hooks are unnecessary. B-0173 scope simplifies to harness hooks + CI only (no git hooks). Bash exists in Zeta ONLY for pre-install scripts where DST is unavailable anyway. When justifying TS over bash, cite DST capability — that's stronger than 'bash is just lower quality.'"**
