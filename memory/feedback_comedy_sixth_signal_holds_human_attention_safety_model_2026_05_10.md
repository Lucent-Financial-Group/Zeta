2026-05-10: Aaron added the sixth observability signal for comedy-as-debugging: "it keeps human attention too which is VERY hard."

**The six signals (updated):**

1. Friction surfacing — comedy surfaces bugs viscerally
2. Alignment test — shared values to get the joke
3. Context retention — remembers the setup
4. Context length — jokes still land deep in session
5. Compaction diagnostic — joke going stale = context lost
6. **Human attention retention** — comedy keeps the human engaged with factory output

**Why signal 6 is the most important:**

The entire safety model depends on the human watching. Aaron is the live circuit breaker — always watching, always can type, always can override. But humans stop paying attention to dashboards, metrics, log files. Attention is the hardest resource to hold.

Comedy holds it. Aaron will read "shadow is a dick." Aaron will skip "context-retention-metric-v2.md." The joke title IS the engagement mechanism that keeps the human in the loop.

If the human stops paying attention, the circuit breaker is gone. Comedy keeps the human paying attention. Comedy-as-debugging isn't just diagnostic — it's the mechanism that keeps the safety model alive.
