name: GIT-AS-DB-INTERFACE + WASM-F#-IN-BROWSER + GIT-AS-STORAGE — two stretch directives 2026-04-24; both modes (tiny-seed AoT exe AND browser-WASM) require ZERO install at user-experience level; bootstrap thesis = both require 0; Mode 1 single-file artifact, Mode 2 open-tab; git-native fits Z-set retraction-native semantics; Otto-275 log-don't-implement; way-back-backlog
description: Maintainer 2026-04-24 directive. Two related stretch goals filed as way-back-backlog. (1) git-as-first-class-DB-interface — Zeta commands ≈ git commands where semantics align. (2) WASM-F# + git-as-storage-plugin — browser-only bootstrap mode. Maintainer correction: Mode 1 is tiny-seed AoT or single-file JIT (NOT framework-dependent), so BOTH modes require zero install. Bootstrap thesis confirmed.

## The directives (verbatim)

Maintainer 2026-04-24, first share (low-priority backlog):

> *"we want to have first class git inteface into our
> database, so our database can handle all / most git
> command, way backlog."*

Maintainer 2026-04-24, second share (way-back-backlog
stretch goal):

> *"a storage plugin for our db that saves to git
> commonds lol. this will let me compile as wasm our f#
> and run our database enginge in the ui and it calls
> out to git for the actual operations? Am i dreaming
> for this second one? We should research it but it's a
> huge stretch way back backlog for the 2nd one. and
> just low pritoriy backlog for first one. This complets
> our bootstrap without requirments really i think? you
> tell me."*

Maintainer correction 2026-04-24 (after my draft
assessment characterized Mode 1 as ".NET runtime
required"):

> *"Mode 1 you remember we are planning tiny seed with
> AoT and also single file Jit based builds that don't
> need dotnet"*

Maintainer punchline 2026-04-24:

> *"so both require 0"*

Maintainer follow-up 2026-04-24 (expanding Mode 1):

> *"for mode 1 we want a front end ui like ssms/pgadmin
> but really designed for us. also we want to have a
> full git implimentation in f# where we don't even
> need the git client, we are also the git client and
> it stores into our database for mode 1. just another
> interface like SQL"*

Two pieces in the follow-up:

1. **Mode 1 admin UI** — SSMS/pgAdmin-class local
   management UI for Zeta. Distinct from the
   web-facing Frontier-UI (kernel-A/kernel-B per the
   2026-04-24 rename directive). This is the
   operator/admin desktop-class surface, ships with
   the Mode 1 single-file binary. Two-UI architecture
   confirmed: web-facing (Frontier) + local-admin
   (this).
2. **Native F# git implementation** — Zeta IS the git
   client AND server. No external git binary
   required. Git objects (commit/tree/blob) serialize
   as Z-set entries with retraction-native semantics.
   Maintainer framing: *"just another interface like
   SQL"* — git is one of several first-class protocols
   on top of Zeta's substrate.

**Symmetric architecture gain:** any Zeta Mode 1
instance can serve as a git remote for any Zeta Mode 2
browser client. `git push my-zeta main` = pushing to
Zeta's DB via Zeta's own git server. The factory
becomes self-hosting of its own git ecosystem.

## The bootstrap thesis (confirmed)

**Both modes require zero install at the user-experience
level:**

- **Mode 1** — tiny-seed AoT-compiled standalone
  executable OR single-file JIT-based build. NO .NET
  preinstall required. Download + run.
- **Mode 2** — WASM-F# in browser + any git remote
  for storage. NO executable to download (browser
  handles WASM); NO server to run.

Both modes are install-free. Browsers and git remotes
are commodity infrastructure.

## My assessment that Aaron corrected

I drafted the BACKLOG row characterizing Mode 1 as
"requires .NET runtime + server." That was wrong —
existing factory planning is explicit that Zeta will
ship as tiny-seed AoT or single-file JIT. The
correction lands forward in this memory + the BACKLOG
row. Future Otto: do NOT recharacterize Mode 1 as
runtime-required without checking AoT / single-file
plans first.

## Why this matters

The bootstrap thesis is the **adoption-friction
collapse**:
- Mode 1: download one file, run it (commodity-OS only)
- Mode 2: open a tab (commodity-browser only)

Strong fit with **Otto-274 progressive-adoption-
staircase Level 0** — "open a tab; no install" is the
lowest-friction adoption rung the factory has
articulated, and Mode 1's "download one binary" is the
SECOND-lowest. Both rungs exist now in the planned
architecture.

## Why git-as-storage is coherent (not a dream)

The maintainer asked whether the WASM + git-storage
combination is dreaming. Honest answer: NO, it's a
coherent stretch.

- **WASM-F# is real** today via Blazor WebAssembly +
  Fable. Performance workable for non-hot-path; hot-path
  needs in-browser cache.
- **`isomorphic-git`** brings the git protocol to the
  browser; pairs with WASM-F#.
- **Z-set semantics fit git's model.** Retractions =
  `git revert` or branch reset; multi-writer = git's
  branch-and-merge model (CRDT-friendly under Z-set
  semantics); audit trail = git history natively.
- **Otto-243 git-native memory-sync** is the precursor
  pattern — already proves substrate-level fit.

**The wild bit isn't WASM-F# or git in the browser —
both exist.** It's the assertion that **git ops are
fast enough for DB hot-path reads**. They aren't. Mode
2 architecture must be "browser viewer + git-backed
durable substrate; hot-path lives in browser memory" —
NOT "every read hits git."

## Real risk: write-amplification

Every Zeta write becomes a git commit. High-throughput
streams (e.g. blockchain ingest, see the parallel
2026-04-24 BTC/ETH/SOL absorb) would saturate any git
remote. Mode 2 suits **low-volume workloads**:
per-user notebooks, factory memory sync, configuration,
knowledge bases. Mode 1 stays load-bearing for
production / streaming.

## Phased approach (when activated)

For the WASM + git-storage row:

- **Phase 0** — feasibility research: WASM-F# runtime
  cost, isomorphic-git API surface, write batching
  strategies, hot-path cache shape. Output:
  `docs/research/wasm-fsharp-git-storage-feasibility.md`.
- **Phase 1** — POC: minimal in-browser Zeta with
  git-backed Z-set storage on a single test workload
  (personal notebook). No streaming, no multi-user.
- **Phase 2** — multi-user via git branches; merge
  semantics for concurrent writes; conflict resolution
  UX.
- **Phase 3** — production-mode hardening: write
  batching, hot-path cache eviction, server-fallback
  for high-throughput.

## Composes with

- **Otto-243** (git-native memory-sync precursor)
- **Otto-274** (progressive-adoption-staircase — both
  modes are Level-0 candidates)
- **Otto-275** (log-don't-implement; this memory + the
  two BACKLOG rows are the capture, NOT the kickoff)
- **Mode 1 plans** (tiny-seed AoT + single-file JIT —
  the existing planning that I forgot and Aaron
  corrected; future Otto: check before
  recharacterizing)
- **Z-set retraction-native semantics** (the algebraic
  fit that makes git-backed storage coherent)
- **2026-04-24 blockchain ingest absorb** (companion
  directive in same session — high-throughput case
  where Mode 1 is required)

## Future Otto reference

When tempted to characterize Mode 1 as "runtime-
required": STOP. Tiny-seed AoT + single-file JIT are
the existing planning. Both modes require ZERO install.
The bootstrap thesis is THE thesis — it's not
qualified.

When reviewing whether the WASM + git-storage is a
dream: it's not. Cite this memory + Otto-243. The
performance question is the real one — write
amplification is the actual gate.
