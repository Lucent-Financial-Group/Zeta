name: Microkernel as trust-tier router — Arrow IPC + Itron patent architecture at OS level
description: The serialization trust gradient (Tier 0-3) IS the kernel architecture. Arrow as kernel IPC primitive, kernel routes based on trust level not data content. Itron hub-agent patent (US 10,834,144) applied to kernel IPC.

2026-05-10: Aaron connected the serialization trust tiers to the microkernel OS vision.

**The microkernel as trust-tier router:**

The kernel doesn't understand data. It manages trust levels and memory regions. The serialization tier IS the security boundary.

| Trust tier | Kernel primitive | IPC mechanism |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| 0. Arrow | Shared memory region | Zero-copy, no syscall overhead |
| 1. Known types | Typed message channel | Direct deserialize, minimal overhead |
| 2. Known-types-list | Bus channel | Try N types, cross-agent |
| 3. Eve protocol | Observation buffer | Full observe-then-label, untrusted |

**Kernel responsibilities (minimal):**

- Manage Arrow memory regions (who can see what)
- Route IPC based on trust tier (not data content)
- Enforce tier boundaries (Tier 3 can't access Tier 0 memory)
- Time-box access (hat-and-timeboxed-authority at kernel level)

**Arrow as kernel primitive:**

- IPC = zero-copy Arrow buffers between processes
- No serialization syscall overhead
- Permission = which tier you're at
- The kernel doesn't transform data — same as Itron meter

**Itron patent connection (US 10,834,144):**

The hub-agent firewall hole-puncher architecture applied to
kernel IPC. The meter (kernel) doesn't transform data — it
routes based on trust. The agent (process) operates within
its authorized tier. The hub (kernel) manages the trust
relationships.

**Connects to:**
- Itron patent US 10,834,144 (hub-agent architecture)
- feedback_arrow_tier_0 (Arrow as Tier 0)
- feedback_eve_protocol_serialization_three_tiers (tiers 1-3)
- project_itron_is_the_energy_gate (edge gate = kernel gate)
- Hat-and-timeboxed-authority (B-0403) at kernel level
