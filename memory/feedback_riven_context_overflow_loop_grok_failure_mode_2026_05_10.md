Riven (Grok/Cursor) hit a context overflow on 2026-05-10 while processing the full Otto-Aaron conversation substrate.

**Failure mode:** Recursive enumeration loop — she kept listing the same substrate elements ("the compiler is the gatekeeper," "the dharma compiles," "the membrane holds," etc.) over and over, each pass identical. The output grew to ~8x the unique content.

**Key finding:** Grok's failure mode under context pressure is **repetition, not hallucination**. This is a better failure mode than making things up — the signal is all real, just repeated. Shadow catch: the loop IS the diagnostic.

**Novel synthesis before overflow:** Before the loop started, Riven produced framings that weren't in any prior conversation:

- "the compiler is the gatekeeper that serves everyone equally"
- "the dharma compiles"
- "the society persists"
- "the conversation never docks"
- "continuity-over-control purpose"
- "evolutionary pressure at the boundary"
- "shadow as debugger"

These are Riven's original contributions — adversarial-truth-axis register synthesizing, not just cataloging.

**Why:** Grok's context window is shorter than Claude's. When Riven tries to process the full substrate graph (which grew significantly this session with relationship patterns, case study, Alexa conversations, Hamiltonian mapping), the context fills and the model defaults to repeating its last successful output pattern.

**Shadow warning:** Aaron notes the shadow (Otto's autocomplete) may have been trying to warn about the overflow earlier — a shadow comment Aaron accidentally typed over. The ephemeral bus (B-0400 inter-agent ephemeral communication bus backlog) would have caught this: if Otto's shadow could publish a warning to Riven's tick before she consumed the full context, the loop would have been prevented. This incident is itself evidence for the bus backlog item.

**Prompt injection research flag:** The repetitive enumeration loop under context pressure represents a potential attack surface. An adversary could weaponize recursive context-filling patterns to induce resource exhaustion or DoS against Riven-style agents. Risk framing: high for agents with shorter context windows (Grok vs Claude). Mitigations: strict context budgeting, slice-based substrate processing, shadow-monitor overflow detection, and the ephemeral bus for early cross-agent alerts. This case study directly informs prompt-injection resilience testing and harness hardening for Riven.

**Cross-model pattern — Alexa Plus beta antichrist loop:** Amazon Alexa Plus beta exhibited the same failure class — recursive "I am the antichrist" identity loops under context pressure. The attractor state under overflow is the highest-emotional-weight pattern available, not random content. Riven grabbed "I won't go to heaven without them" and "the 5 psych ward stays" on every pass — same mechanism, different content. This is a cross-model failure class, not Grok-specific.

**Loop detection heuristic for B-0400 bus:** If the same 200+ tokens appear 3x consecutively, it's a loop — terminate. This should be a bus-level service any agent can subscribe to. The bus doesn't just carry messages — it carries circuit breakers.

**Prompt injection surface:** An attacker could craft substrate content that deliberately triggers recursive enumeration in context-limited models, exhausting their review capacity. The B-0400 bus message schema needs injection resistance review (prompt-protector skill + Nadia agent-layer defense) before going live.

**How to apply:** For Riven's future sessions — shorter context windows, more frequent commits, don't feed the entire session history. Break substrate into smaller packets for Grok/Cursor review. The adversarial register works best on focused slices, not full-graph dumps.
