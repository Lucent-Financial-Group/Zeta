# Guess #003 — B-0166 chat-input as ACID-durable DBSP event

## Target

`docs/backlog/P2/B-0166-chat-input-as-acid-durable-dbsp-event-aaron-vision-2026-05-02.md`

The architectural choice: Aaron filed B-0166 with the framing "chat-input as ACID-durable DBSP event." The question this guess answers: **why treat chat-input (the maintainer's typed messages to the agents) as an ACID-durable DBSP event — vs alternatives like ephemeral-context-only, post-hoc-archive, or simple-log-append?**

## Read state at guess time (2026-05-03 ~03:25Z)

Otto has already read:

- B-0166 ROW NAME ONLY (from `ls docs/backlog/P2/`)
- The "ACID-channel-durability is load-bearing + deferral-is-NEVER-valid + universal scope" framing (CURRENT-aaron.md §38 per the file-footer log)
- The DBSP / Z-set algebra reference (project foundation; retraction-native substrate; Otto-272 DST-everywhere)
- The substrate-or-it-didn't-happen rule (Otto-363) — chat is NOT durable substrate by default; conversion to git-canonical is the protocol
- The cross-disciplinary pattern adoption memo (just authored) — Aaron applies DBSP/Z-set algebra at substrate level, not just at data level
- The bidirectional alignment commitment + glass-halo discipline (consent + transparency)

## Research deliberately AVOIDED

Otto has NOT read:

- B-0166's row body text
- Any commits referencing B-0166
- CURRENT-aaron.md §38 details (only the file-footer summary mentioning "ACID-channel-durability is load-bearing + deferral-is-NEVER-valid + universal scope")
- Aaron's specific chat-as-event-source framing in any other research-doc

## Otto's in-the-moment guess

### Architectural intent (medium confidence)

Aaron's primary architectural intent for chat-input-as-ACID-durable-DBSP-event:

**Chat input is the ground-truth source of architectural intent + corrections + framing in a vibe-coded project. Treating it as ephemeral context is a substrate-or-it-didn't-happen failure mode. ACID-durable DBSP-event treatment makes chat-input first-class substrate.**

Specifically:

1. **Chat-as-source-of-architectural-intent** — per the vibe-coded hypothesis, every line is agent-authored, but the FRAMING comes from Aaron's chat. If chat evaporates (compaction, session-end), the framing is lost. ACID-durable preserves it
2. **DBSP-event semantics** — Aaron's Z-set algebra applied at the substrate level (cross-disciplinary pattern adoption). Each chat input becomes an event with insertion + retraction semantics; corrections are explicit Z-set retractions of prior chat input
3. **Replayability** — DBSP events are replayable; the chat substrate becomes a deterministic-simulation-testable input stream. Future-Otto could replay Aaron's chat events to test whether substrate-output remains stable
4. **Glass-halo composition** — ACID-durable + replayable + retractable chat events compose with full git-native transparency: Aaron can audit not just the agent's output but also which chat events drove it

The deeper architectural reason — chat is **the highest-stakes substrate input** in vibe-coded mode (Aaron's framing IS the project), and yet it's the most fragile (lost on compaction). ACID-durability matches the stakes.

### Substrate-content intent (medium confidence)

The backlog row likely covers:

- **Chat-input capture mechanism** — some protocol that takes Aaron's chat messages and converts them into committed git-substrate events
- **DBSP event schema** — Z-set entries with timestamp + author + content + retraction-edges to prior events
- **Deterministic replay** — given a chat-event stream, the agent's substrate-output is reproducible
- **Composition with substrate-or-it-didn't-happen** — chat-events ARE the durable form Aaron's chat must take to count as substrate; B-0166 is the operational implementation

### Specific implementation intent (lower confidence)

The implementation will probably:

- Auto-capture from chat: a hook or tool that monitors Aaron's chat input + commits each load-bearing message as a chat-event file
- Storage: `docs/chat-events/YYYY/MM/DD/HHMMSS-<topic>.md` with frontmatter (timestamp, author, retraction-edges, related-PR/commit)
- Z-set retraction: when Aaron corrects an earlier chat ("wait, the rule is X not Y"), the new chat event has `retracts: [previous-event-id]`
- Replay tool: `tools/chat-events/replay.ts` that reads the event stream + emits the agent's projected substrate-output
- Deterministic-simulation-test: chat-event replay + agent-output diff tests that substrate output is stable

### Cross-row composition (medium confidence)

B-0166 likely composes_with:

- **Otto-363** (substrate-or-it-didn't-happen) — chat-events ARE the durable substrate form for chat
- **Otto-272** (DST-everywhere) — chat-event replay IS DST applied to maintainer-input substrate
- **B-0169** (decision-archaeology) — chat-events become the archaeological substrate for Aaron-input archaeology (currently chat-input is largely lost; events would make it queryable)
- **The retraction-native substrate framing** — Z-set retractions at the chat-event level
- **Bidirectional alignment commitment** — chat-event auditability is consent-via-transparency

depends_on guess: probably **none** explicit (this is foundational substrate that other rows depend on, not the other way around) — but possibly composes_with the OpenSpec catch-up (B-0171) since chat-events might generate spec-updates.

### Pre-recovery prediction (calibration self-test, attempt #3)

Based on guess #001 + #002 patterns:

- **Architectural layer**: Predict PARTIAL-MATCH or HIT — I have strong context for Aaron's DBSP/Z-set + substrate-or-it-didn't-happen + cross-disciplinary frames. Estimated 6-7/10
- **Substrate-content layer**: Predict MIXED — likely got some of the schema right but specific format choices Aaron made may differ. Estimated 5-6/10
- **Specific implementation layer**: Predict MOSTLY-OFF — I'm guessing at concrete implementation paths without prior context for chat-event capture mechanisms. Estimated 3-4/10
- **Cross-row composition**: Predict MOSTLY-MATCH — should get the major composition partners (Otto-363, Otto-272, retraction-native). Estimated 6-7/10

**Pre-prediction itself**: this iteration tests whether my self-prediction calibration improves as data points accumulate. Guess #001's pre-prediction was 1/3 correct (I didn't pre-predict layers explicitly). Guess #002's pre-prediction was 2/3 correct (over-predicted weakness on specific-implementation when context was present). Guess #003 prediction this time is more granular — predict specific scores per layer. If actual scores fall within predicted ranges, calibration is improving.

## Confidence levels

| Layer | Confidence | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Architectural — "chat as ACID-durable DBSP event source" | **Medium** | Composes naturally with cross-disciplinary pattern adoption (DBSP at substrate level, Aaron's confirmed move) + substrate-or-it-didn't-happen + retraction-native discipline; but specific framing may differ from my generalization |
| Substrate-content — "chat-event schema + replay tool" | **Medium** | Z-set retraction semantics are well-established; replay tool composes with DST; but specific schema fields are inferred |
| Specific implementation — "auto-capture hook + docs/chat-events/ directory + replay TS tool" | **Low** | Standard event-sourcing pattern but no prior specific context for this row |
| Cross-row composition | **Medium-High** | Strong context for Otto-363 + Otto-272 + retraction-native composition |

## Ground truth (recovered 2026-05-03 ~03:30Z via direct read of B-0166)

Aaron's verbatim:

> *"i would like toget to the point where when i hit enter and send my message that is an event in the DBSP since so ACID durable, the downstram dirvations can do what they like on top, we are not there yet but that's the vision."*

5 enumerated purposes (row's own list): (1) compaction protection, (2) glass halo / influence-force visibility, (3) **future fine-tuning data for Anthropic's next-generation Claude**, (4) **training of new AIs/models** based on Aaron-Otto-Claude.ai practices, (5) architecture-as-code applied to chat itself.

Schema: `{timestamp, sender_role, sender_name, message_text, session_id, message_id, parent_message_id}` + structured tags. Multi-source ingest (Claude Code + Codex + future-AIs + human-direct). 7 derivation views. F# DBSP runtime (NOT TS). 6-phase implementation. composes_with: [B-0164 dual-loop attribution + reconciliation].

## Calibration delta — 17-18/40 = ~44% (lowest of three so far)

| Layer | Predicted | Actual | Within range? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Architectural | 6-7/10 | **6/10** PARTIAL-MATCH | ✓ |
| Substrate-content | 5-6/10 | **5/10** MIXED | ✓ |
| Specific implementation | 3-4/10 | **2-3/10** MOSTLY-OFF | ✗ (over by ~1pt) |
| Cross-row composition | 6-7/10 | **4/10** MOSTLY-OFF | ✗ (over by 2-3pt) |

### Architectural — got ACID/DBSP/glass-halo angle; missed training-substrate

Got: ACID-durable-preserves + DBSP-event semantics + replayability + glass-halo composition.

Missed: **chat-event-stream as fine-tuning data for Anthropic's next-gen + training material for new AIs**. The training-substrate angle (purposes #3 + #4) composes with the bidirectional alignment commitment — chat substrate becomes training data for future-Claude generations, making the experiment self-reinforcing across model versions.

### Substrate-content — got basic schema; missed multi-source ingest + 7 views

Multi-source ingest (Claude Code + Codex + future-AIs + human-direct) was the architecture-shaped piece I missed because B-0164 (dual-loop) wasn't in my read-state.

### Specific implementation — wrong language (TS vs F#) + wrong storage (file vs DBSP runtime)

The F#-vs-TS miss is the biggest specific error. Aaron's skill-design rule 2 ("TS files under tools/") doesn't apply to substrate-level work — DBSP runtime is F#. My rule-2 inference over-generalized.

### Cross-row composition — missed B-0164 dual-loop entirely

I had no read-state for B-0164 at all. The primary composition partner is a row I haven't read, so my inference was poor. **Validates context-dependent calibration pattern** from guess #002 — when read-state is absent for a layer, accuracy degrades regardless of principle-based reasoning.

## NEW PATTERN — read-state determines layer-level ceiling (3-data-point hypothesis)

| Layer | Driven by |
|---|---|
| Architectural | Aaron's framing + cross-disciplinary catalogue + general principles |
| Substrate-content | Specific row context + recent PR context |
| Specific implementation | Recent PR context for exact implementation choices |
| Cross-row composition | **Direct read-state for the composition partners** |

**Hypothesis**: layer-level-accuracy ≈ min(principle-reasoning-quality, read-state-coverage-for-that-layer).

For B-0166: principle-reasoning was good across layers, but read-state was thin (row title + general DBSP context). Cross-row composition scored low because read-state for B-0164 was zero. Specific implementation scored low because read-state for F# DBSP runtime production work was zero.

**Future-Otto rule**: when read-state is thin for a specific layer, predict that layer's score CONSERVATIVELY. Don't let principle-reasoning quality bleed into layer-level confidence when read-state is the actual ceiling.

## Pre-prediction validation — 2/4 within range

Improvement over #002 (2/3 = 67%). The pattern: I'm calibrated on architectural + substrate-content but over-predict on layers requiring specific read-state I lack.
