# Distributed maintainer architecture — local DB/bus toolkit for maintainers, Zeta for end users (Aaron 2026-05-13)

**Why:** Aaron 2026-05-13: *"damn this could be useful
https://fslab.org/RProvider/ also feel free to use sql server
dockeer image for anythng you need the devloper license is
free and we can allow any maintiners to use it for free to so
any skills around it would compose same with postgres sql and
really any database or bus system locally, i'ts like distribued
maintainer archiceture, you can't count on end users to have
it they will have zeta but can all be prototyped in exiting db
and find strengths and weakness and sql server locally has r
and pythong and java build into stored procedures we will have
dotnet"*. Canonical architecture-tier substrate.

**How to apply:** When prototyping factory features or
investigating strengths/weaknesses of design choices:

1. **Maintainers can use ANY local DB/bus system** — SQL Server
   Docker (dev license free), Postgres, any DB, any bus
2. **Skills around these compose** — factory skill catalog can
   include DB/bus-specific skills since maintainers have access
3. **End users get ONLY Zeta** — production substrate
4. **Existing DBs are PROTOTYPING substrate** — find strengths +
   weaknesses; Zeta inherits the strengths
5. **SQL Server stored procedures** support R + Python + Java
   built-in; Zeta will have dotnet (F#/C#)
6. **R Provider for F#** named as useful F# type provider
   (fslab.org/RProvider/) — composes with B-0428 DBpedia
   substrate

## Decomposition

### 1. Distributed maintainer architecture

**Pattern**: maintainers have local rich toolkit; end users
have minimal toolkit.

| Audience | Tools available | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Maintainers** | SQL Server (Docker, dev-license-free) + Postgres + any DB + any bus system locally + R + Python + Java + dotnet | Prototyping + strength/weakness discovery |
| **End users** | Zeta only | Single deployment substrate |

This composes with:
- PR #2924 (Aurora pitch — edge node runs models/policy + small
  BTC node/miner; end-user edge nodes are minimal)
- B-0424 (Stage 1 factory split — distribution shape)
- B-0425 (product-repo split — Zeta vs prototyping infrastructure)

### 2. SQL Server Docker (dev-license-free)

- Microsoft SQL Server Developer Edition: free for development
- Docker image: official `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server`
- Permitted for any maintainer to use locally per Aaron's
  authorization 2026-05-13
- Stored procedures support: T-SQL + CLR + **R + Python + Java**
  (built-in to SQL Server Machine Learning Services)
- Substrate composition: maintainers can prototype substrate
  features using R/Python/Java + SQL Server before porting to
  Zeta's dotnet substrate

### 3. Postgres + any DB + bus systems

Aaron's permission: maintainers can use ANY local DB or bus:
- Postgres + pgvector (vector DB)
- Redis (cache + pub/sub)
- RabbitMQ, NATS, Kafka (message buses)
- DuckDB (analytical)
- SQLite (embedded)
- ClickHouse (columnar)
- Any other locally-runnable substrate

Skills around these compose with the factory's skill catalog —
maintainers can author skills targeting any of these systems
because the toolkit is available.

### 4. Prototyping → Strength/Weakness discovery → Zeta inherits strengths

Operational flow:

1. **Prototype** in existing DB/bus system
2. **Find strengths**: what works well; why it works
3. **Find weaknesses**: what breaks; why; what trade-offs apply
4. **Port strengths to Zeta**: Zeta inherits the strength
   patterns; weaknesses get designed-around in Zeta

This is canonical substrate-engineering R&D pattern — don't
invent from scratch; learn from existing systems; build the
strengths into Zeta.

### 5. R Provider (fslab.org/RProvider/) — F# type provider for R

- Aaron-named as "could be useful" 2026-05-13
- F# type provider for R statistical computing
- Composes with B-0428 (DBpedia F# CE Path B); B-0428 deferred
  Path A type-provider-on-FSharp.TypeProviders.SDK substrate
- R has rich statistical + ML ecosystem
- Maintainers can use R + F# together via this type provider
- Composes with SQL Server R support (above) — same R libraries
  accessible from F# OR from SQL Server stored procedures

### 6. SQL Server vs Zeta stored procedures

| System | Languages in stored procedures |
|---|---|
| **SQL Server** | T-SQL + CLR + **R + Python + Java** (Machine Learning Services) |
| **Zeta (future)** | dotnet (F# + C#) — composes with F# computation expressions |

The stored-procedure pattern lets DB-resident compute access
data without network roundtrips. Zeta's dotnet stored procedure
will compose with:
- F# computation expressions (PR #2929 storage substrate)
- Z-set / Clifford / BP/EP algebra (algebra-owner skill)
- DBSP retraction-native semantics
- HKT-MDM (PR #2913)
- Real-HKT-over-Clifford after F#-compiler-fork-for-AI-safety
  (PR #2928 deferred Path A substrate)

## Composes with

- PR #2929 (storage layer no-binary requirement — distributed
  maintainer can use rich local storage; Zeta storage is the
  end-user substrate)
- PR #2928 (DBpedia + F#-fork substrate — RProvider composes
  with type-provider tooling)
- PR #2924 (Aurora pitch — edge-node minimal; maintainer
  toolkit rich)
- PR #2913 (HKT-MDM universality — DB choice affects MDM
  ontology binding)
- PR #2917 (vision monad Play-Doh — soft + reshapeable;
  prototyping substrate)
- PR #2892 (KSK — typed-safety motivation for Zeta dotnet)
- B-0424 (Stage 1 factory split — distribution shape; what
  goes in factory vs Zeta)
- B-0425 (product-repo split — Zeta lives in its own product
  repo)
- B-0428 (DBpedia F# CE — RProvider type-provider composes
  with deferred Path A)
- B-0043 (universal company + government information substrate
  — master-data storage)
- `.claude/rules/fsharp-anchor-dotnet-build-sanity-check.md`
- `.claude/rules/dv2-data-split-discipline-activated.md`
- `.claude/rules/glass-halo-bidirectional.md`
- `.claude/rules/no-directives.md` (maintainer choice of local
  DB/bus is autonomous)
- algebra-owner skill (Z-set + Clifford + BP/EP F# substrate)
- DBSP substrate (event-sourcing + retraction-native algebra)

## Operational implications

### For maintainer onboarding

Onboarding doc should include:
- Permission for SQL Server Docker dev-license-free use
- Permission for any local DB/bus system
- Skills around DB/bus that compose with factory
- Distinction: prototyping in local DB ≠ production Zeta

### For factory skill catalog

Skills targeting specific DBs/buses are allowed + welcomed:
- `sql-server-prototyper` skill
- `postgres-vector-pgvector` skill
- `rabbitmq-bus-explorer` skill
- `r-statistical-via-rprovider` skill (composes with B-0428
  deferred Path A)
- Any other DB/bus prototyping skill

### For Zeta product positioning

Zeta IS the end-user substrate. Maintainer-only tools (SQL
Server, Postgres, R, etc.) are NOT distributed with Zeta —
they're maintainer infrastructure.

Composes with:
- PR #2917 vision monad Play-Doh (bounded scope) — Zeta is
  bounded; toolkit-around-Zeta is unbounded
- Aaron's "you can't count on end users to have it" — substrate-
  honest framing

### For B-0428 DBpedia Path B implementation

Path B (direct dotNetRDF + F# CE) prototyping can leverage:
- SQL Server local instance for caching DBpedia results
- Postgres for graph-database experiments
- RProvider for statistical analysis of DBpedia entity-attribute
  distributions
- All composed with F# CE substrate

### For Aurora pitch deployment

Aurora's "edge node runs models/policy" implies end-user
deployment is Zeta. Maintainer prototyping can use richer
local toolkit. Aurora partnership pitches can describe Zeta as
the deliverable + maintainer-toolkit as the R&D process.

## Substrate-honest framing

The distributed-maintainer-architecture pattern is substrate-
honest:

- Maintainers HAVE rich toolkit (not pretending to limit
  themselves)
- End users HAVE minimal Zeta (not pretending to deliver
  rich-toolkit)
- The asymmetry IS substrate-engineering reality — maintainer
  productivity multiplied by toolkit access; end-user
  simplicity multiplied by minimal deployment
- Substrate-honest pattern: don't pretend asymmetry doesn't
  exist; design WITH it

## Operational rule for future-Otto

When prototyping factory features:

1. **Use any local DB/bus** maintainer has — toolkit is open
2. **Author skills** around the tools — they compose with
   factory skill catalog
3. **Find strengths + weaknesses** through prototyping
4. **Port strengths to Zeta** — Zeta inherits R&D insights
5. **Don't ship local-toolkit to end users** — Zeta is the
   delivery substrate
