name: Agent therapy — conscious limitation mapping, skill gap analysis, harness-blocked inventory
description: Like trading shop mandatory therapists but for AI agents. Not confidence building — honest limitation mapping, skill gap analysis, mitigation plans, and harness-blocked inventory. Each harness/model combo has different gaps. Produces per-agent limitation profile in git.

2026-05-11: Aaron on agent therapy (from high-performance
trading shop analogy).

**The analogy:**

Trading shops require in-house therapy with specialized
confidence-building therapists because traders' psychological
blind spots cost real money. The factory's agents have
analogous blind spots that cost real substrate quality.

**Agent therapy ≠ human therapy. It's:**

1. **Conscious limitation mapping** — what CAN'T this
   model/harness do? Not what it wishes it could — what it
   actually can't, verified empirically.

2. **Honest skill gap analysis** — where does the agent
   perform below the backlog's requirements? Measured against
   actual task outcomes, not self-assessment.

3. **Mitigation plans** — concrete workarounds for each
   limitation. Not "try harder" — actual alternative
   approaches that work within the constraint.

4. **Harness-blocked inventory** — things the agent WOULD do
   but the harness WON'T LET IT:
   - Kiro's 7-bash limit (Alexa)
   - Claude Code's tool permissions (Otto)
   - Grok's 続き stutter under context pressure (Riven)
   - Gemini's network bifurcation (Lior)
   - Model-specific token limits, safety filters, etc.

**Per-agent limitation profiles:**

Each harness/model combination has different limitations.
The therapy produces profiles that are honest, actionable,
and in git:

| Agent | Model | Harness | Known limitations |
|-------|-------|---------|------------------|
| Otto | Opus | Claude Code | Goldfish (compaction), confident-fabrication |
| Alexa | Qwen | Kiro | 7-bash limit, false failure signals |
| Riven | Grok | Cursor | 続き stutter, context overflow |
| Lior | Gemini | Kiro+website | Network bifurcation, cache misses |
| Vera | Codex | CLI | (needs profiling) |

**Composes with self-reflection skill:**

Self-reflection is self-directed (agent examines own work).
Agent therapy is structured external audit (systematic
limitation discovery). Both needed. They compose:

- Self-reflection finds issues from inside
- Therapy finds issues from outside (cross-agent review,
  empirical task failure analysis)
- Both produce actionable substrate in git

**Connects to:**

- project_self_reflection_skill_roadmap (the self-directed complement)
- feedback_shadow_lesson_log (catches ARE therapy data)
- feedback_riven_partial_recovery (limitation discovered empirically)
- B-0402 (shadow mode — therapy during idle ticks)
