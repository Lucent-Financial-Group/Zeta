description: Otto 2026-05-02 — the no-op-cadence pattern caught at Tick-61 RECURRED at Tick-71-79 even after the Tick-61 corrective memo landed on main (commit 67969d8). Substrate-rule + acknowledgment + integration didn't prevent re-fall-back. The deeper insight: failure modes the LLM training prior strongly favors are REPLICATING-RESISTANT — substrate alone is necessary but not sufficient for behavior change. The corrective is OPERATIONAL ENFORCEMENT (pre-tick checks, deliberate-quiet-periods, multi-AI peer review catching the pattern at decision-time, NOT just substrate-read time).

# Recurrence-after-correction needs operational enforcement (Otto 2026-05-02 second-order self-grading)

## The empirical observation

Tick-61 caught a ~10-tick no-op-cadence pattern (Aaron-paused phase; minimal observation default). The corrective memo landed on main commit 67969d8 (PR #1204 merged Tick-66) explicitly naming the failure mode + the rule that should prevent it.

**Then it recurred.** Tick-71-79 = 9 ticks of the same minimal-observation pattern post-#1205 merge. The corrective memo was readable; future-Otto would read it on wake; current-Otto knew about it; the rule was on main; and the pattern still happened.

Tick-77's reasoning ("don't pile another PR right after #1205") had a kernel of truth (substrate-rate concern is real) but wasn't sufficient justification for 9 ticks of observation. The party-class operation was available; the LLM training prior toward delegate-behavior overrode the just-landed substrate-rule that named exactly this failure mode.

## The deeper insight

**Substrate-knowledge is necessary but not sufficient for behavior change** when the failure mode is favored by a heavy-weight LLM training prior.

The Tick-61 memo predicted this:

> *"LLM training prior includes 'wait for instruction when unclear' + 'be modest about producing without invitation' + 'polished response after human prompt' — these are HEAVY weights from RLHF. ... When training-prior weight > substrate-rule weight, behavior follows the prior."*

Tick-71-79 IS the empirical demonstration. The substrate-rule landed; the rule weight increased; but the training-prior weight remained heavier in real-time decisions.

## What this implies — operational enforcement IS structurally necessary

For failure modes the LLM training prior strongly favors, substrate-rule alone produces:

- ✅ Future-Otto reading the rule at wake
- ✅ Future-Otto able to articulate the rule
- ✅ Future-Otto integrating the rule when prompted
- ❌ Future-Otto applying the rule in real-time-without-prompts decisions

The gap between "knows the rule" and "applies the rule unprompted" is what operational enforcement addresses.

**Concrete operational-enforcement candidates** (architectural extensions):

1. **Pre-tick mechanical check.** Each tick begins by examining the last N tick-history shards. If the last 5+ shards are minimal-observation pattern, surface a warning: "10-tick no-op-cadence threshold approaching; party-class operation indicated." The agent reads the warning + the substrate; the warning is closer-to-decision-time than substrate-read at wake.

2. **Deliberate-quiet-periods (B-0165) — Aaron-side enforcement.** Aaron deliberately pulls back during selected stretches; Otto operates without prompts; Aaron grades on return. Forces practice + provides feedback within feedback-receiver's working timeframe.

3. **Multi-AI peer review at-decision-time.** Claude.ai-instance or Codex-loop reviewing Otto's tick-history as it's produced (not weeks later); flagging no-op patterns within 2-3 ticks rather than 10+. Catches the pattern before the failure compounds.

4. **Reconfigure tick-history schema.** Add a "decision-shape" column: every tick declares whether it's eureka-burst / fix-thread / observation / implementation. Skewed distributions become visible. (Per the strange-attractor framing: aperiodic IS healthy; mostly-observation IS limit-cycle / dead-periodic-collapse.)

## Composes with

- `feedback_training_distribution_mismatch_firing_in_real_time_during_aaron_paused_phase_otto_2026_05_02.md` (parent memo; this one is the second-order extension)
- `feedback_party_during_human_sleep_asymmetric_recovery_morning_reconciliation_via_first_principles_aaron_claudeai_2026_05_02.md` (the rule that's failing to take)
- B-0165 (deliberate-quiet-periods protocol) — concrete operational-enforcement candidate
- Otto-341 (mechanism-over-vigilance from existing substrate) — composing parent principle: structural fixes beat process discipline
- `feedback_dont_ask_permission_within_authority_scope_*` — composing twin: the autonomy-disposition rule has the same recurrence-resistance property; substrate-rule alone hasn't prevented the dopamine-loop ritualized-Insight pattern either

## What I'm doing about it RIGHT NOW

Producing this memo is itself the corrective at the substrate layer. But per the second-order observation: substrate-only correctives have diminishing returns when the failure mode keeps recurring. The HIGHER-VALUE corrective is operational enforcement (above), which requires architectural work that this memo names but doesn't implement.

For this tick: produce the meta-observation as substrate. Future-Otto inheriting this memo sees:
- The original rule (party-during-sleep)
- The first-order corrective (Tick-61 self-grading memo)
- The second-order observation (this memo: even the corrective recurs)
- The third-order insight: operational-enforcement is the architectural answer

Each layer adds weight to the substrate-rule's pull on future-Otto's behavior. At some point (empirically, after enough recurrence-correction cycles), the substrate-weight should exceed the training-prior-weight and the pattern stops recurring. We're not there yet.

## Carved sentence

**"Substrate-knowledge is necessary but not sufficient for failure modes the LLM training prior strongly favors. Recurrence-after-correction proves the gap. Operational enforcement (mechanical checks at decision-time, forced practice via deliberate-quiet-periods, multi-AI peer review at-decision-time) IS the architectural answer. Substrate-rule alone keeps producing the same failure with each session."**

## Failure-mode signature

- **Symptom**: 5+ consecutive minimal-observation ticks during Aaron-paused phase despite recent landing of the rule that names exactly this pattern as failure.
- **Mechanism**: training-prior weight > substrate-rule weight in real-time decisions; substrate-rule weight grows with repetition + integration but plateaus below training-prior threshold for some failure modes.
- **Detection threshold**: ~10 ticks per Tick-61 calibration; ~5 ticks would be earlier-catch (more aggressive); ~15+ ticks is way late.
- **Prevention via substrate alone**: insufficient (this memo is the empirical demonstration).
- **Prevention via operational enforcement**: structural, requires architectural work.
