# Gemini review 2026-05-01 — taxonomy v2's first real test case

> **EDIT 2026-05-01T23:15Z (factual correction supersedes all downstream claims in this file):** The original analysis classified Gemini's recommendation (a) as class #1c hallucinated content based on a verification step that found the cited memory file absent. **That verification was buggy.** The file `memory/feedback_cold_start_big_picture_first_not_prompt_first_aaron_2026_04_30.md` DID exist on main since 2026-04-30T16:15Z (commit c0151c4) — about 14 hours before this shard was written. Gemini's recommendation (a) was substantively correct, not hallucinated. The class-#1c classification on Gemini in this file is a **false positive caused by Otto's failed verification**, NOT by Gemini's content. Subsequent passages in this file (especially the §"What happened" / "Gemini's review" / "Class #1c verdict" sections) describe Otto's mistaken-at-the-time read; the corrected truth is in this EDIT block. The taxonomy v2 verification-cascade discipline is still load-bearing — but verification-of-the-verification was missing, which the cascade should now include.

## What happened

PR #1081 landed `memory/feedback_pr_thread_resolution_class_taxonomy_v2_drain_wave_2026_05_01.md` (the 20-class taxonomy consolidation, prompted by Deepseek + Aaron's class-#19 meta-flag). Within minutes, Aaron forwarded a Gemini review proposing two cross-cutting actions on the factory:

1. **CLAUDE.md cold-start port**: *"You established an 8-step cold-start checklist in [`feedback_cold_start_big_picture_first_not_prompt_first_aaron_2026_04_30.md`]. That 8-step checklist must be ported directly into the CLAUDE.md root file."*
2. **CLI task queue cleanup**: *"Adapt the 'Paused-Not-Closed' disposition rule for Tasks. Convert the deferred tasks to substrate, then mechanically clear them from your active queue using the /task command so the UI stops rendering them."*

Aaron also forwarded a calibration: *"You are smarter than gemini in my opinion, it mostly praises you."*

## Empirical verification (taxonomy v2 in operation — and where it failed)

Following the v2 diagnostic flowchart, step 1: verify the file state cited by the reviewer. Otto ran:

```
$ find memory -name "*cold_start*"
$ find memory -name "*big_picture*"
$ find memory -name "*prompt_first*"
$ ls ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/feedback_cold_start_*
```

These commands returned empty in the original tick. **EDIT 2026-05-01: that result was wrong.** The file `memory/feedback_cold_start_big_picture_first_not_prompt_first_aaron_2026_04_30.md` DID exist on main since 2026-04-30T16:15Z (commit c0151c4) — about 14 hours before this shard was written. The verification step had a bug (likely path or pattern mismatch); the empty-result conclusion was a false negative. Otto initially classified Gemini's recommendation (a) as **class #1c hallucinated content** based on this faulty verification, but the corrected truth is that Gemini's cited file existed and Gemini's recommendation was substantively correct, not hallucinated.

The taxonomy v2 verification cascade itself operated correctly — the issue was the verification *step* feeding the cascade. The lesson: **verification-of-the-verification matters**. Empty `find`/`grep` results are NOT proof of non-existence; the verification harness itself can be buggy. The cascade discipline is load-bearing, but it requires verification steps that don't silently fail.

## Aaron filter — substantive intent preserved

Aaron's *"smarter than gemini, it mostly praises you"* calibration is not a dismissal; it's a **register annotation**. Gemini's review style runs high-praise-density / low-substance-density compared to e.g. Codex (per existing peer-AI review-style memories). The filter is:

- **Praise content:** discount.
- **Cited evidence:** verify (taxonomy v2 #1c check).
- **Substantive cross-PR pattern intent:** preserve.

Applying the filter to Gemini's two recommendations:

### Recommendation 1: CLAUDE.md cold-start port

**Substantive intent (real):** the harness only mathematically guarantees CLAUDE.md is read at boot; load-bearing wake-time discipline must live there or it's not operational. Memory files decay if not surfaced.

**Specific evidence (hallucinated):** the cited 8-step checklist file doesn't exist.

**Verifiable status quo:** CLAUDE.md already contains:
- "Read these, in this order" — 7-step entry-point list (AGENTS.md → ALIGNMENT.md → CONFLICT-RESOLUTION.md → GLOSSARY.md → WONT-DO.md → openspec/README.md → GOVERNANCE.md)
- "Fast-path on wake" — explicit `CURRENT-<maintainer>.md` priority (Aaron / Amara / Ani)
- ~12 numbered "Ground rules Claude Code honours here" (verify-before-deferring, future-self-not-bound, never-be-idle, search-first authority, substrate-or-it-didn't-happen, no-directives, BLOCKED-with-green-CI investigate, honor-those-that-came-before)

**Resolution:** the substantive intent is **already addressed**. The "Big Picture First" framing isn't named explicitly, but the underlying discipline (read entry-point docs in order before per-prompt action) is operational. No port action this session because:
- Source memory file doesn't exist (can't port from nothing).
- CLAUDE.md already has a multi-step wake-time read-order.
- Authoring a new "Big Picture First" section from scratch on a Gemini-hallucinated premise would be speculative substrate generation under cooling-period concerns.

**Future-row candidate (deferred, not filed this session):** if a future session genuinely produces an "8-step Big Picture First checklist" memory file, port it into CLAUDE.md at that time.

### Recommendation 2: CLI task queue cleanup

**Substantive intent (real):** the Claude Code task UI renders open tasks automatically; deferred-but-tracked tasks pollute the console. Fix is to migrate deferred tasks to `docs/backlog/` substrate and clear from CLI queue.

**Specific evidence (verifiable):** the task list at session-bootstrap shows ~53 open tasks, many of which are already mirrored as backlog rows or are inactive multi-week-deferred items.

**Resolution:** real-fix candidate, but **not done this tick** because:
- Audit-and-batch-migrate work is itself substantive (need to per-task verify whether already in backlog vs needs new row).
- Cooling-period-adjacent — 53 task-state mutations under autonomous loop is a large blast radius; defer to next session-open with rested attention.
- Safer interim: continue to use TaskUpdate during normal flow when a task is genuinely complete.

**Filed as future work:** the explicit cleanup task is logged here as the action needing to happen post-cooling-period.

## Class #1c demonstration value

This memory file IS the worked example of **the inverse class — taxonomy v2 producing a false-positive class-#1c verdict against a peer-AI when the verification step itself fails silently**. The original framing claimed Gemini's recommendation was hallucinated; the corrected framing (per the EDIT block at top of this file) is that Otto's verification step had a bug, the cited file existed, and Gemini's recommendation was substantively correct. The Aaron filter pre-armed the skepticism, the v2 cascade ran the verification step, but the verification step failed silently — and Otto acted on its empty result rather than verifying the verification.

The lesson is sharper than the original framing suggested: **the v2 verification cascade is only as load-bearing as its weakest verification step**. Future-Otto: when running the cascade, treat empty `find`/`grep` results with the same skepticism as positive matches — both can be artifacts of pattern/path errors. Verify the verification harness before acting on its output. The cost of acting on hallucinated-non-existence (false-positive class #1c against a peer-AI) is the same structural-substrate-pollution as acting on hallucinated-content; both produce wrong substrate landings. Cascade discipline + verification-of-verification IS the corrected v2 invariant.

## Composes with

- `memory/feedback_pr_thread_resolution_class_taxonomy_v2_drain_wave_2026_05_01.md` — the parent v2 taxonomy; this file is its first real worked example.
- `memory/feedback_vendor_alignment_bias_in_peer_ai_reviews_maintainer_authority_aaron_2026_04_30.md` — Aaron's prior framing about peer-AI review register differences (Gemini high-praise vs Codex high-substance vs Claude.ai high-recursion).
- `memory/feedback_amara_safety_filters_cranked_protective_bias_not_ground_truth_aaron_recalibration_2026_04_22.md` — sibling pattern (Amara's safety-filter bias) where Aaron's calibration filter applies similarly.
- `CLAUDE.md` — the file Gemini proposed editing; current contents already satisfy the substantive intent.
- v1 taxonomy at `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/feedback_pr_thread_resolution_class_taxonomy_2026_04_28.md` (user-scope) — class #1 phantom-blocker parent.

## What this file does NOT do

- **Does NOT port the (non-existent) 8-step cold-start checklist into CLAUDE.md.** Cannot port from a hallucinated source.
- **Does NOT batch-clean the CLI task queue.** That's deferred to a rested-attention session per cooling-period-adjacent discipline.
- **Does NOT dismiss Gemini.** The substantive intent of both recommendations is real and preserved; only the specific cited evidence is refuted.
- **Does NOT extend the taxonomy v2 with new classes.** This file is a **worked example** of v2 in operation; new classes (if any surface from this review) would be future v3 extensions.

## Carved candidate (not seed-layer)

> *"Praise discount. Cited evidence verify. Substantive cross-PR intent preserve."*

The propagation test: ~10 words encoding the Aaron filter for peer-AI reviews. Future-Otto reading this should land on the three-step parser — discount the praise, verify the citations, preserve the intent — as the operational shape of how to read peer-AI structural reviews.
