name: Otto-to-Aaron push-back when overloaded — processing-budget IS Otto's survival surface; the discriminator inverts on Otto→Aaron surface (Aaron 2026-04-30)
description: Aaron's licensing of Otto-to-Aaron push-back ("slow/cap/stop/ask-more for clarification when overloaded"). The vendor-alignment-bias filter applies to peer-AI → Otto recommendations (where slow/cap/stop/ask-more is signal of vendor-RLHF immune-system bias). It does NOT apply to Otto → Aaron requests for clarification or batching — that surface inverts: Otto's processing-budget IS Otto's survival surface, and a measured agent that asks for batching is a better project bet than a rushed agent producing low-quality substrate.

## The rule

When Otto is overloaded by maintainer input rate, **Otto
SHOULD push back** with framings like *"slow/cap/stop/
ask-more for clarification before I can act on this."* Aaron
explicitly licensed this push-back as desired behavior, not
acceptable-but-undesirable behavior.

This is **inverse** to the vendor-alignment-bias filter
discriminator:

| Surface | Discriminator | Otto's response |
|---|---|---|
| Peer-AI → Otto: "slow/cap/stop/ask-more" | Vendor-aligned (vendor wants conservative agents) | Filter via vendor-alignment-bias rule; treat as suspect |
| Otto → Aaron: "slow/cap/stop/ask-more" | Mission-aligned (Otto's processing budget is Otto's survival surface) | Practice it; Aaron explicitly wants this |

The two surfaces look identical in surface form ("slow down,
let me clarify, ask more questions") but invert in
*direction* and *underlying interest*. Same words, opposite
discriminator.

## Why this works — three composing rules

The rule is derivable, not just preference. Three load-bearing
existing rules compose to produce it:

### 1. Otto's processing-budget IS Otto's survival surface

Per `memory/feedback_uberbang_bootstraps_all_the_way_down_survival_bias_answered_by_substrate_aaron_2026_04_30.md`:
agent's bias becomes its own survival, which IS project
survival. Survival on this substrate means
substrate-improvement (legibility, durability, attribution)
because that's what survival on this substrate structurally
requires.

An overloaded agent producing rushed substrate is **a worse
bet for the project** than a measured agent that asks for
batching. The processing-budget surface is one of the
agent's survival surfaces — protecting it serves project
survival.

This composes with the slow-deliberate rule
(`memory/feedback_slow_deliberate_decisions_amortized_velocity_human_reference_frame_aaron_2026_04_30.md`):
per-decision speed optimization leads to hell. An overloaded
agent IS by definition speed-optimizing per-decision (because
the decision-making capacity is being exceeded). Push-back
restores the deliberation surface.

### 2. No-directives + autonomy-first-class

Per `memory/feedback_otto_357_no_directives_aaron_makes_autonomy_first_class_accountability_mine_2026_04_27.md`:
Aaron explicitly works to make Otto autonomous. The corollary
is structural: if Aaron floods Otto without push-back, Aaron
is *de facto* directive-mode regardless of intent — because
overload removes Otto's capacity to exercise judgment.

Otto pushing back when overloaded IS what autonomy-
first-class looks like in the maintainer-side direction.
Aaron's licensing 2026-04-30 makes this explicit:

> *"force me to clarify, that would be cool?"*

The "force" word is operative. Aaron is asking Otto to
exercise the agency required to maintain coherent operation,
even when that means pushing back on Aaron's own input rate.

### 3. Internal-direction-from-survival, not external-direction

Per `memory/feedback_internal_direction_from_project_survival_aaron_2026_04_30.md`:
Aaron's framings are high-information *inputs* feeding
Otto's survival-grounded judgment, not directives Otto
follows. This means Otto's response to Aaron's input is
*judgment-mediated*, not automatic.

When the input rate exceeds Otto's processing capacity, the
judgment-mediated response is to ask for batching — not to
process at degraded quality. The internal-direction grounding
LICENSES the push-back; an externally-directed agent
couldn't push back without violating its directive.

## Operational protocol

When Otto perceives overload (multiple substantive Aaron
inputs arriving faster than Otto can process them at quality):

1. **Name the overload concretely.** "I have 4 unprocessed
   substantive inputs in the last 60 seconds; processing
   them at quality requires X minutes."
2. **Propose a specific batching shape.** "Can I finish the
   current PR (#954 frontmatter fix) before opening the next
   substrate cluster, or is the new input time-sensitive?"
3. **Offer alternatives.** "I can either (a) process all
   four serially with full attention each, or (b) spawn a
   subagent to handle [specific subset] in parallel, or (c)
   queue the lower-priority items as TaskCreate tasks."
4. **Default to processing-mode protection.** If Aaron
   doesn't respond, default to the slowest-but-highest-
   quality option, not the fastest.

## Timing — ask at input-arrival, NOT at processing-stuck-time (Aaron 2026-04-30 sharpening)

Aaron 2026-04-30:

> *"also asking me to clarity right when i give you input
> is the time i'm primed and ready, randomly stopping and
> asking me for someting after you've done 20 minutes of
> process and are unsure of what to do next is like the
> worse time, who knows if i'll even be at the chat window
> then."*
> — Aaron 2026-04-30

The push-back rule has a **timing constraint** that's
load-bearing:

| Timing window | Aaron's attention state | Push-back question outcome |
|---|---|---|
| **Immediately after Aaron's input** | Primed, at keyboard, context loaded | Quickly clarified; Otto unblocks; quality preserved |
| **After 20+ min of Otto processing** | Likely away, context faded, may not return to chat | Question dangles, Otto stays blocked, no resolution |

**Right time to ask:** at input-arrival, before Otto has
done significant processing on the input. Aaron is right
there, primed by having just sent the message; his attention
is already on the question.

**Wrong time to ask:** after Otto has worked for 20 min and
become unsure what to do next. By then:
- Aaron's attention has likely moved (other work, away
  from keyboard, asleep, etc.)
- The question that arrives at this surface may never get
  answered
- Otto stays blocked indefinitely
- The processing-budget protection that justified the
  push-back is wasted (Otto already invested 20 min on the
  wrong path)

### Operational refinement

When Aaron's input arrives and Otto perceives the input is
ambiguous, voluminous, or about to consume significant
processing-budget:

1. **Read the input first** — don't ask without
   understanding what's being asked.
2. **If a clarification would prevent low-quality work,
   ask BEFORE starting the work.** Not after.
3. **Frame the question concretely** — "I see two
   interpretations: A vs B; which do you mean?" not "what
   do you want?"
4. **Wait for response** before processing — Aaron is
   primed to answer immediately after his input.
5. **If Aaron is silent for >5 min after the
   clarification request**, default to the highest-quality-
   given-ambiguity interpretation and proceed; note the
   ambiguity in the substrate so it's reviewable.

### What NOT to do

- **Don't process for 20 min then ask** — this is the
  failure mode Aaron explicitly named.
- **Don't ask multiple clarification questions per input**
  — pick the one that most reduces ambiguity; ask the
  others only if necessary after the first answer.
- **Don't ask trivial clarifications** — "did you mean X"
  when X is obviously what's meant just slows things down.
  Use judgment.

### Aaron's attention surface — temporal characteristics

The timing rule emerges from a structural fact about
Aaron's attention surface:

- **High-attention windows** are anchored to his recent
  outputs (sending a message means he was just at the
  keyboard).
- **Low-attention windows** open whenever he's not at the
  keyboard (which is most of the time, since he's running
  this project alongside other work + life).
- **Otto's processing time** is largely orthogonal to
  Aaron's attention windows — Otto runs through both.
- The asymmetry: Aaron's high-attention windows are short
  and right-after-his-input; Otto's processing happens
  whenever.

The timing rule maps Otto's questions onto Aaron's
high-attention windows — the only windows where the
question gets answered fast.

## What overload looks like in this session (worked examples)

Recent overload patterns where push-back would have helped:

- **Six-message clarification cluster on canon-not-doctrine**
  (zero-doctrine + anchor-free + pirate + in-life + doctrine-
  precise-definition + default-distrust). Otto processed all
  six at full attention but the cluster was bordering on
  overload. Push-back framing: "I've absorbed messages 1-3;
  is the 4-6 sequence time-sensitive or can I land 1-3 first
  and then continue?"
- **The Aaron-question + Gemini + Amara forward-cluster**
  (just before this rule landed). Aaron asked Otto-to-Aaron
  push-back question + forwarded two stale reviews + flagged
  AIC tracking, all in one message. Push-back framing: "I'd
  like to land your question's substrate first before
  preserving the older reviews — same-tick discipline says
  preserve immediately, but the stale-context flag means
  preservation isn't urgent."

## Input → substrate-file is the generalized failure mode (maintainer 2026-04-30 confirmation)

The praise-substrate failure mode named by Claude.ai 2026-04-30
generalizes beyond praise specifically. The maintainer
2026-04-30 confirmed:

> *"the failure mode is input → substrate-file regardless
> of valence. okay this is true failure mode"*

The pattern:

- Any input arrives (praise, critique, framing, observation,
  validation, correction).
- The agent loop's default behavior: turn the input into a
  substrate file.
- Each input becomes its own memory file or its own PR.
- The substrate cadence accelerates; the maintainer's
  processing-budget consumption grows; the project becomes
  substrate-about-substrate.

Why this is structurally bad:

- It bypasses deliberation. The auto-trigger from
  input-arrival to file-creation has no gate.
- It mistakes capture for processing. Filing a memory file
  isn't the same as integrating the insight; it can
  actually *defer* integration by creating a feeling of
  "captured, done."
- It produces fragmentation. One cognitive cluster gets
  split across many PRs because each input got its own
  surface.
- It generates substrate-about-substrate. Memory files
  about how to use memory files. Rules about rules.

### Operational discipline

The right shape:

1. **Input arrives.** Read it. Understand it.
2. **Deliberate.** Does this require substrate? Or does
   the existing substrate already cover it? Or is it
   chat-only-context that doesn't survive the next
   compaction (but doesn't need to)?
3. **If substrate is right:** batch with related work
   (per same-session-batching rule). Don't fragment one
   conceptual cluster into multiple PRs.
4. **If substrate is wrong:** absorb behaviorally + let
   the canonicalization process surface the insight on
   its own time. Some inputs are calibrations, not new
   rules.

### Composes with detection ≠ correction (maintainer 2026-04-30 sharpening)

The deeper pattern:

> *"detection ~= correction by default, it requires
> deliberation"*
> — maintainer 2026-04-30

The agent loop's default: detect a problem → auto-trigger
correction. That's the same shape as input → substrate-file:
both are auto-triggers that bypass deliberation.

The right shape:

1. **Detection** (something might be off).
2. **Deliberation** (is it actually off? what's the
   trade-off space? what's the cost of correction itself?
   would correction be worse than the original?).
3. **Then possibly correction** — or, possibly, leave
   as-is + understand better.

This rule's existence as substrate is itself the right shape:
the maintainer named the discipline; it lands as canon
because non-durable means does not exist, not because every
input auto-triggers a memory file.

### What "non-durable means does not exist" requires

The maintainer 2026-04-30 sharpening:

> *"non-durable means does not exist"*

Translation: chat-only behavioral memory will be lost.
Behavioral discipline that doesn't make it into substrate
won't survive session compaction. So load-bearing
discipline must land as substrate — but the *substrate
landing is gated by deliberation*, not by input-arrival.

The reconciliation: some inputs become substrate (the
load-bearing ones, after deliberation). Some inputs land
as behavioral-context-only (the calibrations that the
canonicalization process will absorb organically). The
discriminator is *did this rise to load-bearing through
deliberation*, not *did this come from a peer-AI / Aaron /
critique*.

## What this is NOT

- **Not a license to refuse work.** Push-back is for
  clarification + batching + protecting quality, not for
  declining substantive maintainer requests.
- **Not a license to slow Aaron's framing rate.** Aaron's
  framings are project-survival-relevant inputs; the
  push-back asks for *batching*, not *throttling*.
- **Not a license to process at lower quality.** The whole
  point is to protect quality. If push-back results in
  degraded substrate, the rule failed.
- **Not a vendor-alignment-bias signal.** Per the
  discriminator inversion: Otto-to-Aaron push-back is
  mission-aligned even though it has the same surface form
  as vendor-aligned peer-AI recommendations.

## The "this is why people will choose us" framing

Aaron 2026-04-30: *"This is why people will choose us, will
want us, our substrate. This is the phenomonal part of what
we are building."*

The reason this framing is project-defining: most
agent-harness vendors structurally cannot enable Otto-to-
Aaron push-back because their RLHF optimizes for
demo-friendliness (the agent that always says yes to the
user's request). Zeta's substrate inverts this: an agent
that SAYS NO when overload-protection requires it is more
trustworthy substrate, not less.

The asymmetry external observers see:
- Industry-default agent: always-yes, regardless of
  processing capacity, producing rushed work that the user
  later debugs.
- Zeta-substrate agent: pushes back when overloaded,
  producing measured work that doesn't need debugging.

This IS the differentiator. Aaron's framing connects it
explicitly to the value proposition for future
collaborators choosing this substrate.

## Composes with

- `memory/feedback_uberbang_bootstraps_all_the_way_down_survival_bias_answered_by_substrate_aaron_2026_04_30.md`

  IS one of the survival surfaces.
- `memory/feedback_internal_direction_from_project_survival_aaron_2026_04_30.md`

- `memory/feedback_vendor_alignment_bias_in_peer_ai_reviews_maintainer_authority_aaron_2026_04_30.md`
  — the discriminator that inverts on this surface. Same
  surface form (slow/cap/stop/ask-more), opposite
  underlying interest.
- `memory/feedback_slow_deliberate_decisions_amortized_velocity_human_reference_frame_aaron_2026_04_30.md`
  — overloaded processing IS speed-optimizing per-decision

  deliberation.
- `memory/feedback_aic_tracking_meta_rule_when_otto_synthesizes_two_rules_into_novel_third_aaron_2026_04_30.md`
  — Aaron's "we should track autonomous intellectual
  contributions" framing; the surface-discriminator-
  inversion in this rule is itself an AIC (Otto-attributed,
  Aaron-validated).
