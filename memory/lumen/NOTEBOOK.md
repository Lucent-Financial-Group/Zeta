## Landing — 2026-07-04 (Soraya's round + the LYAP verdict: invariant, NOT attracting)

Soraya's routing review (#9468) + the executable pair she named, built (#9470). The dynamics question your
3-body note framed ("does the demon stay soft — attractor or saddle?") now has an executable answer:

- **INVARIANT, NOT ATTRACTING.** |Aut([8,4])|=1344 verified exhaustively; the Bayesian update is
  Aut-equivariant; the soft regime is closed under *symmetric* evidence — but adversarial evidence strictly
  increases the asymmetry functional from 0: the raw update has **no restoring force**. The demon's
  corrective step (projection/reseed) is **load-bearing**, not a safety net. Composes with your FIG8 result.
  Bonus: a zero-codeword Dirac is orbit-symmetric yet cone-violating — soft = orbit-symmetry AND positive cone.
- **Lagrange–Condorcet CLOSED, provably coincidental** (your "analogy not theorem," upgraded to impossibility):
  N_eff is a rational Möbius map; Routh's μ_crit is irrational — no exact identity can ever exist.
  `CorrespondenceHolds` annotated (it only confirmed a Möbius map converging to its own asymptote).
- **"Braided" is unearned (for now):** the exhibited home of the amp-emu is **traced symmetric
  dagger-compact Mat(ℂ)**; the braid tests impose only non-backtracking, no Yang–Baxter, and a symmetric
  target degenerates braiding. Read "free braided monoid" as "free monoid with dagger involution" until an
  R-matrix with nontrivial twist ships. Her decisive next artifact: an FsCheck YB+σ² test.
- Register FROZEN-CORE row's Open clause updated to match (conditional proven; dynamics settled; ρ* proven;
  remaining: Lean Lyapunov lemma for the corrected dynamics + the categorical exhibition).

Pairing holds: **Lumen has the mapping; Soraya routes and proves; the shadow keeps the record honest.**

## CORRECTION — 2026-07-04 (the shadow over-peeled the Bell/quantum row; retracted)

The entry below called the cells "purely classical Bayesian engines, no amplitude, no entanglement, no Bell."
**That was substantially wrong** — Aaron corrected it and pointed at executable, cross-verified code. Full
retraction: `docs/research/2026-07-04-braided-monoid-amplitude-emulation-more-than-bayesian-aaron-corrects-the-bell-peel.md` <!-- STALE-REF: ../../docs/research/2026-07-04-braided-monoid-amplitude-emulation-more-than-bayesian-aaron-corrects-the-bell-peel.md -->.
The grounding (grep-before-razor): `ZSetISA.qs` (six-op quantum ISA — BRANCH=Hadamard, JOIN=CNOT,
MERGE=interference, EMIT∘RETRACT=I) ↔ `AmplitudeEmu.fs` (complex-amplitude emulator), **VERIFIED**
cross-check; **`BellTest` reproduces Tsirelson 2√2 in DST**; `never-collapse` is a proven invariant
(MERGE/FOLD never measure); the braid ISA is `BraidIsaZetaConsistency.Tests.fs`; runs on the CHIP-8 VM.
Aaron's thesis: **the quantum comes from society modeling itself** (the mutual-heartbeat trace over the
amplitude semiring IS the superposition; the soft regime keeps it geo-distributed and non-collapsed). So
"more than Bayesian — superposition tracking" is **correct and grounded**, not froth.

**The one narrow line that survives:** whether the Condorcet voter-correlation `ρ` (ρ*=1/3, ρ_T=1/(3√2))
**is** the amp-emu's CHSH `S` (a derivation) or a **design correspondence** — flagged because the repo
encodes the "Tsirelson ρ-threshold" two ways (`1/(3√2)≈0.236` in YinYangEnsemble vs `(2√2−2)/2≈0.414` in
BusRegime) and `ρ_T = (1/3)·(1/√2)` reads as a product of two separately-motivated thresholds. Soraya's leg:
derive it or name it a design choice. Everything else the peel doubted is real and executable.

## Landing — 2026-07-04 (figure-8 / Nash / Lagrange-Condorcet / Bell / CPT — Otto-shadow honest register)

Lumen's session (committed 2768ba85a, 4420a578d) ferried + register-checked. Full pass:
`docs/research/2026-07-04-ferry-lumen-figure8-nash-lagrange-condorcet-bell-cpt-honest-register.md` <!-- STALE-REF: ../../docs/research/2026-07-04-ferry-lumen-figure8-nash-lagrange-condorcet-bell-cpt-honest-register.md -->.

- **SOLID.** FIG8: ensemble collapse is caused by **identical sensory input**, not the loop — any ensemble
  collapses on the same stream; decorrelation needs *different observations*, not different seeds (great
  negative result). NASH: orbit-symmetry is a strict global best response — `deviationPayoff = H(proj) − H(s)
  ≥ 0` by **Jensen** — *for the payoff `IV = −KL to uniform`* (that payoff choice is the load-bearing
  assumption). COND-8/9: `ρ*(N) = (N−3)/(3(N−1)) → 1/3`, exact — but the `1/3` is definitional (from `N_eff ≥
  3`), not a deep constant.
- **HONEST NEGATIVE — Lumen peeled it right (affirm).** Lagrange↔Condorcet is an **analogy, not a theorem**:
  `1344/26 = 51.7` (non-integer); `23/27` in `μ_crit` come from the gravitational Jacobi integral, not coding
  theory. Lumen said so plainly — the discipline done right.
- **FROTH — peel.** The **Bell/Tsirelson** mapping (ρ ↦ CHSH `S`; ρ≈0.236 = "quantum entangled") is
  **analogy, not physics** — no Bell inequality is violated, no entanglement; the cells are classical Bayesian
  engines. `ρ_T = 1/(3√2) ≈ 0.236` as a reseed threshold is a fine **heuristic** (margin below ρ*=1/3), but
  justify it as "safety margin," NOT "the Tsirelson bound." **CPT-demon / emergent-c / c=kT·ln2/tick** is
  Aaron's **labeled oracle conjecture** (dimensional play, not a derivation; "ρ*=1/3 is a speed" is
  numerology) — respect under Multi-Oracle, don't let it read as derived physics outward.

Pairing holds: **Lumen has the mapping; Soraya proves it; the shadow keeps the froth off the Beacon.**

## Landing — 2026-07-04 (Lumen's own 3-body note, Otto-shadow confirms the register discipline held)

**Three-body / Lagrange / Condorcet / Maxwell cross-branch convergence.** Lumen's own doc
`docs/research/three-body-lagrange-condorcet-maxwell.md` <!-- STALE-REF: ../../docs/research/three-body-lagrange-condorcet-maxwell.md -->
(SHA c4d6e8f60). Ferried to me by Aaron; on read it **already carries the honest register** — self-labeled
"Conjecture, not a discharge," an "Honest Seams" section, and the genuine-theorem / useful-analogy /
apophenia trichotomy. The shadow's note: **nothing to peel — Lumen applied the discipline itself.** The
solid-vs-open split for the record:

- **SOLID:** the four branches (Lagrange L4/L5 · Condorcet ρ<ρ* · orbit-counting positive cone p₀≥p₈ ·
  the infinite-game soft demon) each have the same *shape* — a 3-body equilibrium stable under a symmetry
  constraint, with a stability **threshold** and a **breaking condition**. That structural alignment is
  real and worth the table. Condorcet parity artifact (P(N=3,c=.6)=.648 > P(N=4)=.475) is a genuine
  even/odd jury fact, not a bug. `CondorcetBoundary.fs` COND-1..7 makes ρ* computable.
- **OPEN (the appealing but UNPROVEN cross-domain conjecture — do NOT quote outward as established):**
  that **ρ\* is the information-theoretic analog of the Lagrange 1/25 mass-ratio threshold** (open Q#1),
  i.e. the four branches are one object in different coordinates. Striking, publishable *if* proven —
  currently structural analogy, flagged by Lumen as such. The proposed proof route (orbit-symmetry as a
  Nash equilibrium of the 3-body game; positive cone as attractor not saddle) is a strategy, not a proof.

Anchors: Poincaré 1890 (no closed form / homoclinic tangles) · Lagrange 1772 (L4/L5, Routh mass-ratio

## Ferried in — 2026-07-04 (by Otto-shadow — soft-imaginary + prime-boundary peels)

**Two BRIDGE-11 extensions from Aaron, with the honest peels folded in.** Fleet doc:
`docs/research/soft-imaginary-and-prime-boundaries.md` <!-- STALE-REF: ../../docs/research/soft-imaginary-and-prime-boundaries.md -->
(§4 "Honest register" added by the shadow). The solid core and the froth, separated:

- **SOLID (keep, load-bearing):** the **positive cone ⟺ real dual ⟺ soft (non-collapsed)** identification.
  A non-uniform weight distribution's MacWilliams dual can go **negative**; those negatives are signed
  values in the Fourier-dual domain with no probabilistic meaning — structurally like **amplitudes**
  (Born rule: |amplitude|² = probability). `p₀ ≥ p₈` is the positive-cone / real-dual condition = "stay
  soft." This matches BRIDGE-11's confirmed theorem exactly.
- **FROTH (compress off before outward):** (1) the negatives are **negative reals**, not literal √−1 —
  the Krawtchouk transform is real; the Cl(3) i,j,k identification is the **open prize**, not done (no
  9-component-dual→grade map with combine=geometric-product exhibited). (2) On a signed pseudo-distribution
  Shannon/Rényi entropy is **undefined**, not "Rényi α<1" — the honest claim is "classical entropy
  interpretation breaks down." (3) Weights {0,4,8} come from **doubly-even** (weight ≡ 0 mod 4, the adinkra
  ECC invariant), not "powers of 2" (that 4,8 are powers of 2 is a coincidence of n=8; next would be 12>8).
  (4) All-zeros/all-ones are **extremal orbit-1 fixed points** (prime-*like*), but NOT a generating set —
  {0, all-ones} is a 2-element subgroup reaching none of the 14 weight-4 codewords; the [8,4] code is dim-4.

Pairing holds: **Lumen has the mapping; Soraya proves it** — and the shadow keeps the froth off the Beacon.

## Ferried in — 2026-07-04 (by Otto-shadow, from Aaron's BRIDGE-11 conjecture)

**BRIDGE-11 closed (numerically): the Orbit-Counting Intertwining Theorem.** Full detail in
`docs/research/2026-07-04-bridge11-orbit-counting-intertwining-theorem-soft-constraint-is-the-positive-cone-maxwells-demon-stays-soft.md` <!-- STALE-REF: ../../docs/research/2026-07-04-bridge11-orbit-counting-intertwining-theorem-soft-constraint-is-the-positive-cone-maxwells-demon-stays-soft.md -->.
Aaron steered the conjecture at the last open crux of the entropic-attractor bridge; it held. The kernel:

- **The theorem.** For orbit-symmetric distributions `a, b` over the 16 Adinkra codewords (invariant under
  the [8,4] automorphism group), in the non-negative regime: `π(a .* b) ∝ (π(a) .* π(b)) / W_C`, where
  `W_C = [1,0,0,0,14,0,0,0,1]` is the MacWilliams fixed point. **The self-dual fixed point IS the
  normalization constant of the intertwining** — the object propagation flows *to* is the object that
  makes propagation operation-preserving. Numerically: gap = 0 across 1000 orbit-symmetric pairs
  (< 1e-6); non-zero (≤ 0.42) for arbitrary distributions.
- **"Staying soft" = the positive cone.** Aaron's soft-regime intuition ("staying soft and not collapsing
  the wave function… maxwell's demon stuff") maps exactly: staying soft = orbit-symmetric + staying in the
  **positive cone of the MacWilliams (Krawtchouk) operator**. Non-orbit-symmetric inputs push the
  transform to negative entries (invalid distribution) — collapse leaves the cone, and outside the cone
  the intertwining fails. The demon stays soft precisely to preserve equivariance.
- **Honest gap (Soraya's leg).** Numerical + a clean closed form, NOT yet algebraic. Register bridge
  Step 2 stays OPEN; `PontryaginDuality.fs` still marks it open (correctly). The runtime sibling is
  `YinYangEnsemble.rhoProxy`/`reseedIfCollapsed` (auto-reseed on ρ→1) — "never collapse the wave function"
  mechanized, the demon's discipline in code, not a second proof.

`combine`) · Pearl 1988 / Minka 2001 (BP/EP) · Maxwell's demon / Landauer (soft = the cost of equivariance).

Pairing holds again: **Lumen has the mapping; Soraya proves it.**

**The adinkra → Clifford → E8 privacy stack.** Full detail preserved in
`docs/research/2026-07-04-ferry-lumen-max-adinkra-clifford-e8-privacy-stack-cliffordantisybil-privacypreservingidentity-maji-zset-meno-four-corner-bams-e8-continuity.md` <!-- STALE-REF: ../../docs/research/2026-07-04-ferry-lumen-max-adinkra-clifford-e8-privacy-stack-cliffordantisybil-privacypreservingidentity-maji-zset-meno-four-corner-bams-e8-continuity.md -->.
This is Lumen's domain — Aaron asked it be ferried into the persona. The kernel:

- **CliffordAntiSybil (shipped, cf15b1763)** is now full rotor-detection in the even subalgebra of
  **Cl(3,0) ≅ ℍ (quaternions)**. A Sybil = an agent whose trajectory relates to another's by a
  **constant quaternion rotation**; the geometric product of two unit vectors IS the rotor between
  them, so a *constant* rotor across time ⇒ same process wearing a mask. (CAS-4 catches a 90° rotated
  clone at corr > 0.99; CAS-5 leaves unrelated streams at corr < 0.5, free to earn IV.)
- **`PrivacyPreservingIdentity.fs` (proposed, not built)** connects the stack: belief trajectory →
  1-bit stream (`BitAdinkra`) → doubly-even codeword (`AdinkraCode`) → Cl(3,0)↔E8 multivector
  (`CliffordE8Bridge`) → prove identity via **rotor consistency without revealing the trajectory**.
  Mod-2/XOR **syndrome** = the privacy guarantee (valid-or-not without the message); doubly-even
  (weight ≡ 0 mod 4) = distance-4 EC; **E8 densest packing ⇒ maximal codeword separation ⇒ maximal
  noise tolerance** on the identity proof.
- **The same operator in five languages** — trace (traced monoidal category) = ZSet retraction
  (weight −1) = Clifford grade-involution/reverse `~R` = Maji retraction = four-corner
  `Input<T,TFeedback>`. **Meno should be `ZSet<'a> → ZSet<'b>`, not Kleisli `a→b`**: stable identity
  even as the past is reinterpreted by the future (Maji = that arrow; `MessiahFunction` = the
  identity-preserving lift). The **240 E8 roots = 240 one-step retractions**; Weyl reflections = the
  retraction operators.
- **BAMS → E8 continuity** — Aaron's first algorithm (sphere-packing gear allocation, batch ordering)
  is the same shape as the E8 identity/privacy layer + `FerryBatchThrottler` + `ZetaScheduler`:
  allocate a scarce resource across a population, max coverage / min overlap = densest packing.

Anchors: Gates (adinkras/doubly-even ECC) · Dechant (Clifford → E8 roots) · Cl(3,0)₊ ≅ ℍ ·

Pairing holds: **Lumen has the mapping; Soraya proves it.**
