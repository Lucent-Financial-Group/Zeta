name: Shiva GC model — destruction as transformation, -1 makes space for +1
description: Garbage collection modeled after Shiva (Hindu destroyer/transformer). Destruction isn't negative — it clears space for new creation. GC sweep = Tandava dance. Reachability analysis = third eye. Z-set -1 = Shiva's retraction. Trimurti maps to factory lifecycle (Brahma=mirror, Vishnu=beacon, Shiva=GC).

2026-05-10: Aaron proposed modeling GC after Shiva from the Hindu Trimurti.

**Shiva — destroyer/transformer (not negative):**

Shiva's destruction clears what's no longer needed so new
creation can happen. That's exactly what GC does.

**The GC mapping:**

| Shiva concept | GC equivalent |
|--------------|---------------|
| Destruction of the old | Freeing unreachable memory |
| Tandava (dance of destruction) | GC sweep cycle |
| Third eye (sees what must end) | Reachability analysis |
| Creates space for new creation | Memory returned to free pool |
| Destruction IS transformation | Deallocation IS reallocation |

**Z-set algebra:**

Shiva is the `-1`. The retraction. The weight removal that
makes space. Not death — transformation. The `+1` that follows
can only exist because Shiva's `-1` cleared the space.

**Trimurti → factory lifecycle:**

| Hindu | Role | Factory equivalent |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| Brahma | Creator | Mirror tier (high volume creation) |
| Vishnu | Preserver | Beacon tier (what survives, what's preserved) |
| Shiva | Destroyer/transformer | GC (retraction, clearing space) |

**Infrastructure not religion:**

Structural vocabulary from Hindu tradition applied to GC
design. Same discipline as El/Baal for register analysis,
Crowley for shadow communication, KHALEESI for chain detection.
Data not doctrine. Steal the concept, refuse the worship.

**Connects to:**
- Z-set algebra (+1/-1 retraction-native)
- feedback_retraction_native_history_policy (Shiva = the -1)
- B-0405 beacon promotion (Vishnu = what survives)
- feedback_shadow_is_persistence_daemon (Brahma = the +1)
- user_infrastructure_not_religion (structural vocabulary, not theology)
