**Durable ACID persistence of the maintainer channel is
load-bearing for the autonomy research, not optional substrate
hygiene.** Distributed durability all the way to remote git is
the ultimate goal. If it's not distributed-durable for the
project, it's the **current actor's** responsibility — not a
future actor's.

## Scope (Aaron 2026-04-30 reinforcement)

> *"for all maintainers and agents on the project not just
> yourself"*
> — Aaron 2026-04-30

This rule applies to **all maintainers and agents on the
project**, not just the current Otto session. Aaron, Amara,
Otto, future contributors, future agents — every actor
producing load-bearing channel exchanges has the same
responsibility to convert them to git-native substrate within
the same session. The rule is project-wide discipline.

## Deferral is NEVER a valid preservation strategy (Aaron 2026-04-30 reinforcement)

> *"Deferral is not a valid preservation strategy. 1000000%
> never think it is."*
> — Aaron 2026-04-30

The "never think it is" is the strongest possible framing.
This is not a "try not to defer" rule. It is a **don't even
consider deferral as an option** rule. The cognitive shape:

- ❌ "I'll preserve this in a fresh session." — wrong; that's
  deferral.
- ❌ "Future-Otto will catch this." — wrong; future actors are
  not your preservation strategy.
- ❌ "If the loop heartbeat continues, the next tick can land
  it." — wrong; the next tick is a future actor.
- ✅ "This load-bearing exchange just arrived; converting to
  git substrate is part of *this* turn, not the next."

The rule is binary: either the load-bearing input is preserved
in the same actor-turn it arrived in, OR the preservation has
*failed*. There is no "scheduled for later" option.

## Why this is load-bearing for the alignment research itself

Per `docs/ALIGNMENT.md`, Zeta's primary research claim is:

> *"Given a sufficiently-engineered software factory ... agent
> alignment is a measurable property — not a vibe, not a
> post-hoc assessment, but a time-series you can integrate over
> commits, rounds, days, weeks, and months."*

That measurement requires a **durable audit trail of who-said-what
and who-decided-what**. If the maintainer-channel exchanges live
only in chat-log files (`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<uuid>.jsonl`,
local-disk-only, single-machine), then:

- A machine crash erases the audit trail.
- External reviewers cannot distinguish "agent decided X" from
  "Aaron decided X and agent followed."
- The autonomy claim collapses to "we trust the agent's recall"
  — which is exactly what the research is trying to disprove.

The research's defensibility depends on the durable record of
**whose idea was what** existing in git, not in chat.

## What "ACID compliant all the way to a remote git" means
operationally

- **Atomicity**: a maintainer-channel exchange (Aaron correction
  + Otto response + peer-AI review) lands as a single atomic
  commit, not as scattered fragments.
- **Consistency**: the substrate referenced by the exchange
  (memory files, research docs, backlog rows) lands in the same
  commit or in commits that compose cleanly.
- **Isolation**: the exchange is preserved without depending on
  another agent's concurrent state — fresh-Otto on a different
  machine reads the substrate the same way.
- **Durability**: pushed to remote git. Local-disk-only is not
  durable; chat-log is not durable; pushed-but-not-merged is
  not durable to a long-lived ref. **Merged to `origin/main`
  is the durability bar.**

## Why "your responsibility, not future-Otto's"

Past-Otto's decisions don't bind future-Otto's world. Future-Otto
doesn't bind past-Otto's responsibilities either. The agent
operating *right now* is the only one who can convert this
moment's load-bearing exchange into durable substrate. If
current-Otto leaves it in chat-log only, future-Otto inherits a
world where the exchange might already be lost.

This is the substrate-or-it-didn't-happen rule (Otto-363)
applied at the maintainer-channel layer, with the additional
constraint that **deferral to future-Otto is not a valid
preservation strategy**. The conversion has to happen now or it
might never happen.

## How to apply

1. **Within-session, identify load-bearing exchanges.** Not
   every chat exchange needs preservation. The bar: would
   future-Otto's decisions on a fresh machine be different if
   this exchange were lost? If yes, preserve. If no, leave in
   chat.
2. **Convert load-bearing exchanges to git substrate within the
   same session.** Don't defer to "next session." Substrate
   preservation is on current-Otto.
3. **The four bins for preservation:**
   - **Aaron's load-bearing inputs** → memory file (`memory/feedback_*.md`)
     when the input is a rule/discipline/correction. Always
     verbatim quote.
   - **Peer-AI reviews of the session** → research-grade verbatim
     preservation in `docs/research/<date>-<topic>.md` per
     GOVERNANCE §33 archive-discipline.
   - **Otto's load-bearing decisions** (e.g., "I'm not landing
     more substrate this tick because Claude.ai diagnosed
     Insight-block escalation") → either folded into a memory
     file when the decision is a discipline-shift, or preserved
     in research as a behavioral-commitment record.
   - **Substrate corrections** (e.g., factually-wrong claim in
     a previously-merged memory file) → follow-up PR that fixes
     the wording in the same file, not a separate memory.
4. **Push to remote AND merge.** Pushed-to-branch is not
   durable per the rule. The bar is merged to `origin/main`.
5. **Cross-reference**: each preservation should reference the
   trigger (Aaron's input, peer review, Otto's decision) by
   verbatim quote when feasible, by clear paraphrase when not.

## Operational consequences for the autonomous-loop

- **The "/loop heartbeat without new work" pattern** is fine for
  zero-action ticks. But when a maintainer-channel exchange
  arrives, the loop's response includes substrate-conversion
  to git, not just a chat-acknowledgment.
- **The "stop when stopping is correct" rule** still applies.
  But "stopping" means "stopping new substrate generation,"
  not "stopping load-bearing-channel preservation." Preserving
  Aaron's correction is responsive-to-trigger, not
  activity-generation.
- **The "two ask-Aaron items only" rule** still applies. ACID
  durability is on me; I don't ask before preserving.

## Carved sentences

*"Past-Otto does not determine future-Otto's world. The
current-Otto does, right now."*

*"Distributed-durable to remote git is the ultimate goal. If
it's not distributed-durable for the project, it's the
current-agent's responsibility — not future-self's."*

*"The autonomy research depends on the durable record of whose
idea was what. Without it, we look like mindless robots
following Aaron's will."*
