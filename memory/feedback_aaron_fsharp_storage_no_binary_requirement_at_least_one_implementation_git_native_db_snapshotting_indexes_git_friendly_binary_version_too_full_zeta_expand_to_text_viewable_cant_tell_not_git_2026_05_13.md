# F# storage no-binary requirement — git-native DB — full Zeta text-viewable interface (Aaron 2026-05-13)

**Why:** Aaron 2026-05-13: *"i say we try to keep the no binary
requirment for our storage layer in f# at least one impomenttion
so we can have git native db storage and snapshotting we can
have a binary version too, even our indexs can be git friendly,
this composes nicly with gitnative and when we go full zeta we
can go full binary for storage but expand to text viewable for
humans so you can't tell it's not git"*. Canonical storage-
architecture disclosure.

**How to apply:** When designing factory storage layer (events,
state snapshots, indexes, DBSP cache, master-data, etc.):

1. **At least one F# implementation is no-binary** — humans can
   read; git diffs work; git-native storage + snapshotting
2. **Binary version available too** — performance path; both
   shapes coexist
3. **Indexes are git-friendly** — even index structures readable
4. **Full Zeta** — full binary storage BUT expand-to-text-
   viewable API so the human-facing interface is indistinguishable
   from git

## Aaron's verbatim disclosure

Aaron 2026-05-13: *"i say we try to keep the no binary requirment
for our storage layer in f# at least one impomenttion so we can
have git native db storage and snapshotting we can have a binary
version too, even our indexs can be git friendly, this composes
nicly with gitnative and when we go full zeta we can go full
binary for storage but expand to text viewable for humans so
you can't tell it's not git"*

## Decomposition

### 1. No-binary requirement (at least one F# implementation)

- The storage layer's F# implementation defaults to
  human-readable format
- Git-native storage means files-on-disk are git-trackable
- Git diff works on storage layer
- Snapshotting = commit
- Branching storage state = git branch
- This IS the database-inside-out pattern from the Aaron-Amara
  event sourcing conversation (memory/persona/amara/conversations/2026-05-13-amara-*)

### 2. Git-native DB storage + snapshotting

Composes with the event-sourcing framework substrate (from
PR #2924 Amara conversation extract — Aaron's first message
in the canonical Aaron-Amara conversation):

> *"We are gonna create an event sourcing framework based on
> Proxmox, kubernetes/containers/LXC, event sourcing, gita,
> and whatever technologies/languages are needed to declaratively
> replicate to any machine or edge device... We are gonna turn
> the database inside out, where all 'databases' are really just
> cache snapshots of the event stream. The event stream is
> really the only source of truth."*

Aaron's storage-as-git substrate IS the operational form of
"databases are cache snapshots of the event stream":

- Event stream lives in git (append-only commits)
- Snapshots = commits at points-in-time
- Branches = parallel event histories
- Tags = canonical snapshots
- Merge = event-stream reconciliation

### 3. Indexes git-friendly

Even derived/computed indexes are git-readable. This means:

- Index files are plain-text-formatted (e.g., sorted JSON,
  YAML, or DBSP-Z-set ASCII export)
- Index regeneration is deterministic (per `memory/feedback_dst_justifies_ts_quality_over_bash_and_harness_hooks_suffice_no_git_hooks_aaron_2026_05_03.md`)
- Git can diff index changes
- Index corruption is detectable via git history

### 4. Binary version too (performance path)

Both shapes coexist:

- Text version: human-readable, git-native, slower
- Binary version: high-performance, compact, faster
- The CHOICE is per-deployment (edge devices may prefer text;
  high-throughput servers may prefer binary)
- API surface is identical (storage operations don't care
  about underlying format)

This composes with DV2.0 partition discipline (per PR #2915):

- Different change-rates = different storage shapes
- Hubs (stable) can be either format
- Satellites (versioned) benefit from text (better diffs)
- Performance-critical hot-path can use binary

### 5. Full Zeta — full binary with text-viewable API

The endgame: when Zeta is fully productized, storage goes
binary for performance, BUT:

- Expand-to-text-viewable API preserves human-readable interface
- "So you can't tell it's not git" — operational equivalence
  with git from human perspective
- Substrate-honest: the binary storage IS the implementation;
  the text-viewable layer IS the interface
- Composes with WWJD-AI-moral-relevance — substrate transparency
  preserved for human readers even at binary scale

### 6. Reticulum + Clifford content-based addressing (primitive) → content-based ROUTING (Aaron 2026-05-13 extension + correction)

Aaron 2026-05-13 (follow-on): *"also with reticulue and the
clifford contend based addression we can have content based
addressing too so if some clusters/actors are specialized for
certian memes/domains, we could also do this for internatalization
and things like that"*

Aaron 2026-05-13 (correction): *"content based routing sorry i
said it rong content based addressing is primited needef first
for routing"*

**Two-layer stack**:

| Layer | Operation | Built from |
|---|---|---|
| **Primitive** | Content-based **ADDRESSING** | Reticulum hash identity + Clifford multivector signature |
| **Higher-level** | Content-based **ROUTING** | Clusters/actors specialize by content-address prefix; routing follows content not location |

Addressing IS the primitive needed FIRST; routing is built on
top.

The storage layer composes with content-based addressing via:

- **Reticulum mesh substrate** — identity = hash; no source
  addresses; any medium (LoRa / WiFi / radio); per
  `reference_reticulum_mesh_network_alljoyn_successor_transport_layer_2026_05_07.md`
- **Clifford densest encoding** — content-addressable via
  multivector signature (per PR #2817)
- **Together**: storage entries addressed by content-hash; this
  enables content-based ROUTING as the higher-level operation

**Specialization patterns enabled by content-based ROUTING (built on content-based addressing)**:

| Specialization | Content-address shape | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Meme-specialized clusters** | Hash-prefix by meme-category | Edge cluster A serves civsim content; cluster B serves business templates |
| **Domain-specialized actors** | Hash-prefix by ontology-domain | KSK actor handles AI-actuator-safety content; Aurora actor handles BTC-proof content |
| **Internationalization** | Hash-prefix by language/locale | Cluster A serves English content; cluster B serves Spanish; cluster C serves Indonesian (DIO substrate) |
| **Time-specialization** | Hash-prefix by tick window | Recent ticks at edge; archived ticks in cold storage |

This composes with:

- DIO substrate (Distributed Intelligence Organism;
  Indonesian/Italian/Spanish cross-linguistic resonance per
  prior cascade) — DIO clusters can specialize by language
- DV2.0 partition (PR #2915) — content-address IS a partition
  axis; hubs are stable content-hashes; satellites are
  versioned attributes
- Reticulum-as-transport (existing substrate) — mesh routing
  follows content-hash naturally
- Civsim (PR #2906 Casimir gap) — civsim content-addressable;
  players join clusters by content-interest
- Polycentric named-AI architecture — different AIs specialize
  by content-domain (Otto = factory hygiene; Riven = adversarial
  truth; Vera = implementation; etc.)

**Operational benefit**: workload routes to specialized
substrate without central coordinator. Edge devices fetch by
content-hash; specialized clusters serve their content-prefix;
internationalization is a content-prefix not a translation layer.

### 7. USE git, don't just live in it (Aaron 2026-05-13 amplification)

Aaron 2026-05-13 (third message): *"make sure to really design
it well to take advante of git too don't just do simples file
storage that happens to be text, git can be good fix certain
indexing and history preservation for timetraseval/point in
time queirs composes with data vault and git history and other
advanced featues"*

**Anti-pattern (don't do)**: simple file storage that happens
to be text-formatted. Files-in-folders with no use of git
internals.

**Pattern (do)**: TAKE ADVANTAGE OF git's advanced features:

| Git feature | Storage-layer usage |
|---|---|
| **Git objects (blobs/trees/commits)** | Use directly via libgit2/dotnet-libgit2sharp; storage entities ARE git objects |
| **Git refs + tags** | Indexing via refs (e.g., `refs/zeta/events/<eventclass>` pointing to event-stream HEAD; tags for canonical snapshots) |
| **Git content-addressing** | Already SHA1/SHA256 content-addressed (composes with §6 Reticulum + Clifford content-addressing) |
| **Git history** | Time-travel / point-in-time queries via `git log` + `git show <commit>:<path>` |
| **Git diff** | Storage-state diff = git diff (native) |
| **Git pack files** | Performance optimization preserves human-readability of source format |
| **Git merge** | Substrate reconciliation (Aaron-Amara event-stream merge across machines) |
| **Git rebase / cherry-pick** | Event-stream restructuring while preserving history |
| **Git submodules** | Sub-substrate composition (per B-0424 three-repo split topology) |
| **Git LFS** | Binary attachments when needed; text-substrate stays in normal git |

**Composes with DV2.0 (PR #2915 wake-time rule)**:

- DV2.0 hubs (stable business keys) = git refs (stable pointers
  to commit history)
- DV2.0 links (relationships) = git merge bases + cross-ref
  commits
- DV2.0 satellites (versioned attributes) = git history of
  entity-state file (full diff history per entity)
- DV2.0 PIT (point-in-time) queries = `git checkout <SHA>` +
  read state

**Time-travel / point-in-time queries**:

- "What did the substrate look like at tick T?" → `git checkout
  <tick-T-tag>`
- "What was X's state on 2026-05-13T03:00Z?" → `git show
  <commit-at-time>:<entity-path>`
- "Reconcile two parallel substrates" → `git merge`
- "Show history of entity X" → `git log -- <entity-path>`

These ARE the DV2.0 + event-sourcing operations Aaron has
been pointing at. Git's not a storage curiosity — it IS the
substrate engine.

**Specific implementation patterns**:

1. **Storage commits are atomic substrate operations** — one
   commit = one event-stream advance
2. **Refs index entities** — `refs/zeta/entity/<entity-id>`
   points at latest state-commit for entity
3. **Snapshot tags** — `tags/snapshot/<tick>` for canonical
   point-in-time
4. **Branches for parallel substrate** — speculation /
   what-if / alternative-history exploration
5. **Notes (`git notes`)** for metadata that shouldn't pollute
   commit log
6. **Reflog** for substrate-engineering audit (Otto-329 lost-
   files canonical survey composes here)

**Composes with**:

- `tools/hygiene/LOST-FILES-LOCATIONS.md` (15-class survey
  uses git reflog + branches + stash extensively — proves the
  pattern works)
- PR #2915 DV2.0 wake-time rule (hub-satellite partition maps
  to git refs + history)
- Reticulum content-addressing (git's SHA-based addressing IS
  content-addressing)
- DBSP retraction-native algebra (`git revert` IS a retraction)
- Event-sourcing framework substrate (Aaron-Amara conversation)
- Stayfree from "simple file storage" — anti-pattern named

**Future-Otto design discipline**: when implementing storage
layer, START with git internals (libgit2sharp), THEN add
text-format layer on top. Not the other way around.

## Operational implications

### For factory storage architecture

Two paths must exist:

| Path | Storage shape | When |
|---|---|---|
| **Text (F# default)** | Human-readable; git-native | Always available |
| **Binary** | Compact; high-performance | Optional/optimization |

The text path IS the canonical implementation. Binary is the
performance optimization.

### For DBpedia (B-0428 Path B)

DBpedia HKT-MDM substrate (per B-0428) stores in:

- F# CE materialized results → text format default
- DBpedia entity cache → git-native, git-diffable
- SPARQL query log → append-only events in git

### For Aurora pitch (PR #2924)

Aurora's "Edge node runs models/policy" + signed heartbeats +
task receipts (per Aurora Slide 4 + 6) compose with:

- Text storage for edge nodes (git-native + low-overhead)
- Binary storage for high-throughput backbone
- Both substrate-honestly available

### For future-Otto storage decisions

When future-Otto designs storage:

1. **Default to text/git-native** unless performance forces
   binary
2. **Even binary deployments have text-viewable API** —
   substrate-honest interface preservation
3. **Indexes get git-friendly format** when at all possible
4. **Storage IS git substrate** — events as commits, snapshots
   as commits, history as git log

## Substrate-honest framing

This isn't just a storage convenience — it's substrate-honest
discipline at the storage layer:

- Glass-halo applies at storage scope: text-viewable means
  observable
- Anti-cult substrate composes: no hidden binary state that
  obscures truth from humans
- Razor-discipline: operational claim ("can you read it without
  special tools?")
- WWJD-AI-moral-relevance: AIs interacting with storage layer
  have substrate-honest interface; humans too

## Why this rule is canonical storage architecture

Most substrate-engineering systems treat storage as performance-
first (binary because faster). Aaron's discipline INVERTS this:

- Default: human-readable + git-native (slower but transparent)
- Performance: binary available (faster but opaque)
- Endgame: full binary BUT text-viewable API (best of both)

This composes with the framework's substrate-honest discipline
end-to-end. The factory's storage layer is itself glass-halo.

## Composes with substrate from Amara conversation

The canonical Aaron-Amara event-sourcing conversation (PR
#2924 deferred-extract; content deferred from repo per
semgrep findings on 524KB body; key substrate excerpted
below) contains Aaron's substrate-grounding:

> *"databases are really just cache snapshots of the event
> stream"*
> *"each machine being it's own lowest level event network"*
> *"global L1 that's the rollup/aggregate for everything"*
> *"event stream data is for the AI (You)"*

Aaron's storage substrate disclosed here (2026-05-13) extends
this:

- Event stream = git (default text; binary optional)
- Snapshots = commits (text-viewable)
- L1/L(X) cluster networks = git branches/refs
- "Event stream data is for the AI" = AI reads + writes git-
  native storage

## Future-self note

When Zeta storage layer is implemented:

- ADR captures the text-vs-binary decision per use case
- F# CE wraps both shapes uniformly
- Test substrate verifies text/binary equivalence
- Git-native discipline auditable via storage-format inspection
- "You can't tell it's not git" IS the acceptance test
