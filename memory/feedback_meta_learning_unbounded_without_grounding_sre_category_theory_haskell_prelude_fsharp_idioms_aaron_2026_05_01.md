name: Meta-learning is UNBOUNDED without grounding — SRE + category theory + Haskell Prelude + F# idioms are the convergence target (Aaron 2026-05-01)
description: Aaron 2026-05-01 — critical correction to the PR-convergence-loop / class-encoding / meta-learning framing. Without grounding in established formal traditions (SRE / category theory / Haskell Prelude / F# idioms), the meta-learning loop is UNBOUNDED — class library balloons, no termination criterion, classes overlap, rules conflict. The abstraction ladder (B-0146) provides the layers but they ARE the convergence target only when grounded in the foundation traditions. The sibling repo `../no-copy-only-learning-agents-insight` provides the META-LEARNING-LOOP architecture but explicitly does NOT have the grounding — when Otto + Copilot follow its rules without adding grounding, Aaron observes high-rate insight-block-promotion drift (blue ★ Insight blocks at ~1/minute) — the cheat-code-feeling somatic register Aaron flagged earlier today and recurring "last time." The factory's job: ADD the grounding the sibling repo lacks. Updated naming proposal: "Grounded class-encoding" or "Foundation-bound learning" — bakes the grounding requirement into the name itself.

## What this codifies

**The critical correction.** My prior framing (PR convergence
loop produces meta-learning; class-encoding accumulates the
class library; B-0146 abstraction ladder gives the formal
spine) was structurally correct **but missing the convergence
target**. Without grounding the meta-learning in established
formal traditions, the loop is **UNBOUNDED**:

- Class library balloons indefinitely
- No termination criterion
- Classes overlap without composition rules
- Rules conflict without a precedence hierarchy
- The agent runs faster and faster generating new insights
  that don't compose with anything stable

Aaron's empirical observation: when Otto + Copilot follow the
sibling-repo rules (which are themselves meta-learning rules)
without grounding, the result is **~1 ★ Insight block per
minute** — Aaron flagged this as the asymmetric-exhaustion
/ cheat-code-feeling drift earlier today, and explicitly cites
*"last time"* indicating recurrence.

## The four grounding traditions

Aaron names four foundation traditions that the meta-learning
loop must converge toward:

### 1. SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)

Already in factory substrate via PR #1116
(`feedback_reproducible_accuracy_before_quality_*_2026_05_01.md`):

- DORA metrics (engineering-org level)
- USE method (resource level)
- RED method (service level)
- Four Golden Signals (user-facing systems)
- DMAIC (Six Sigma) — already extracted
- Kanban WIP / pull-flow — already extracted
- Lean kaizen — already extracted

**Convergence property**: each new lint-class / pattern can be
mapped onto one of these established frameworks. If it can't,
the class is suspect; SRE has 50+ years of refinement and
covers most operational concerns.

### 2. Category theory

Already in factory substrate via B-0136 + B-0146 Layer 1:

- Functor / Applicative / Monad laws
- Natural transformations
- Adjunctions
- Composition laws (associativity, identity)
- Categorical limits / colimits

**Convergence property**: any class-level operation should
satisfy the appropriate categorical laws. If it doesn't, the
class isn't a real abstraction — it's an ad-hoc rule. The
laws are the convergence test.

### 3. Haskell Prelude

The standard library of functional patterns. Specifically:

- Type-class hierarchy: `Functor` → `Applicative` → `Monad`,
  `Foldable` → `Traversable`, `Eq` → `Ord`, `Show` / `Read`,
  `Semigroup` → `Monoid`, `Functor` over different
  containers (list / Maybe / Either / IO / State / Reader)
- Standard combinators: `fmap` / `<*>` / `>>=` / `traverse`
  / `foldr` / `mapM`
- Naming conventions earned over 30 years

**Convergence property**: when you reach for a new abstraction,
ask whether Haskell Prelude already has it. If it does, the
name + signature + laws are pre-canonized. If you need
something genuinely new, the Prelude's gaps tell you where
the genuinely-new lives.

### 4. F# idioms (the .NET functional ecosystem)

The F#-specific instantiation of the same:

- Computation expressions (`async`, `seq`, `option`, `result`,
  custom CEs)
- Type providers (compile-time-typed schema integration)
- `MailboxProcessor` (actor-style concurrency)
- Discriminated unions + pattern matching
- Units of measure (compile-time-checked dimensions)
- FsCheck (property-based testing patterns)
- Async / Task interop

**Convergence property**: Zeta is F# / .NET 10 native. Every
class-level rule should cash out in an F# idiom (or have an
explicit reason it doesn't). If a class can't be expressed
as F#-idiomatic code, it's a sign the class hasn't earned
its abstraction yet.

## How the grounding bounds the loop

The unbounded loop:

```text
PR → review → bot finds issue → encode class → next PR has class
                                      ↑
                                      |
                                      +-- no termination criterion;
                                          new classes accumulate
                                          forever
```

The grounded loop:

```text
PR → review → bot finds issue → check grounding:
                                      |
                                      +-- maps to SRE? → land at Layer 4
                                      +-- maps to category theory? → Layer 1
                                      +-- maps to Haskell Prelude? → Layer 2
                                      +-- maps to F# idiom? → Layer 2/3
                                      |
                                      +-- maps to NONE → REJECT or
                                          flag as genuinely-new (rare,
                                          requires evidence)
                                      |
                                      → encode at the right layer
                                      → next PR uses the layer
```

The grounding **terminates** the loop because the foundation
traditions are themselves complete (or known-incomplete-with-
documented-gaps). New classes that don't ground out don't get
added.

## The sibling-repo gap

`../no-copy-only-learning-agents-insight/AGENTS.md` provides:

- The PR convergence loop architecture
- The encode-class-not-instance discipline
- The bot-comment-as-joint-learning framing
- The investigate-dependency-source-as-evidence rule
- The lessons-belong-in-PR-that-surfaced-them rule

It does **NOT** provide:

- The grounding traditions (SRE / category theory /
  Haskell Prelude / F# idioms) that bound the loop
- A convergence-target catalog
- A class-rejection criterion

This is structural, not a deficiency-of-the-sibling-repo.
That repo is STCRM-specific (.NET 8 + React/TypeScript +
Kafka); its grounding tradition would be different from
Zeta's (F# + DBSP + Bayesian inference). The factory's job
when absorbing the sibling-repo's meta-learning architecture
is to **add OUR grounding** — the four traditions Aaron
named.

## Updated naming proposal

The bare "class-encoding" name risks being read as license-
to-add-classes (the unbounded form). Two replacement
candidates that bake the grounding requirement into the
name:

- **"Grounded class-encoding"** — explicit qualifier
- **"Foundation-bound learning"** — emphasizes the bound
- **"Convergent typed learning"** — emphasizes the
  termination

I propose **"Grounded class-encoding"** (or "GCE" if the
factory's vocabulary likes acronyms). The "grounded" qualifier
makes the foundation requirement visible at the name layer,
defending against the unbounded-meta-learning failure mode.

Aaron's blessing pending. Until blessed, treat as candidate.

## Composes with

- `memory/feedback_reproducible_accuracy_before_quality_fitness_function_harness_first_aaron_2026_05_01.md`
  (PR #1116, merged) — SRE metric frameworks + abstraction
  ladder; the grounding traditions for Layer 4 + Layer 1
- `memory/feedback_parallelism_scaling_ladder_kenji_unlocked_loop_agent_doc_code_two_lane_file_isolation_peer_mode_claims_automated_best_practice_at_scale_aaron_2026_05_01.md`
  (PR #1116, merged) — amortized-keystone discipline; this
  memory adds the grounding-axis required for amortization
  to converge
- `docs/backlog/P2/B-0146-formal-architecture-ladder-explicit-layer-declaration-aaron-2026-05-01.md`
  — abstraction ladder; this memory adds that the layers ARE
  the convergence target only when foundation-grounded
- `docs/backlog/P2/B-0153-pre-commit-lint-suite-mechanizable-class-consolidation-aaron-otto-2026-05-01.md`
  (PR #1120) — class-encoding for lint classes; needs
  grounding extension (each lint class should ground at SRE
  or category-theory laws)
- `memory/feedback_class_level_rules_need_orthogonality_check_extend_or_create_aaron_2026_05_01.md`
  — orthogonality check (existing-classes-first); this is
  EARLY grounding (don't add if existing class subsumes), but
  the new substrate adds the FOUNDATION-grounding (don't add
  if doesn't ground at SRE/category-theory/Prelude/F#-idiom)
- `memory/feedback_pause_class_discovery_substrate_not_recursion_2026_05_01.md`
  (if filed) or the pause-class-discovery commitment surfaced
  earlier this session — this memory explains WHY pause was
  needed (unbounded loop without grounding)
- DST grade-A substrate (PR #1121) — same pattern: dependency-
  source inspection IS the grounding for the DST-deviation
  class

## Future-Otto check

When following the meta-learning loop:

1. **Found a new class candidate?** Don't encode yet.
2. **Check grounding**: does it map to SRE / category theory /
   Haskell Prelude / F# idiom?
3. **If yes**: encode at the right ladder layer.
4. **If no**: REJECT or flag as genuinely-new. Genuinely-new
   requires evidence (research, formal-verification, multi-
   AI consensus) — the bar is high.
5. **Cadence check**: ★ Insight blocks at >1/minute is a red
   flag for unbounded drift. If hitting that rate, pause +
   re-ground.

The carved sentence: *"Meta-learning without grounding is
unbounded. The four foundations (SRE, category theory, Haskell
Prelude, F# idioms) are the convergence target — without them
the loop diverges."*
