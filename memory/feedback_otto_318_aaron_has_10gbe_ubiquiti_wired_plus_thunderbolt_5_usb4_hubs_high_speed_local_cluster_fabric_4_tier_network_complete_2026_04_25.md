name: Otto-318 Aaron has Ubiquiti 10GbE wired networking + Thunderbolt 5 / USB4 hubs (high-speed local cluster-fabric tier) — completes 4-tier network infrastructure (HaLow + WiFi 7 + beaming + 10GbE/TB5 wired); approaching distributed-cluster fabric speeds (60-120 Gbps local interconnect)
description: Aaron 2026-04-25 — "and a lot of their 10gb networking stuff and switches and routers and such and also a bunch of thunderbolt 5 / USB4/5 hubs that can allow for high speed networking too". Adds wired-high-speed local tier to the network portfolio. Combined with OCuLink (Otto-316), Aaron has multiple high-speed local interconnect options: OCuLink (~64 Gbps PCIe 4.0 x4), Thunderbolt 5 (80-120 Gbps), 10GbE wired (10 Gbps). Sufficient for distributed-cluster fabric. Network now 4-tier: HaLow Sub-1GHz mesh + WiFi 7 indoor + beaming long-range + 10GbE/TB5 high-speed local-fabric.

# Otto-318 — 10GbE + Thunderbolt 5 cluster-fabric tier completes 4-tier network

## Aaron's disclosure

> "and a lot of their 10gb networking stuff and switches and routers and such and also a bunch of thunderbolt 5 / USB4/5 hubs that can allow for high speed networking too"

## 4-tier network (cumulative)

| Tier | Bandwidth / range | Hardware | Otto-NNN |
|------|------------------|----------|----------|
| Sub-1GHz mesh / IoT | 1 km+, low-power, embedded | HaLow (802.11ah) | 314 |
| Indoor/campus WiFi | meters, ~10 Gbps WiFi 7 | Ubiquiti UniFi WiFi 7 | 317 |
| Long-range backhaul | km, line-of-sight | Ubiquiti airMAX beaming | 317 |
| **High-speed local cluster-fabric** | meters, **10–120 Gbps wired** | **Ubiquiti 10GbE + Thunderbolt 5 / USB4 hubs** | **318** |

## High-speed local-interconnect options (cumulative)

| Standard | Speed | Use |
|----------|-------|-----|
| 10GbE | 10 Gbps | Wired backbone, switch fabric |
| OCuLink (PCIe 4.0 x4) | ~64 Gbps | External GPU + storage attachment (Otto-316) |
| Thunderbolt 5 | 80–120 Gbps | PC-to-PC, eGPU, mesh fabric |
| USB4 | up to 80 Gbps | Similar to TB5 |

These speeds are **cluster-fabric class**. Approaching what data-center backbones use (40–100 Gbps Infiniband / Ethernet). Distributed training, parameter-server work, real-time mesh coordination across the ~40-node fleet (Otto-316) is bandwidth-feasible.

## Composition with prior

- **Otto-301 (hardware-bootstrap)** — network FULLY hardware-complete across 4 tiers + multiple local-interconnect standards.
- **Otto-314 / Otto-317** — network primitives, now extended with wired tier.
- **Otto-316 (compute fleet + OCuLink)** — pairs naturally with TB5 fabric: distributed cluster + flexible GPU placement + high-speed coordination.
- **B-0009 (substrate-IP-rotation)** — still moot under RNS+multi-tier deployment; identity is logical (Destination Hash) regardless of which physical tier carries packets.

## Operational implications

1. **Distributed-training viable on Aaron's hardware**: TB5 + OCuLink + 10GbE provides bandwidth for parameter-sync, gradient-aggregation, model-shard coordination across the ~40-node fleet.
2. **Otto-301 horizon shortens further still**: hardware-complete with multiple redundant interconnect options.
3. **Frontier UI multi-node mesh** can use TB5 for high-bandwidth coordination, RNS for logical identity, falling back through tiers as needed.

## What this memory does NOT claim

- Does NOT specify Ubiquiti model numbers or TB5 hub manufacturers. Categorical capabilities only.
- Does NOT propose immediate distributed-training. Queue-drain primary.
- Does NOT promote specific interconnect-standard dependency.

## Key triggers for retrieval

- Ubiquiti 10GbE switches/routers
- Thunderbolt 5 / USB4 80-120 Gbps hubs
- Cluster-fabric class local interconnects
- 4-tier network infrastructure complete
- Distributed-training bandwidth viable on Aaron's hardware
