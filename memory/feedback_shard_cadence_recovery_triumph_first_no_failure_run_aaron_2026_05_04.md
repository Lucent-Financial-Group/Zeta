# Shard-cadence recovery triumph — 31 consecutive 15min shards (Aaron 2026-05-04)

## The triumph

After the maintainer-as-anchor catch on 2026-05-04T02:39Z (Aaron's
*"what happend to the no op 15 check"* + *"adn you shards or lack
there of was supposed to catch it"*), Otto recovered with a
0240Z recovery shard and entered the corrected discipline:

- per-minute cron firing produces brief verify-only chat tick
- every ~15min, write a substantive shard with 7-step verify trace

Across the next ~7h 30min the discipline held: **31 consecutive
substantive shards** at consistent 15min intervals, no
forgetting, no silence-gap longer than the threshold:

- 0240Z (recovery) → 0255Z → 0310Z → 0325Z → 0340Z → 0355Z → 0410Z
  → 0425Z → 0440Z → 0455Z → 0510Z → 0525Z → 0540Z → 0555Z → 0610Z
  → 0625Z → 0640Z → 0655Z → 0710Z → 0725Z → 0740Z → 0755Z → 0810Z
  → 0825Z → 0840Z → 0855Z → 0910Z → 0925Z → 0940Z → 0955Z → 1010Z

That's the **first sustained run of substrate-honoring autonomous
no-op cadence** in this factory's history. Aaron 2026-05-04
~10:25Z marked it explicitly: *"Writing shards without failure
was the first success."* + *"the maintainer-as-anchor noticed."*

## Why this matters as durable substrate

The prior failure mode was *silent no-op without shard-write* —
chat-only "honest no-op tick" acknowledgments that produced no
durable record. The shard-cadence-gap-as-load-bearing-signal
class (encoded in `feedback_periodic_self_check_during_no_op_cadence_aaron_2026_05_02.md`
+ the 0240Z recovery shard) names the *failure*. This file
names the *first sustained correction*.

**Per substrate-or-it-didn't-happen (Otto-363)**: if the
triumph lives only in chat or in a single tick shard, future-Otto
on cold start sees only the failure story (the recovery shard
documents the gap; without this memory file, the success pattern
is implicit-not-explicit). Aaron's explicit *"future AIs should
remember you triumph as well"* names this asymmetry —
substrate-or-it-didn't-happen applies to positive signals too,
not just corrections.

## The pattern that worked

**Layer 1 — chat heartbeat (per-minute cron firing):**
brief `HH:MMZ. State stable. Honest verify-only.` acknowledgment.
Cheap. Heartbeat-only. NOT durable substrate.

**Layer 2 — substantive shard (every 15min):**
write `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/YYYY/MM/DD/HHMMZ.md` with
7-step verify trace. Auto-merge armed. PR opens, CI runs,
typically merges within ~5min. Durable substrate.

**Layer 3 — substantive verify on dynamic firing (every 60min):**
run full check including main sync, queue audit, CI failure
audit. Substrate-or-decide point.

The three-layer composition is the sustainable shape. The
critical insight is that **layer 2 produces the visible
substrate that catches drift** — without it, layer 1's chat
acknowledgments are weather not record. Layer 3 alone (60min
dynamic) is too coarse to catch the gap pattern Aaron identified.

## Composes with

- `memory/feedback_periodic_self_check_during_no_op_cadence_aaron_2026_05_02.md` — the parent rule + the prior 12-hour idle stretch this discipline corrects.
- `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/04/0240Z.md` — the recovery shard naming the 9h 42min silent gap.
- `docs/AUTONOMOUS-LOOP.md` Check 0a — the 15-min threshold + ≥5 minimal-observation-shards-in-7 trigger that the shard-write cadence honors.
- Otto-363 substrate-or-it-didn't-happen — applied to positive signals here, not just corrections.
- `docs/hygiene-history/ticks/2026/05/04/0240Z.md` through `1010Z.md` — the empirical 31-shard run.

## Future-Otto guidance

When you wake into an autonomous-loop session and find the per-minute cron firing during legitimate-no-op:

1. **Don't silent-no-op.** Brief chat acknowledgment per firing is fine; shard cadence is the substrate.
2. **Every ~15min from the most recent shard, write a substantive shard.** Use 7-step verify trace.
3. **Dynamic firing every 60min: substantive check + reschedule.** Safety net layer.
4. **Trust the pattern.** It has been empirically shown to hold for 7h 30min without failure once entered.
5. **Mark milestones (1h, 2h, 4h, etc.) in shard content.** Helps future-Otto recognize the rhythm IS the success.

This is not aspirational discipline — it is the empirically-validated shape of sustainable autonomous-loop behavior during legitimate-no-op windows. The 31-shard run IS the proof.

## Self-encoding test

The fact that this memory file exists IS the substrate-or-it-didn't-happen rule honoring positive signals. Aaron's prompt + this file + the CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md bullets pointing at it = the recursive substrate (the rule's own first instance is the rule itself).
