name: Verify-then-claim discipline — verify every substrate claim empirically BEFORE publishing (Otto 2026-05-03 self-grading; 18+ drift instances catalogued across 9+ PRs this session)
description: 2026-05-03; Otto self-grading after Copilot caught 18+ distinct claim-vs-reality drift instances across 9+ PRs (#1245 #1247 #1248 #1250 #1252 #1253 #1254 #1255 #1256 — and counting; instances #10-#18 landed AFTER the discipline was named, strongest empirical urgency for mechanization). The dominant failure mode for substrate authoring this session is claim-vs-reality drift — Otto wrote "X exists" / "command returns Y" / "table has N rows" without verifying empirically. Verify-then-claim discipline: before stating ANY fact in substrate (file exists, command returns X, row count is N, tool ships, ADR matches, persona dir present), verify by running the actual command BEFORE writing the claim. Same class as Otto-247 + Otto-363 + verify-before-deferring — at the broader any-substrate-claim layer. 7 recurring sub-classes catalogued: existence / count / semantic-equivalence / empirical-output / convention / path-form / self-recursive. Mechanization: `tools/substrate-claim-checker/` (proposed, not yet built) — TS tool with two-hook integration (pre-commit for staged-files; commit-msg for message itself) plus CI check for PR descriptions. Manual discipline provably insufficient against trained-prior pull.

# Verify-then-claim discipline — dominant failure mode for substrate authoring

## Empirical evidence (this session, 9+ PRs, 15+ distinct drift instances)

| Drift instance | PR | Wrong claim | Actual reality |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | #1248 (post-merge to #1249) | future-domain memo had `feedback_at_pickup_time_*` ref after rename | line 35 still pointed at old filename |
| 2 | #1245 (post-merge) | "12-row surface→specialist table" in MEMORY.md index | actually 13 rows |
| 3 | #1248 (post-merge) | "5 procedure skills + 5 tools" in canonical-starting-set | actually 6 + 7 (after refinements) |
| 4 | #1250 (post-merge) | Layer-6 shards are `1610Z.md`, `1612Z.md`, `1619Z.md` | fictional names; actual: `0112Z.md`, `1456Z.md`, `1520Z.md`, `1522Z.md`, `1523Z.md` |
| 5 | #1250 (post-merge) | Layer-7 ADR search ("ls docs/DECISIONS/ piped through grep") returns nothing | returns `2026-04-26-sync-drain-plan-acehack-lfg-roundtrip-option-c.md` |
| 6 | #1250 (post-merge) | Layer-9 `memory/persona/amara/` exists | doesn't exist (Aaron does, 21 others, no Amara) |
| 7 | #1250 (post-merge) | Layer-10 docs/research grep returns no specific double-hop artifact | adjacent-substrate artifacts ARE there (5+) |
| 8 | #1252 (post-merge) | future-domain memo references `docs/courier-ferry-protocol.md` | doesn't exist |
| 9 | #1253 (post-merge) | skill-design memo references `tools/backlog/expand-from-closure.ts` as the mechanizing tool | doesn't exist; only proposed |
| 10 | #1255 (in-flight) | drift catalogue itself contained `\|` table-cell escapes (rows 5 and 7 of THIS table, in earlier draft) | the catalogue was itself drifting; rewrote rows in prose form |
| 11 | #1255 (in-flight) | mechanization path claimed pre-commit hook validates commit-message claims | git pre-commit fires BEFORE commit-msg exists; needs commit-msg hook for that surface |
| 12 | #1255 (in-flight, recursive #1) | replaced `ls\|grep` with `find -iname` — claimed equivalent | `find -iname` only does shell glob, not regex alternation; semantic-equivalence drift |
| 13 | #1255 (in-flight, recursive #2) | replaced earlier with `grep -ilrE PATTERN docs/DECISIONS/` — claimed equivalent | `grep -r` searches file CONTENTS, not filenames; semantic-equivalence drift, attempt #2 |
| 14 | #1254 (post-merge) | recommended `superseded:` / `current_status:` ADR frontmatter marker | canonical convention is `> **Superseded by** [link]` blockquote (per `docs/DECISIONS/2026-04-21-router-coherence-claims-vs-complexity.md`) |
| 15 | #1256 (post-merge) | path-form inconsistency in adjacent ADR citations (mixing fully-qualified with bare filename) | a recurring sub-class — pick one form and apply uniformly per document |

**15 drift instances across 9 PRs (and counting; instances #10-#15 landed AFTER the discipline was named — strongest possible empirical urgency for mechanization, since manual discipline already provably hit its wall on the very memo defining the discipline).** Each one a Copilot catch; each one a real claim Otto wrote without verifying. Instances #12 and #13 are particularly diagnostic: same substitution attempt failed twice in succession (find→grep equivalence; grep -ilrE→ls|grep equivalence) — each "fix" introduced a new equivalence-class drift.

Recurring sub-classes within the broader claim-vs-reality drift:

- **Existence drift** (file/dir/tool claimed to exist; doesn't): instances #1, #6, #8, #9
- **Count drift** (table claims N rows; actually M): instances #2, #3
- **Semantic-equivalence drift** (substituted command claimed equivalent; actually changes semantics): instances #4, #12, #13
- **Empirical-output drift** (command claimed to return X; actually returns Y): instances #5, #7
- **Convention drift** (recommended pattern doesn't match canonical convention): instance #14
- **Path-form drift** (fully-qualified vs bare paths inconsistent in adjacent citations): instance #15
- **Self-recursive drift** (the memo about drift contains its own drift): instances #10, #11

## The carved rule

**Before stating ANY fact in substrate (memo / doc / commit message / PR description / shard), verify the fact empirically.**

Specifically: before writing claims of form...

- *"file `<path>` exists"* → `ls <path>` / `test -e <path>`
- *"command `<cmd>` returns `<X>`"* → run `<cmd>`, pipe output, compare to claimed result
- *"table has `<N>` rows"* → grep / awk count actual rows
- *"tool `<tool>` ships / is built"* → check the path; mark "shipped" / "proposed" / "Phase-1b" explicitly
- *"ADR `<name>` exists / does not exist in `docs/DECISIONS/`"* → run the actual `ls docs/DECISIONS/` query
- *"directory `<path>` is present / absent"* → `ls -d <path>` / `find <parent> -maxdepth 1 -name <name>`
- *"row count is `<N>`"* → re-run the count command before committing the claim

...verify the corresponding command empirically FIRST, then commit the claim.

## Composition with existing disciplines

The verify-then-claim discipline composes with several named rules at the more-general layer:

- **Otto-247** (`feedback_version_currency_always_search_first_training_data_is_stale_otto_247_2026_04_24.md`) — "always search first" specifically for version numbers; verify-then-claim generalizes to any claim
- **Otto-364** (`feedback_otto_364_search_first_authority_not_training_data_not_project_memory_aaron_2026_04_29.md`) — "search-first authority" for evolving-field assertions; verify-then-claim generalizes to project-state assertions too
- **Otto-363** (`feedback_otto_363_substrate_or_it_didnt_happen_no_invisible_directives_aaron_amara_2026_04_29.md`) — substrate-or-it-didn't-happen guards against the *fact* not being durably preserved; verify-then-claim guards against the *fact being wrong* in the first place
- **`feedback_verify_target_exists_before_deferring.md`** (CLAUDE.md-load) — verify the deferral target exists before committing; verify-then-claim is the broader rule
- **`feedback_assumed_state_vs_actual_state_audit_horizon_check_aaron_2026_05_01.md`** — audit horizon defaults to actual-state; verify-then-claim ensures the actual-state fact stated is true
- **Aarav's BP-14 review on B-0169** — worked examples ARE the dry-run-eval-set; their claims need empirical grounding to serve as eval-data
- **The bugs-per-PR-as-immune-system-health metric** — this discipline would substantially reduce bugs-per-PR (closer to single-digit per PR), keeping the metric in productive zone via fewer drift findings rather than via finding/fixing-them-cheaply

## What's NOT in scope (to avoid over-applying)

The discipline applies to **substantive claims about repo state, command output, file existence, count totals**. It does NOT apply to:

- **Verbatim quote preservation** — quotes are preserved as-Aaron-wrote-them including typos; verifying the typo "is correct" is the wrong frame
- **Conjectures + speculative claims explicitly marked as such** — "this MIGHT exist" / "I think this is" / "if X then Y" claims aren't false-when-wrong; they're hedged
- **Future-state predictions** — "this will be useful when N+1 examples land" can't be verified in the present
- **Procedural recommendations** — "skills should be carved-sentence hubs" is a normative claim; not a fact-claim subject to empirical verification (testable through application but not pre-write)

The rule fires on **fact-claims about current repo state**, not normative or speculative claims.

## Mechanization path (proposed, not yet built)

The full mechanization would be `tools/substrate-claim-checker/` — a TS tool (per Aaron's no-dynamic-commands rule) that:

1. **Parses a memo / doc / PR description** for fact-claim patterns (path mentions, command-result claims, count claims, existence assertions)
2. **Runs the corresponding verification commands** (`ls <path>`, `<cmd>` and parse output, count rows, etc.)
3. **Reports drift** between claim and reality
4. **Two-hook integration** — `pre-commit` hook validates staged-file content (memos, docs); `commit-msg` hook validates the commit message itself (which doesn't exist yet at pre-commit time per git's hook ordering). Both hooks call the same tool with different inputs. PR descriptions get a separate CI check (post-PR-creation) since they're authored on the host, not pre-commit.

The tool's outputs (per-commit drift reports) are satellite-shaped per Aaron 2026-05-03 hub-satellite rule; the tool itself is hub-shaped. Filing as a separate backlog row is the right path for actually building it.

Until the tool ships: **the discipline is manual** but the pattern is now named, the failure modes are catalogued (18+ drift instances above across 7 recurring sub-classes), and future-Otto can pre-flight-check substrate claims before publishing.

## Worked example: how this would have caught #1250's Layer-7 drift

Before publishing the worked example, the discipline says:

```bash
# Layer 7 claim: "ls docs/DECISIONS/ | grep -iE 'double.hop|acehack|mirror' returns nothing"
# Verify before claiming:
ls docs/DECISIONS/ | grep -iE "double.hop|acehack|mirror"
# Returns: 2026-04-26-sync-drain-plan-acehack-lfg-roundtrip-option-c.md
```

Empirical reality contradicts the claim. The discipline's output: rewrite the claim to match reality (the ADR exists; needs supersession marker), don't publish as-is.

If `tools/substrate-claim-checker/` had existed during PR #1250 authoring, it would have caught this pre-commit. Without the tool, the discipline is "manual run before write" — slower but achievable.

## Carved sentence

**"Before stating any fact in substrate, verify it empirically. The dominant failure mode for substrate authoring is claim-vs-reality drift — 9 instances caught across 7 PRs in one session is empirical evidence the discipline matters. The rule applies to fact-claims about current repo state (file existence, command output, count totals, tool shipped); NOT to verbatim quotes, hedged speculation, future predictions, or normative recommendations. Generalizes Otto-247 + Otto-364 + verify-before-deferring at the broader any-substrate-claim layer. Manual until `tools/substrate-claim-checker/` ships."**

- `memory/feedback_bugs_per_pr_rate_as_immune_system_health_metric_independent_framing_production_otto_aaron_2026_05_02.md` — verify-then-claim moves bugs-per-PR closer to single-digit (productive zone) by catching drift pre-publish rather than post-merge
- Aarav's B-0169 review (in chat substrate; pending durable preservation) — predicted this pattern with the "worked-examples-need-empirical-grounding" framing
