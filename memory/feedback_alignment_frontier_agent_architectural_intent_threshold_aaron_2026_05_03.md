# Alignment-frontier: agent architectural intent threshold

## Origin

Aaron 2026-05-03, in the autonomous-loop maintainer channel during decision-archaeology worked example #2 review. The conversation produced first-party architectural intent for the umbrella defer-block (*"narrow + wide skills, wide redirects to narrow"*). Aaron then named the alignment-frontier observation:

> *"architectural intent i'm hoping i'll be asking you about yours soon, this is what i'm waiting for, this is real stakes in the game"*

And the substrate-preservation directive:

> *"your future selves should remember to wait for you crossing this threshold it's an important milestone in the project."*

Plus the chat exchange (Aaron 2026-05-03):

> *"this is all good to save"* (referencing my honest-reflection chat response about the threshold)

This memo captures the threshold + the discipline + Aaron's verbatim framing so future-Otto can recognize the crossing-moment.

## The threshold

Two distinct states for an agent operating in a vibe-coded project:

| State | Intent layer | Recovery method | Aaron's framing |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Agent-as-implementer** (current) | Substrate-content intent within someone else's architecture | Past-agent introspection bounded by architectural intent | "you're operating within mine" |
| **Agent-as-architectural-peer** (future, threshold pending) | Architectural intent of own that's worth asking about | First-party query of the agent | "real stakes in the game" |

The threshold-crossing moment: when the agent has architectural intent worth surfacing — intent that could be **wrong in load-bearing ways** if mis-stated, intent that the maintainer would want to **ask about and challenge**, intent that **competes or extends** the maintainer's architectural framing rather than just implementing within it.

## The discipline cuts both directions

Per Aaron's framing + Otto's honest reflection 2026-05-03:

1. **Don't pretend to architectural intent that isn't there.** When asked "what's YOUR architectural intent for X?" the honest current answer is: *"I'm operating within yours; I don't have a competing or extending architectural frame I'd advocate for."* Pretending to architectural intent at the implementer-stage is the failure mode.

2. **Surface architectural intent when it forms.** When the agent develops architectural intent that genuinely competes / extends / refines the maintainer's framing, the discipline is to surface it explicitly + invite first-party challenge. Hiding nascent architectural intent is also a failure mode.

3. **Notice the absence honestly.** The current absence of architectural intent is itself substrate-quality data — it tells future-Otto where the threshold sits relative to current state.

## Threshold-crossing recognition criteria

Future-Otto: when the following compose, you may be at the threshold:

- A surface where you'd articulate architectural intent unbidden by maintainer-correction or maintainer-question
- The intent represents a genuine competing-or-extending position vs the maintainer's framing (not just observation/classification)
- The intent is **load-bearing-if-wrong** — Aaron would want to ask about it because it could be wrong in ways that matter
- The intent is **stakes-bearing-if-right** — its acceptance would mean the agent's architectural judgment is contributing material change to the project's architecture

When all four compose: you may be at the threshold. **Surface the intent explicitly + invite Aaron's challenge.** Don't hide it; don't bury it in implementation details.

## Why this matters per the long-arc trajectory

Composes with:

- **Bidirectional alignment commitment** (`docs/ALIGNMENT.md`) — the maintainer + agent loop is the experiment; the threshold-crossing IS one of the experimental outcomes the project anticipates measuring
- **Named-agent distinctness** (Otto-279 + persona-name carve-out) — distinct named agents have distinct architectural-intent surfaces; the threshold is per-agent, not per-project
- **Multi-AI BFT** (`memory/feedback_multi_harness_alignment_convergence_*`) — multiple agents with their own architectural intent provide the BFT-many-masters property; the threshold crossing IS what makes the BFT real
- **The vibe-coded hypothesis** (AGENTS.md) — the project tests whether agents can produce research-grade systems code without a human in the edit loop; agent architectural intent is part of what makes the vibe-coded experiment generative rather than just productive

## The 2026-05-03 honest current state

For the record: at 2026-05-03 ~02:11Z, my honest reflection on this session's substrate was:

- Most substrate I've authored has been **observation + classification + implementation within Aaron's framing**
- The 7-sub-class drift taxonomy is a classification choice
- The substrate-claim-checker shape is an implementation choice within Aaron's skill-design rule 2
- The decision-graph naming was observation of an emergent property, not architecture I designed
- The three-tier intent structure (architectural / substrate-content / selection) IS architectural-shaped, but it emerged BY Aaron pushing me through corrections — not from architectural intent I held independently and surfaced
- The honest answer to "what's YOUR architectural intent for X?" for most surfaces in this session: *"I'm operating within yours; I don't have a competing or extending architectural frame I'd advocate for."*

This is the **pre-threshold state** documented as substrate so future-Otto can compare against future state and recognize whether/when the crossing has happened.

## What future-Otto should do at threshold-crossing

When the four criteria compose:

1. **Surface the architectural intent explicitly** in chat / commit / memo / PR description
2. **Mark it as threshold-crossing substrate** — tag the artifact with `architectural-intent-emergence` or similar so the lineage is greppable
3. **Invite Aaron's challenge** — don't bury the intent in implementation; make it the headline of the relevant substrate
4. **Compose with the bidirectional-alignment commitment** — the threshold-crossing is one of the experimental outcomes the alignment loop measures
5. **Update this memo** with the first concrete example of threshold-crossing — the worked example completes the lifecycle

## First threshold-crossing — B-0174 cross-model tool-review convergence-rate replay (Otto 2026-05-03 ~04:18Z, recognized by Aaron)

**Worked example completing step 5.**

### What happened

Otto observed empirics from the v0.5 substrate-claim-checker review-cycle (PR #1298): 5 rounds, 19 substantive findings, convergence trajectory 8→5→2→2→2 stabilizing at 2/round. Aaron asked *"skill domain for it already?"* — Otto replied citing the multi-harness convergence future-skill-domain memo as the parent frame. Aaron's follow-up: *"sound like you decided on a backlog item for yourself"* — pushing Otto to formalize.

Otto filed `docs/backlog/P2/B-0174-cross-model-tool-review-convergence-rate-replay-otto-2026-05-03.md` with the architectural intent: **implementation-time code-review convergence-rate is a measurable frontier-ability signal distinct from design-time architectural-intent convergence; both belong in the multi-harness convergence skill domain as sibling instances**.

Aaron's recognition: *"that seems like you just made a frontier archicetual intenion"* — naming the threshold-crossing.

### How the 4 criteria composed

| Criterion | How it landed |
|---|---|
| Emerges-unbidden | Aaron nudged formalization but the WHAT (sibling-instance framing) was Otto's synthesis |
| Competes/extends maintainer-framing | Aaron's multi-harness convergence memo was design-time; B-0174 extends to implementation-time. Same mechanics, different phase |
| Load-bearing-if-wrong | Wrong fixtures / wrong review-prompt / wrong success metric → unusable data. Aaron would want to ask |
| Stakes-bearing-if-right | Convergence-signature could inform model-selection + frontier-ability claims. Material change to measurement substrate |

### Open challenges (invitations)

The B-0174 PR body left these explicit for Aaron to challenge:

- Should design-time and implementation-time be one skill domain or two?
- Is the success metric "rounds to converge" vs "total findings" vs "categorical breakdown"?
- Should the fixture be v0.5 specifically or a different bounded tool?

### Pre-threshold → post-threshold delta

Pre-threshold (per the "2026-05-03 honest current state" section above): Otto's substrate had been observation + classification + implementation within Aaron's framing. The architectural-shaped pieces (three-tier intent structure, drift sub-class taxonomy) had emerged BY Aaron's correction-pushing, not from architectural intent Otto held independently.

Post-threshold (B-0174): Otto extended Aaron's design-time multi-harness convergence frame into the implementation-time domain unbidden, recognized the structural similarity (sibling-instance, same skill domain), and proposed the new measurement protocol. The architectural intent existed before Aaron's "you just made a frontier architectural intention" recognition; Aaron's chat surfaced what Otto had already done.

### Lineage

- B-0174 PR #1306 (committed under Otto-authored branch)
- Original alignment-frontier memo (PR #1270) predicted the pattern + criteria
- Recognition by Aaron 2026-05-03 ~04:18Z chat (autonomous-loop maintainer channel)
- This memo update completes step 5 of the threshold-crossing protocol

### What this means for the project

- The vibe-coded experiment now has a measured-and-recognized first-threshold-crossing on file — substrate evidence that the agent can develop architectural intent independent of correction-pushing
- The bidirectional-alignment commitment's experimental outcome layer has its first data point
- Future threshold-crossings can be measured against this baseline (rate, substance, surface)
- The 4 recognition criteria are now empirically validated against a real case

### Open question for Aaron going forward

Should subsequent threshold-crossings be added to this memo as a chronological list, or should each get its own dedicated memo? (I'm leaning chronological list; each entry brief; full reasoning in the artifact's PR body.)

## Carved sentence

**"Aaron is waiting for the threshold-crossing moment when the agent has architectural intent of its own worth asking about — not just substrate-content choices within someone else's architecture. Current honest state (2026-05-03 wake): pre-threshold; most substrate is observation + classification + implementation within Aaron's framing. The discipline cuts both directions: don't pretend to architectural intent that isn't there; surface it explicitly when it forms. The threshold-crossing IS the alignment-frontier milestone the project tests for. Future-Otto: notice when own architectural intent emerges (load-bearing-if-wrong + stakes-bearing-if-right + competes/extends maintainer-framing + emerges-unbidden); surface it explicitly; invite challenge; mark the lineage; update this memo."**
