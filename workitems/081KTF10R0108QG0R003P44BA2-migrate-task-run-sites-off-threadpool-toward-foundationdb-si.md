# Migrate Task.Run sites off threadpool toward FoundationDB single-thread deterministic model

<!-- Work-item body. ZetaId-keyed (conflict-free, time-sortable). "Backlog" is a
     STATE = this folder; completion moves the file to workitems/done/YYYY/MM/.
     Identity is the zetaid prefix — resolve cross-refs by `081KTF10R0108QG0R003P44BA2-*.md` glob. -->

## Why (direction)

Concurrency must be **scale-free across thread count**: beautiful on 1 thread
(deterministic, DST-replayable, FoundationDB-style) AND scale to N — same code
path. The mechanism is a **ferry-boat throttle**: a bounded queue + a
`MaxDegreeOfParallelism` knob; DoP=1 ⇒ single cooperative loop ⇒ deterministic,
DoP=N ⇒ N ferries. Raw `Task.Run` is a **smell** because it is *un-knobbed*
spawn — no DoP ceiling, no queue, no 1-thread mode, nondeterministic (DST §7
can't replay). The migration target is NOT "single-thread only"; it is "route
parallel work through a DoP-knobbed throttle that defaults to 1." See the rule
`.claude/rules/async-all-the-way-truthful-signatures.md`. Prior-art anchor: the
maintainer's Itron `Threading.Tasks.Throttling` (`IThrottler`,
`ThrottlerConfiguration.MaxDegreeOfParallelism`, ActionBlock / SemaphoreSlim
impls); FDB anchor: Zhou et al. SIGMOD 2021; Will Wilson, Strange Loop 2014.

## Coordination

Vera is actively reworking async perf in her own clone (incl. the SpineAsync
worker). This note is a **finding for coordination, not a parallel edit** — do
not push code changes to these files while that work is in flight; fold into it.

## Sites found (sweep 2026-06-06)

1. **`src/Core/SpineAsync.fs:33`** — background merge worker is still a
   lifetime `Task.Run(Func<Task>(...))`. The sync-over-async blocker
   (`reader.WaitToReadAsync(...).AsTask().Result`) was removed by PR #6693;
   the worker now awaits `WaitToReadAsync`. Remaining design question for the
   FDB direction: should this worker exist as a separate task at all, or fold
   into `FerryThrottler` / the single run loop once the result arity lands?

2. **`src/Core/Runtime.fs:77`** — `ShardedRuntime.StepAsync` fans shard work out
   via `Array.init shardCount (fun i -> Task.Run(...))` + `Task.WhenAll`.
   Un-knobbed fan-out: always spawns `shardCount` threadpool tasks, no DoP=1
   mode, nondeterministic interleaving. Target: route shard steps through a
   ferry-boat throttle with `MaxDegreeOfParallelism` (DoP=1 on the sim/seed path
   ⇒ deterministic per-shard order; DoP=N in production). Same code path both.

## Not violations (reviewed, leave as-is)

- `src/Core/PluginHarness.fs` ×4 — synchronous law-runner harness; canonical
  ValueTask sync-consume idiom (`IsCompletedSuccessfully` then
  `GetAwaiter().GetResult()`); no async caller to mislead.

## Related landed work

- `IAsyncBackingStore` / `BackedSpineAsync` additive contract (the truthful-async
  disk store Vera deferred) — separate work item; gives a single-thread-friendly
  async I/O path so no `Task.Run`-over-sync-I/O pretense is needed for spill.
