# 12-factor as repo-split lens; repeated-correction corpus is the trainset floor

Aaron 2026-08-27: 12-factor app is a **good categorization** for splitting
repos. The manifesto / building codes are a **lower layer** — CS and
engineering vs ad hoc, for **any code of any kind**. 12-factor is about
SaaS/deploy shape (one codebase, config in env, backing services, …).
The dataset he is **most interested in** is the **corrections he keeps
giving over and over**: how to write the code, the rules that reduce
errors. Copy-pasting them into every prompt still fails. That corpus
is the trainset floor (`ρ` stack: trainset is the layer you cannot
get below with prompt/context alone).

## Two layers, do not fuse

| layer | what it is | Beacon |
|---|---|---|
| **12-factor** | categorization for *apps* / extracts (codebase, deps, config, backing services, build/release/run, …) | Adam Wiggins, Heroku, 2011, 12factor.net |
| **Manifesto / building codes** | how *any* substrate is constructed (scale-free, lock-free, weight-free, DST, DV2, …) vs ad hoc | `docs/governance/MANIFESTO.md` — "closer to building codes than to manifesto" |

Repo split uses **both**, plus the already-measured DV2 change-rate and
toolchain-closure lenses (`081M120GFSV087G0R003XCPC64`). 12-factor I
(one codebase per app, many deploys) is the *after-extract* shape, not
a reason to keep the monorepo forever.

## The correction corpus

The highest-value dataset is **repeated human corrections** of how
code should be written — the coding defaults learned over years.
Prompt injection of the same rules does not produce adherence. That
is the `ρ` trainset floor: context/memory/vendor still share the
corpus. Moving the floor means **this** set in the train / the
ontology / the generators, not another CLAUDE.md paste.

Do not invent a collection pipeline this slice. Name it. Next honest
slice: a store-native log of correction events (Z-set, retractable)
keyed by `(rule, violation, repair)` so a generator has both halves.
`"Failed"` has no second half (Landauer erasure). Activation over
those pairs shapes the ontology (same two-way attention as the
harness window).

## First named seed (Otto 2026-08-27; independently recounted)

27 `lint-*.ts` impl; 5 emit `FIX:`/`Fix:` prose (uppercase-only: 2);
machine-applicable at lint tier **0/27**. 86 `audit-*.ts`. 13 healer
modules — a separate population, no shared rule identity.
`Finding` has no `fix` field. Ambition is **push work down**; if you
route up, **take metrics** so the expensive use can mint a cheaper
rule. Composable one-shot rules (expert-system shape); BNN is the
wrong name for an addressable DAG. Lumen (factor/EP belief half) and
Soraya (detection is a join-semilattice; DAG is residue of
non-confluence) are both held. Store is canonical (Soraya);
the posterior is which *viewer* is attached (Lumen), not which
bytes. Flip-flopping view rules are Newman on the projection —
report `ViewsDisagree`, do not average them into the hub.

Do not add 22 `FIX:` strings, and do not write patches, as a
rider on this naming slice. Same-day: `labelled-observation.ts`
is the collector type (disagreement-shaped; no winner). This
census is a seed for that type, not a second schema.
