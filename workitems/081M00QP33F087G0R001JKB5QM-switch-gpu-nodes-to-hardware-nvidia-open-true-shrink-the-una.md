# Switch GPU nodes to hardware.nvidia.open = true — shrink the unauditable ring-0 surface to GSP firmware only

## Why

`full-ai-cluster/nixos/modules/gpu.nix:33` sets `open = lib.mkDefault false` — the closed
out-of-tree kernel module. NVIDIA's open kernel modules support Turing/Ampere/Ada/Hopper, report
performance parity, and became the default from the R560 driver release. The cards in hand
(RTX 4090 + RTX 3090, `docs/HARDWARE-CAPABILITY-MATRIX.md:26`) are both in scope.

Flipping this replaces an unreadable ring-0 blob with source. It does **not** remove the GSP
firmware blob or the CUDA userspace — both stay closed and NVIDIA-signed. The binding moves; it
does not disappear. That is the point: this is a cheap reduction of unauditable surface, not a
solution to the vendor binding.

## The work is the verification, not the change

The change is one line. What earns the flip:

1. Confirm the pinned `nvidiaPackages.production` version is >= R560.
2. Bench the BNN/inference workload before and after on one GPU worker. NVIDIA claims parity;
   Fedora has reported at least one Turing-specific regression (Runtime D3 with open kernel +
   GSP). Consumer Ampere/Ada is expected clean but has not been measured here.
3. Confirm CUDA, the container toolkit, and a GPU pod schedule unchanged.
4. Roll one node first, per the same sequencing the secure-boot work uses.

## Not claimed

This does not improve attestation. The module is not in the measured chain either way (the initrd
carries only `virtio_*`; the driver loads post-boot from the store). This is an auditability
change, not a trust-chain change.

## Anchor

## Status 2026-08-16 — gate built, flip NOT made, blocked on which-GPU-is-in-which-box

Item stays open. Step 1 is done and measured; the flag was deliberately not flipped.

### Step 1 — driver version: CONFIRMED, mechanically

`nvidiaPackages.production` at the pinned `nixpkgs` rev (`b77b3de8775677f84492abe84635f87b0e153f0f`,
`nixos-25.11`) is **580.142**, well past the R560 line. Read out of the pinned rev, not asserted:

```
nix eval --impure --raw --expr 'let f = builtins.getFlake "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/b77b3de…"; \
  p = import f { system = "x86_64-linux"; config.allowUnfree = true; }; in p.linuxPackages.nvidia_x11.version'
# => 580.142
```

### The measured closure delta

`nixos/modules/hardware/video/nvidia.nix` at that rev makes exactly one substitution:
`boot.extraModulePackages = if open then [ nvidia_x11.open ] else [ nvidia_x11.bin ]`.
Evaluated against **this repo's own** `gpu.nix`, both ways:

| `hardware.nvidia.open` | package in `boot.extraModulePackages` | `meta.unfree` | license | on cache.nixos.org |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `false` (today) | `nvidia-x11-580.142-6.12.90` (`bin` output) | **true** | `unfreeRedistributable` | **no — 404** |
| `true` | `nvidia-open-6.12.90-580.142` | **false** | `GPL-2.0-or-later` + `MIT` | yes, NarSize **23,949,280 B**, 0 refs |

So the number is: **the unfree package count in `boot.extraModulePackages` goes 1 → 0** — the whole
of that surface, not a fraction of it — and the replacement is source-built from
`NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules` at tag `580.142`, whose source nar is **126,145,240 B** of readable
code standing where an opaque prebuilt `.ko` was.

A second, unlooked-for gain: the closed `bin` output is **not in the public binary cache** (404),
while the open module **is** (200). The flip moves the ring-0 artifact from vendor-blob-at-install
to a hash-locked, publicly-reproducible build.

**What does NOT leave, so the claim stays bounded.** `nvidia-x11-580.142-6.12.90` (the `out`
userspace: libGL, libnvidia-*) stays unfree and stays in the closure. The GSP firmware output is
also still unfree and also not cached (404) — and GSP is loaded *today* regardless, since
`hardware.nvidia.gsp.enable` already defaults true for driver >= 555. `nvidia-settings`,
`nvidia-persistenced`, `nvidia-container-toolkit` and the whole `cuda*` set are untouched: the
`allowUnfreePredicate` in `gpu.nix` is unchanged by this work. The binding moves; it does not
disappear — exactly as the "Not claimed" section above says.

### Why the flip did not happen: no host in this repo has a known GPU

All four GPU host configurations — `full-ai-cluster/nixos/hosts/worker-gpu`,
`.../worker-template`, `infra/nixos/hosts/worker-gpu-01`, `worker-gpu-02` — carry a **PLACEHOLDER**
`hardware-configuration.nix`, and every `--node-label=zeta.io/gpu-model=…` line in them is commented
out. Nothing in the repo says which card is in which box.

The three inventory surfaces do not close the gap either:

- `inventory/items/` (the audited register) — **one** GPU: an RTX 4090.
- `docs/HARDWARE-CAPABILITY-MATRIX.md` — prose, no per-node binding.
- `docs/inventory/hardware-2026-05-27-addison-draft.md` — 19 NVIDIA cards
  (5090 ×1, 4090 ×1, 3090 ×4 incl. one "uncertain provenance", 3080 Ti ×6, 3060 Ti ×4, 3060 ×3)
  plus 5 AMD RX 6700 XT = the 24 GPUs the sibling item counts. **Every NVIDIA card on that list is
  Ampere or newer**, i.e. nothing pre-Turing appears anywhere in the fleet — which is genuinely good
  news for this item. But the draft is self-flagged unreliable, Addison is **redoing** it
  (`081M00R59KS087G0R001W3837V`), and it maps cards to *the house*, never to *a node*. "Probably no
  pre-Turing card exists" is not "this node's cards are Turing+".

This item is therefore **blocked on `081M00R59KS087G0R001W3837V`** — or, more cheaply, on one
operator running the preflight below on one node. It does not need the whole register reconciled;
it needs one node's silicon named. (Not duplicating that item's work here.)

### The correction the roster forces: `open = false` is not the safe default

The RTX 5090 on the roster is Blackwell, and NVIDIA ships **no proprietary kernel module** for
Blackwell — the open modules are required there. So on a node holding that card, today's
`open = lib.mkDefault false` is not the conservative setting, it is the **broken** one. The flag is
wrong in both directions depending on hardware nobody has recorded, which is the actual finding.

### What shipped instead of the flip

1. `tools/nvidia-open-preflight.sh` — run on a candidate node while the **closed** module is still
   loaded; gates on driver-reported CUDA compute capability **>= 7.5**. Capability rather than a
   PCI-ID table because NVIDIA device IDs are not ordered by architecture, so any local table rots
   silently; 7.5 rather than 7 because **Volta is 7.0/7.2 and has no GSP** — the one case a
   `major >= 7` shortcut passes and the open module then cannot bind.
2. `{full-ai-cluster,infra}/nixos/modules/nvidia-open-guard.nix` — two gates.
   **Eval time:** `open = true` without `zeta.gpu.openModulePreflight.passed` (and non-empty
   `.evidence`) fails the build, so the flip cannot land in review unattested.
   **Boot time:** a oneshot unit verifies every NVIDIA display-class PCI function actually has a
   driver bound (`vfio-pci` accepted as deliberate passthrough), catching a wrong-generation node
   even if the attestation was wrong or a card was swapped later.
3. Both `gpu.nix` files keep `open = lib.mkDefault false`, with the stale comment
   ("works on RTX 20-series and newer", silent on Blackwell) replaced by the measured position.

### Still unexercised — do not read this item as verified

Steps 2, 3 and 4 above are untouched. **No GPU ran any of this.** Not benchmarked, no CUDA check,
no container-toolkit check, no GPU pod scheduled, no node rolled. The boot-time guard has never
executed on real hardware. What *is* verified is the eval behaviour (all four gate states, both
module trees) and the preflight's decision logic against stubbed rosters, including a mutation run
proving the 7.5 threshold test can go red.
