# Migrate gate (required) to floor-only — after registry + scoped runner + consent

<!-- ZetaId-keyed work item. Minted 2026-07-09 by Otto (cowork) from the
     drift-and-heal ADR build-out (docs/DECISIONS/2026-07-09-drift-and-heal-
     replaces-pre-merge-gates-reconciliation-at-ai-speed.md). -->

The contraction step: branch protection's required check becomes the
uncompensatable-floor check only (seconds-fast, no toolchain
bootstrap); everything else converges via drift-and-heal. Blocked on:
floor registry (081KX3KA3EK…), scoped-diff runner (081KX3KA3ES…),
drift dashboard (081KX3KA3EW…), healer harness (081KX3KA3F0…), and the
ADR's consent path completing (it is Proposed, not ratified — this
item must NOT land before signatures).
