## Confirmed witness and scope

[Independent source review and native witnesses](../docs/research/chsh-coverage/2026-09-06-audit.md)
show that an absent subtractive CHSH bucket produces score 3 from constant
local responses. Both calibrated component paths and the direct metrology
consumer classify it above bound. A single observation in the rare bucket also
passes with total-count/HAC calibration.

## Acceptance

- Preserve the original native witness and fresh-build source evidence.
- Keep raw descriptive CHSH scores; require coverage and valid probe values
  before calibrated inference in both APIs and the direct meter.
- Prevent abundant buckets from hiding a rare bucket behind total sample size.
- Retain balanced controls and test refinement relative to the old margin.
- State that coverage refusal is not a full statistical calibration theorem.

The component-count terminology follow-up is separately owned. This repair
must not claim that surviving components prove physical source distinctness.
