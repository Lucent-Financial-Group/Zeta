# A dry run wrote to a tracked file and printed that it had no side effects

## The defect

`run-loop-real.ts` called `recordReasoning(args.repoRoot, reasoning)` **unconditionally**, twelve
lines above the branch that prints:

```
[dry-run] would execute — exiting without side-effects
```

`recordReasoning` appends to `data/tick-reasoning.jsonl`, which is **tracked**. So the banner was
simply false, and every `--dry-run` invocation dirtied the working tree.

## The consequential half

The dirty tree is the visible symptom. What matters is **what reads that file**.

`decorrelation-meter.ts` folds `tick-reasoning.jsonl` into **pairwise agreement between agents**,
keyed by the `agent` field — the measurement of how much the agents' decisions correlate beyond
chance.

`loop-resilience-probe.ts` drives ten scenarios under the agent name `"resilience"`: a raised e-stop,
a corrupt control-plane flags file, an unparseable promotion window, a window with a `NaN` counter, a
dead Ollama daemon, an invalid forge token. **Every probe run injected a phantom agent into that
measurement, whose every "decision" was made under deliberately broken conditions.**

Measured: one probe run appended **21 records** and grew the file by 20,720 bytes.

## The probe's own contract said this must not happen

Its header already said it plainly:

> A resilience probe that could push, merge, or write to the event log would be a chaos harness with
> side effects, and the one thing it must never do is **become the incident it is testing for**.

That was a claim in a comment, and it was false. It is now an **assertion**: the probe fingerprints
`data/tick-reasoning.jsonl` and `workitems/events` before the first scenario, compares after the
last, and **exits 1** if either changed.

## The fix

`if (!args.dryRun) recordReasoning(...)`. A dry tick is an observation, not a decision that reached
the world. It is still **printed**, so nothing is hidden from an operator; it is not **recorded**,
because the record is evidence.

The banner now says so: `exiting without side-effects (no reasoning record written)`.

## Falsifiers

The harness check is verified by restoring the defect, not asserted:

```
# with recordReasoning unconditional again
bun src/Core.TypeScript/observe/loop-resilience-probe.ts    # exit 1
  FAIL  the probe modified tracked state it promised not to touch:
        !! data/tick-reasoning.jsonl: file:156563 -> file:177283

# with the guard
bun src/Core.TypeScript/observe/loop-resilience-probe.ts    # exit 0
  PASS  tracked state untouched (2 path(s) checked)
10/10 scenarios behaved as specified
```

`git status data/tick-reasoning.jsonl` is clean after a full probe run and after a single
`--dry-run` tick.

## Two bugs in the check itself, caught before it landed

Worth recording because a hygiene check that is wrong is worse than none — it reports PASS.

1. **A filtered index read against the unfiltered array.** The first version was
   `before.filter(...).map((b, i) => ... after[i] ...)`, where `i` is the position in the _filtered_
   list. That is right whenever nothing changed and wrong in exactly the case the check exists for.
   Now a single `flatMap` over the original.
2. A mangled escape produced a literal newline inside a string, which failed to parse. Loud, and
   fixed immediately — recorded only because it sat one line from the silent bug above.

## Honest limit

The check watches two paths by name. It catches a regression in the write it was built for and any
new write to `workitems/events`; it would not catch a write to some third tracked path. A general
`git status` check would be stronger and would also flag unrelated dirt in a developer's tree, which
is why it is a named list — stated so the coverage is known rather than assumed.

## Noticed in passing, not fixed here

`bun test src/Core.TypeScript/observe/` has **7 pre-existing failures on unmodified `main`** — tilde
expansion, repo-relative default paths, a ZetaId shard filename, and a `link` symlink test. All look
Windows-specific and all fail identically without this change; verified by stashing it and re-running.
Unrelated to this defect and left alone.
