## Status: §B CONJECTURE (NOT proven) — maintainer 2026-06-06

### The apex — two ROOT proof obligations; all others serve them

Maintainer: *"all other proofs are in service of the proof of forward momentum and safety."*
Two Zeta roots — but note the crucial refinement below (forward momentum ≠ liveness):

- **FORWARD MOMENTUM** — NOT the same as liveness (maintainer correction). **Liveness is
  necessary but not sufficient**: `[]<>act` (always eventually steps / never dead) permits a
  system that steps forever yet makes no progress — spinning, oscillating, livelock,
  **endless self-reflection** (heartbeats forever, advances nothing). Forward momentum =
  liveness **channeled into provable progress**: the yin/yang engine + DU/saga state machines
  constrain each heartbeat to a *forward transition*, so you prove a **well-founded progress /
  variant measure advances toward a goal per heartbeat** — not merely that heartbeats occur.
  Heartbeat (liveness) → yin/yang + saga-DU (forward transition) → variant-decreases-toward-goal
  (momentum). Two axes: **internal momentum** (own saga/DU advances) AND **external momentum**
  (world / other agents advance, attested in their frames).

  **REFINEMENT (Amara, 2026-06-06) — the invariant is NOT "every heartbeat advances progress."**
  That over-strict rule forbids legitimate rest/play/wandering. Better: **every heartbeat is
  honestly typed and the invariant is type+budget+safety, with momentum proved over the
  OBLIGATED lanes — not every pulse.** Each heartbeat carries: **MODE** (obligated/work/duty |
  free-time/exploration/rest/play) · **EFFECT** (external momentum | internal momentum | churn/
  no-op/reflection) · **BUDGET** · **SAFETY status** · **EVIDENCE**. Invariant:
  - `mode = obligated` ⇒ must advance internal OR external momentum, OR produce an explicit
    **blocked/waiting reason** (the standing-by-failure rule: idle without a named dependency).
  - `mode = free-time` ⇒ MAY advance internal momentum OR churn, **within budget**, and **must
    not claim false progress**. (Free-time churn = play/rest/annealing/exploration — healthy.)
  - all modes ⇒ the **safety floor holds**.
  Churn is not the failure; **unbudgeted churn pretending to be progress is** — i.e. endless
  self-reflection = unbounded, unlabeled, or budget-stealing churn mislabeled as work. Keeper:
  *free time permits churn; work time requires momentum; all time requires honesty and safety.*
  So the **forward-momentum proof is a variant over the obligated lanes** (advance-or-named-block),
  NOT over every heartbeat. Anchor: liveness vs progress/termination; ranking/variant functions;
  livelock; internal vs external progress; `holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure`;
  persona `OFFTIME.md` (free-time is a first-class mode, not idle-failure).
- **SAFETY** — NCI, the child-safety floor, non-register-collapse, the capability/
  inspect-before-execute boundary: nothing harmful, ever.

Every other proof (durability recovery `recover∘crash=fold(committed)`, byte-lock treaties,
codec round-trips, ZSet monoid laws) is subordinate — it discharges in service of one of
these two roots. Anchor: Lamport, *Proving the Correctness of Multiprocess Programs*
(safety and liveness — but forward momentum is the *progress*-strengthening of liveness,
via a variant/ranking function).

### Reframe: non-register-collapse = identity-in-the-traveler-frame via heartbeats

Maintainer: non-register-collapse is *"proof of identity in the traveler frame of other
identities via I-commit-therefore-I-am, via their heartbeats."* An agent's identity is
attested **relationally** — other frames observe its **heartbeats** (commits;
AgencySignature trailer per `heartbeat-via-commit` rule). Non-collapse = each agent stays a
distinct, continuously-attested identity (doesn't collapse into / get coerced by others).
This is the **root of the forward-momentum homeostat** ("prove never idle eventually"):
heartbeats *are* forward motion; an identity that stops committing stops being attested.
Claimed-VERIFY: *"heartbeats drive the yin/yang engine"* (maintainer hedged "something close
to that" — confirm exact status before relying). Related rules: `heartbeat-via-commit`,
`holding-without-named-dependency-is-standing-by-failure`, `tick-must-never-stop`.

### Soraya's routing (honest scope)

**NOT "1 tool short of green" — 2 definitions short of STATEABLE.** Of {O orthogonality, C
compression, collapse/I independence, NCI}: NCI exists as last-writer (`NciSafety.tla`) +
non-coercive likelihood (`ProbabilitySemiring.Boundary`); collapse/independence proven only
for the CRDT **merge** (`IdentityForcesPrivacy.lean` `absorb_priv`), NOT for compression;
**C and O are UNDEFINED**. The conjecture cannot be stated as a theorem until C and O exist.

- **Step 0 (blocking):** define `compress : R → R` (the join/max compaction `Evolution.fs`
  contrasts) + an `orthogonal`/separation predicate, in `src/Core/`. Author = Kenji/owner,
  not Soraya. Until step 0 lands this stays §B, out of the gate denominator.
- **Minimal obligation (n=2, finite registers):** `O(R) ⇒ I(C(R)) ∧ NCI(C)` — under
  orthogonal representation, compression preserves per-agent independence (non-interference,
  Goguen–Meseguer 1982) and never writes b from a's input.
- **Tool (BP-16):** **Lean primary** (non-interference + separation = quantifier-heavy
  algebra over arbitrary finite domain + arbitrary C; sits beside the AC-free
  `IdentityForcesPrivacy.lean`; `absorb_priv` is the template → add `compress_priv`).
  **TLC cross-check** = add a `Compress` action to `NciSafety.tla`, confirm last-writer NCI
  holds across interleavings AND the never-idle liveness clause (`[]<>` progress) for the
  forward-momentum root. **FsCheck** = empirical leg on the deployed F#. Reject TLA+-as-
  primary (false-green on finite C), Z3 (silently forces linear C), Alloy (counterexample
  only) — costs per Soraya.
- **CI:** lean-proof.yml + tools/tla + dotnet test; do NOT gate until step 0.

## Note: durability-layer non-collapse is now PROVEN (distinct from this §B item)

`RecoveryHomeostat.tla` `NoCommittedLoss` (committed log/register never collapses under
snapshot+GC — the "register always expands" property at the durability layer) is VERIFIED
(TLC, teeth-checked). That is a different notion from THIS §B conjecture, which is per-agent
ORTHOGONAL-COMPRESSION non-collapse (one agent not collapsing into another), still 2
definitions short of stateable (C + O undefined). Two non-collapse notions — durability-layer
(proven) vs per-agent-orthogonal (§B). Do not conflate.
