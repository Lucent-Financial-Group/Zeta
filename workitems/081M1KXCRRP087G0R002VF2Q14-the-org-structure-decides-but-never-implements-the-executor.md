# The org structure decides but never implements: the executor port had no real adapter

## What already worked

The corporate structure in `agentic-organization` is real and, verified by running it rather than
reading it, it works:

- **117 hats** across the full ladder — 1 Executive Board, 5 C-suite, 15 Director, 11 Manager,
  3 Lead, 82 Individual Contributor — over 16 departments, with a single `reportsTo` edge per hat and
  the supervisor graph validated acyclic.
- **`runOrgCycle`** drives one work item through executive/director prioritization → RMO hat-supply
  voting → reputation-ranked hat assignment → binding lifecycle → the 7-gate pipeline. One run
  emitted **88 events across all six levels** and reached `merged`, with 17 bindings, 7 gates passed,
  and an expiry + succession observed.
- **The RMO** is complete: `computeRequiredHatSupply` derives demand deterministically from
  prioritized work, supervisors (CFO, Directors, Cost Controller, Hat Approval Steward) **vote** on
  the target count, `rankRmoHatCandidates` scores candidates on reputation, schedule reliability,
  review quality, QA pass rate, load, freshness and an exploration bonus, and
  `decideRmoHatAssignment` picks within the legal set. Every supply decision carries its
  `supervisorChain` (e.g. `executive_board_member → ceo → cfo`).
- **`runWorkOsCycle`** models the living loop: defect intake → triage → develop → QA catches a
  regression → bounce-backs → churn detected → escalation adds agents via the RMO and brings in an
  architect → green → released.

## What did not

**None of it did any work.**

`TestExecutor` in `qa.ts` describes itself as _"the execution port — the real runner is computer-use
/ browser / API; tests use a fake."_ Grepping the whole tree, `createDeterministicExecutor` was its
**only** implementation — and it takes the outcome as an argument:

```ts
const outcome = plan.get(testCase.testCaseId) ?? TestRunOutcome.Passed;
```

And `runWorkOsCycle` **hardcoded** it, with no field in `WorkOsCycleDeps` to supply another. The
develop stage was a state transition whose decision string read `"fix implemented; into review/QA"`
— nothing was implemented.

So the organization could staff a work item through the entire hierarchy, cross every quality gate,
catch "regressions", escalate on churn, pull in more agents, bring in an architect, and release —
**without a line of work being done or a single assertion being checked.** `finalStage: "merged"` was
a label.

The pieces to fix it already existed and were simply not joined: `SandboxToolPort` (bounded,
env-stripped, SIGKILL-on-timeout, with a real subprocess adapter at the composition root) was used
only by the hermes incident path, and `ChangeControlPort` (project/pull/push/merge onto a real PR or
Jira card) is referenced by neither org loop.

## The change

1. **`WorkOsCycleDeps` gains two optional ports** — `qaExecutor?: TestExecutor` and
   `implementer?: WorkImplementer`. Both default to today's behaviour, so all 1595 existing tests
   are unaffected; a caller who wants the org to do real work supplies them.
2. **`createSandboxTestExecutor`** — the real `TestExecutor` the port was designed for. It runs each
   case as a real subprocess through `SandboxToolPort` and reads the verdict from what the process
   printed. It cannot be told what to conclude.
3. **The develop stage calls the implementer**, and the post-bounce-back rework calls it again with
   an incremented attempt — so a re-attempt can genuinely differ from the first, which is what makes
   the churn → escalation path mean something.

### Two refusals, deliberately

- **Unknown ⇒ Failed.** A sandbox refusal or timeout is a failure, not a pass. An executor whose
  unknown case were "passed" would turn every sandbox outage into a green release.
- **Evidence is content-addressed** over the process's own stdout, so it names _what happened_ rather
  than _that something happened_. Two runs with different output cannot share a ref.

## The proof

`agentic-organization/apps/workers/test/org-implements-real-work.test.ts`, at the composition root where this codebase
says real adapters belong:

- the dev hat runs a real sandboxed subprocess that **writes a real file**
- QA runs a **different** real subprocess that reads it and judges it
- attempt 1 writes the **wrong** content, so QA genuinely fails
- churn is detected, the RMO adds agents, an architect is brought in
- the rework is genuinely correct, so QA genuinely passes, and the item reaches `Done`
- **the assertion is on the artifact on disk**, not on the report — the report is the org's account
  of itself, and an account is what the fixtures were already good at

Every file touch goes through the sandbox, because `agentic-organization/packages/test-node.d.ts` deliberately exposes
only `mkdtempSync`/`rmSync` from `node:fs`. Rather than widen that, the assertion travels the same
channel the organization does.

## Mutation matrix — and the one that survived

| mutant                                                | result                |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| the dev hat gets it right first time (no real defect) | **killed**            |
| the dev hat does no work at all                       | **killed**            |
| a non-PASS stdout treated as passing                  | **killed**            |
| an unusable sandbox result treated as PASS            | **survived at first** |

The survivor was a hole in my own falsifier. The "absent file" test reads a missing file — which
still **runs**: the process starts, prints `FAIL:<missing>`, exits 0. So it travels the `result.ok`
path, and flipping the `!result.ok` default to `Passed` killed nothing. The executor could have
shipped treating every sandbox outage as a green test.

_"The check failed"_ and _"the check never ran"_ are different facts, and only a test that reaches
the second pins it. Added — and it produces the refusal from the **real** adapter (which rejects a
non-absolute command path, because a relative one would resolve through PATH) rather than a stub.
All four mutants are now killed.

## Result

```
npm test    # 1599 tests, 1592 pass, 0 fail, 7 skipped   (baseline 1595 / 1588 / 0)
tsc         # 6 errors, all pre-existing in apps/workers integration tests, none in changed files
```

## Still open

- The **`ChangeControlPort` is still unwired**: the org can now implement and verify work, but does
  not project it onto a real PR or Jira card, so the release stage remains internal.
- The C-suite → director → manager → dev chain is exercised as an _attributed trace_; no agent
  model drives the hat decisions in this test (the choosers are deterministic).
- One environment note, seen three times today on this box: a loaded machine OOMs Node and the JVM.
  The first full run of this suite aborted with `JavaScript heap out of memory`; re-run on a clear
  box it is green. Not a defect in the change.
