# platform controllers die under node contention: 1s liveness timeouts and BestEffort QoS on sealed-secrets, headlamp, gatekeeper, NFD, cert-manager, spire, argocd, headscale

## Evidence (measured, not inferred)

Scheduled first-boot replica on `main`, 2026-09-30, run 36685251210, constrained lane
(4 vCPU / 12 GiB, 38 Applications): **17 Healthy, 2 DIVERGENCE, 19 FAIL**. Platform
controllers in CrashLoopBackOff or restarting: sealed-secrets, headlamp, trust-manager,
spire-server, cert-manager-webhook (CRASHLOOP) plus cert-manager controller/cainjector,
argocd repo-server (restartCount 3) / server (1), headscale-0, NFD gc/master/worker. The
unconstrained lane on 2026-09-29 (run 36538162478) had all of these Healthy: the same tree
dies when the node is contended, and the mechanism is the one already measured on
dispatch 36119931377 -- liveness probes kill containers that are slow, not dead.

Rendered chart defaults: `timeoutSeconds: 1`, `failureThreshold: 3` -> a RUNNING container is
killed after (3-1)*10+1 = 21s of slow answers (`probeStallToleranceSeconds`).

## What lands

Probes widened through each chart's own values coordinates (timeout 5s x 12 failures at a
10s period: kill budget 120s, stall tolerance 115s): sealed-secrets, headlamp, NFD
(gc/worker/master), cert-manager controller + webhook (+ the k3s bootstrap twin), argocd
server + repo-server (both pin sites), spire-server (+ bootstrap twin), headscale
(in-repo manifest), gatekeeper (timeout only -- the chart hardcodes period/threshold).

Falsifier: `liveness-kill-budget.ts` now GATES a `STALL_TOLERANCE_FLOORS` list -- red against
the pre-fix tree with exactly 13 violations (every container above), green after.

## Not fixed here, and why

- `cilium-operator`, `spire-controller-manager`, spiffe CSI registrar, hubble-ui: probe is
  hardcoded in the chart template, no values coordinate (upstream change only).
- `trust-manager`, external-secrets: no liveness probe at all; their CrashLoop is process exit
  (leader election / API timeouts under load), not a probe kill. UNVERIFIED cause.
- Resource requests (BestEffort QoS) on cert-manager, trust-manager, sealed-secrets,
  external-secrets, dapr, spire, longhorn-manager, argo-rollouts, argo-workflows, headlamp --
  `missing-resource-requests.ts` lists them ACTIONABLE. Each needs a `resourceClaims` row in
  `storage-profiles.json`, a regenerated snapshot and a budget re-fit, so it is its own change.
