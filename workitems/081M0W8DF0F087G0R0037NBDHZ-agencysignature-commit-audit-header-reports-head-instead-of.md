# AgencySignature commit audit header reports HEAD instead of the audited commit

<!-- Work-item body. ZetaId-keyed (conflict-free, time-sortable). "Backlog" is a

## Measured

After PR #15335 merged, this command correctly classified squash
`b0bded9329d31f6aabb38532842ff8866acd1e76` but printed the local branch tip in its header:

```text
bun src/Core.TypeScript/hygiene/audit-agencysignature-main-tip.ts \
  --commit b0bded9329d31f6aabb38532842ff8866acd1e76

target_rev: HEAD (3d820e0e4ab6714ca98387260b742f375916b911)
mode:       commit
[CORRECT]   b0bded9329d3
```

`buildCommitList` honors `--commit`, but `emitHeader` always receives the separately selected
branch target (`HEAD` unless `--branch` is present). The result is operationally correct and
diagnostically self-contradictory: it names one object while checking another.

## Acceptance

- In commit mode, `target_rev` names the exact requested revision and its resolved object ID.
- Head, max, since, and explicit-branch modes retain their current target semantics.
- A regression test audits a non-HEAD commit and rejects a header that still names `HEAD`.
