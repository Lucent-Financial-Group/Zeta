# ForgeHost GitHub adapter: native stored token plus REST/GraphQL, stop spawnSync gh

`GitHubAdapter` and `gh-cli.ts` still `spawnSync("gh", ...)`. Login is already
ours (`github-auth.ts` → `~/.config/zeta/auth/github.json`). The factory
work (PR create/merge, checks, GraphQL threads, rest-push) still shells `gh`.

Seed (this PR): `resolve-stored-token.ts` — store first, then `GH_TOKEN` /
`GITHUB_TOKEN`, never `gh auth token`. Adapters are not switched yet.

## Must

- Resolve token from OUR store first, then env (`GH_TOKEN` /
  `GITHUB_TOKEN`). Never `gh auth token` as the primary path.
- PR / issue / check / git-data mutations via injected `HttpTransport`
  (REST + GraphQL). `runGh` becomes a compatibility shim or dies.
- Three token *roles* stay (push vs PR-create vs telemetry) — that split
  is real (#15351). Roles are different stored identities, not `gh`.
- `GIT_ASKPASS` remains `github-login-cli.ts` for any leftover git HTTPS.

## Falsifier

A cell with only `~/.config/zeta/auth/github.json` (no `gh` on PATH)
can list PRs and create a PR. `spawnSync("gh"` in `src/Core.TypeScript`
goes to zero on the forge-host path, or each leftover is named and
allowlisted with a kill date.
