# chip8/9 boot crypto + workload identity

<!-- Work-item body. ZetaId-keyed (conflict-free, time-sortable). "Backlog" is a
     STATE = this folder; completion moves the file to workitems/done/YYYY/MM/.
     Identity is the zetaid prefix — resolve cross-refs by `081KTWFYC9108QG0R001C8RDPK-*.md` glob. -->

Migrated from the accidental legacy `B-1038` row so the item lives on the current
ZetaId workitem surface instead of extending the frozen sequential backlog.

Review required before build: Nazar (ops) + Mateo (research); security-sensitive.

## Auth for the little machine, without teaching it crypto

> Aaron: "should we give it any crypto primitives inside, for initial boot and such — keys
> injected for auth, like workload identity?"

The design observation (to be red-teamed before any code):

1. **NOT inside the ISA.** chip8/9 stays tiny and deterministic; rolling crypto into a toy ISA is
   the roll-your-own-crypto smell wearing a cartridge. The machine never holds key material.
2. **Keys are INJECTED CAPABILITIES at the door** — an `io` line by ZetaId resolved up the ladder
   (Live/Injected/Mock), with the RED LIGHT showing when a signing capability is bound. NEVER a
   cartridge line: cartridges are public diffable text — a key in one is a secret on a visible
   surface, wrong by construction (the red-light law). The Mock rung = a rehearsal signer that
   cannot produce valid signatures (honest by construction, like the flat inference engine).
3. **Workload identity = the room's, not the machine's:** SPIFFE/SVID is the prior art — identity
   issued to the WORKLOAD at startup by the host (zflash maintainer-key chain + the warm-cache
   startup from 081KTSZN10008QG0R002J0GE0Z is exactly the issuance moment), scoped to the room's lifetime (the
   5-minute bound rotates credentials for free).
4. **Reticulum already speaks identity natively** (cryptographic identities are built into RNS) —
   the bus IS the auth surface; a crossing is signed at the membrane, metered and lit. Boot
   attestation stays at the HOST layer (zflash/SLSA lineage already in-tree).
5. Existing pieces to compose, not duplicate: Crypto.fs, Blake3/Sha256 treaty primitives,
   KeyStore.fs, AntiSybil, the headscale/github trust-bootstrap research, docs/security/.

Gate: Nazar + Mateo review the surface BEFORE implementation; no key handling lands without it.
