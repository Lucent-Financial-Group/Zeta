# FourCornerTrace VALUE needs IStarRing; C4 compass is not Cl(p,q)

Aaron 2026-08-26: FourCornerTrace VALUE (WSet ping-return; −1 = i² is a
ring identity) needs IStarRing. Clifford ±1 / C₄ compass on FourCorner
are related; they are **not** “it is Cl(p,q)”.

## This increment

- `src/Core/FourCornerC4.fs` — C₄ phase group; ℂ `i² = Negate(One)`;
  even-subalgebra embedding `e₁₂`; vector-square discriminator
  `e₁² = +1`; Cl(0,1) ≅ ℂ vs Cl(3,0) ≅ M₂(ℂ)
- Laws tests: group, ring witness, even embedding, discriminator,
  FourCornerTrace over `Cl3.Mv` weights; TRACE vs C₄ on existing
  `IStarRing` instances; law packs consume `IntegerRing.Star`;
  `e^{iπ} = i² = Negate(One)` (Euler = same C₄ point, analysis not ring);
  spin-½ `R(2π)=−1`; Pauli Z = multiply-by-e^{iπ}; two NSEW compasses compose
  at Meijer's missing feedback (2-corner duals traded for `OnError`;
  feedback product is reversible, error sum is erasing); FourCorner is
  **not** a fermion — Adinkra connection is Q-odd dashing = C₄ south;
  coded `[8,4]` 8B+8F vs uncoded `Cl(0,8)` halves; E8 roots+algebra
  metered, compact group still a substitute
- ROADMAP item 1 / P1 / shipped / continuous / research #8
- Research absorb: `docs/research/2026-08-26-fourcorner-c4-istarring-not-clpq.md`

## Remaining

- Product path may weight a live trace by `Cl3.Mv` without promoting
  FourCorner to Cl(p,q)
- Do not identify the I/O record with a Clifford algebra **or a fermion**
- Conformal CGA Cl(4,1) stays the Sequoia distance slice
- Compact Lie group E8 as a *manifold* (exp of the compact real
  form) — split Chevalley root groups `x_α(t)` now have multiply
  (`E8ChevalleyGroup`); that is the algebraic group, not the
  compact manifold
- Bound is **2√2** (front 2 = classical), not occupancy √2; `{Q,Q}`
  two deniable moves, snap is the collapse
- **Measure, don't model:** S=4 is the seed-shared measure; 2√2 is a
  predicted floor (unmeasured); occupancy `2×√2` lining up with
  Tsirelson is numerology; QubitIso is the qubit, FourCorner is
  the pipe
- Jitter is dual-use (degrades S *and* frost uniqueness); a
  latency-only sweep is underpowered; decorrelation is plural (Alexa)
- String keys: `Collation.binary` (BIN2_UTF8 / ordinal codepoint),
  never ambient culture
