/**
 * gitlab-mr-feedback.cjs — what happened to the organization's merge requests, read from GitLab.
 *
 * ── A READ, AND ONLY A READ ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The poller half of the after-the-handoff seam (`followup-commands.ts`): given the handed-off
 * changes on stdin, it asks GitLab what happened to each and prints one DELIVERY per event as a JSON
 * line. It writes nothing to GitLab - no comment, no label, no approval - and it decides nothing: a
 * delivery becomes an action item on the work, and the organization decides what to do about it.
 *
 * The same shape a webhook delivery is filed in, so a project that can reach this machine with
 * webhooks and one that cannot are the same organization. Every delivery id is STABLE per event
 * (a note's id, a target's commit), which is what makes a second poll raise nothing new.
 *
 *   comment          a person's note on the request (GitLab's own system notes, and a review bot's
 *                    announcement that it has STARTED reviewing, are skipped - see ANNOUNCED_REVIEW)
 *   merged / closed  the request left the open state - somebody integrated or abandoned it
 *   pipeline_failed  the request's head pipeline failed
 *   target_moved     the branch it targets is at a commit; the organization measures whether the
 *                    change is behind it before raising anything
 *
 * ── CONTRACT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   stdin               {"changes":[{"workId","branch","url","base"?}]}
 *   ORG_GLAB_BIN        the glab binary (default: the installed one); ORG_GLAB_BIN_ARGS a JSON array
 *                       of arguments placed before `api` (for a stand-in in tests)
 *   ORG_FEEDBACK_SOURCE the source name deliveries carry (default: gitlab)
 * Run inside the repository: `glab api` resolves the project and host from its remote, and
 * authenticates with glab's own stored login. No token passes through here or argv.

/**
 * A REVIEW BOT SAYING IT HAS STARTED IS NOT WORK.
 *
 * MEASURED on agentic-tpm !163 and !164, 2026-09-12: the AI review agent posts "Seen, AI Code Review
 * Agent is actively reviewing this merge request." on EVERY push, as an ordinary note rather than a
 * system one - so each one became an action item, and an action item is answered by a SESSION.
 * Three separate follow-up rounds across the two requests spent a whole session each, tens of
 * minutes and dollars apiece, to decide that a bot had announced itself - and the announcement came
 * back with the next push, so the rounds could not converge. The review it announces arrives as its
 * own note and is read on its own merits; the announcement carries no request at all.
 *
 * Narrow on purpose: the same author's actual review is thousands of characters and is NOT skipped.
