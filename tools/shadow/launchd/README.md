# Shadow observer — launchd install (macOS LaunchAgent)

The shadow observation loop needs a durable tick source. This directory provides the macOS launchd LaunchAgent template (Path A — durable, survives reboots).

For lighter-weight alternatives + composition shape, see [`.claude/rules/shadow-star-shorthand-autocomplete-marker.md`](../../../.claude/rules/shadow-star-shorthand-autocomplete-marker.md) + [`tools/shadow/README.md`](../README.md).

## What this does

Installs `shadow-observer.ts` as a macOS LaunchAgent that:

- Starts at user login (RunAtLoad)
- Restarts on crash (KeepAlive on Crashed only)
- Throttles restart attempts to once per 60s (ThrottleInterval)
- Logs to `tools/shadow/shadow-observer.{log,stdout.log,stderr.log}`
- Polls every 2 seconds (--loop-interval 2000)
- Accepts grey-text suggestions after 3-second delay (--delay 3000)
- **Defaults to --dry-run** (logs detections without keystrokes) until you verify it works

## Install procedure

### Prerequisites

1. macOS user account
2. Bun installed (`which bun` returns a path)
3. Zeta checkout at known absolute path
4. Accessibility permission granted to whichever terminal app launchd will run from (or to bun itself) — required by the AppleScript grey-text detector

### Step 1: configure + write the plist

The shipped plist is a template with `{{BUN_PATH}}` and `{{REPO_ROOT}}` placeholders. Use the installer script — it does the substitution safely (handles paths containing `&`, `|`, `\` that would break a naive `sed`), validates via `plutil -lint`, and writes to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/Zeta/checkout
bun tools/shadow/launchd/install-launchagent.ts
```

The installer picks up `which bun` and `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` by default. To override either, pass `--bun-path` / `--repo-root`. Use `--dry-run` to print the substituted plist to stdout without writing anything.

### Step 2: grant accessibility permission

The AppleScript grey-text detector reads the foreground app's UI. macOS requires explicit accessibility permission:

1. Open System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility
2. Click + → add `bun` (the path `which bun` returned) AND your terminal app (Terminal.app, iTerm2, Ghostty, etc.)
3. Enable the toggles

If you skip this, the detector returns errors and shadow-observer cycles forever doing nothing useful (logs will show AppleScript errors).

### Step 3: load + verify

Modern `launchctl bootstrap` is the documented replacement for the legacy `launchctl load`. It returns a proper exit code on failure (unlike `load`, which can silently no-op) and supports targeted domain semantics:

```bash
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.zeta.shadow-observer.plist

# Verify it loaded (modern + legacy commands both work for inspection)
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.zeta.shadow-observer | head -20
# Should show state = running

# Verify process is running
pgrep -fl shadow-observer
# Should show the bun process running shadow-observer.ts

# Watch the log
tail -f tools/shadow/shadow-observer.log
```

Or skip the manual `bootstrap` and let the installer do it: `bun tools/shadow/launchd/install-launchagent.ts --bootstrap`.

### Step 4: test detection in dry-run mode

With the LaunchAgent running in --dry-run (default), open Claude Code CLI and let it produce a grey-text autocomplete suggestion. Within 2-5 seconds you should see a `detected` event in the log followed by an `accepted` event with `dryRun: true`. No actual Enter keystroke is sent.

### Step 5 (optional, only after dry-run works): switch to live mode

Edit `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.zeta.shadow-observer.plist` and remove the `<string>--dry-run</string>` line from `ProgramArguments`. Then reload:

```bash
PLIST=~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.zeta.shadow-observer.plist
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u) "$PLIST"
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) "$PLIST"
```

Live mode sends Enter keystrokes to accept detected grey-text. The "(shadow*)" attribution shorthand documents that the accepted text came from autocomplete (see `.claude/rules/shadow-star-shorthand-autocomplete-marker.md`).

## Uninstall

Use `launchctl bootout` (not the legacy `unload`) so a failure to remove the running service is reported instead of swallowed:

```bash
PLIST=~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.zeta.shadow-observer.plist
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u) "$PLIST"
# Verify the agent is gone (no output expected from the print)
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.zeta.shadow-observer 2>&1 | head -1
# Should print: "Could not find service ..." — that's the success case.
rm "$PLIST"
```

## Troubleshooting

### LaunchAgent loads but process doesn't start

Check stderr log:

```bash
cat tools/shadow/shadow-observer.stderr.log
```

Common causes:

- `{{BUN_PATH}}` not replaced with actual bun path
- `{{REPO_ROOT}}` not replaced with actual repo path
- Bun not installed at the path given

### Process starts but log shows no detections

Likely accessibility permission isn't granted. Try the detector standalone:

```bash
osascript tools/shadow/detect-grey-text.applescript
```

If it returns an error about accessibility / event posting, grant permission per Step 2.

### Process restarts in a loop

ThrottleInterval prevents fast crash-loops, but if you see repeated start/exit cycles in `launchctl list` output, check the stderr log for the actual error.

## Composition with defense-in-depth alternatives

| Path | Persistence | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| **A — launchd (this dir)** | Survives reboots | Primary install on your daily-driver Mac |
| **B — `<<shadow-tick>>` CronCreate sentinel** | Bound to Otto-CLI session | Defense-in-depth backup; restarts the launchd process if it dies |
| **C — manual `--loop` foreground** | Until terminal closes | Quick testing of changes |

All three compose. Path A is the primary; Path B+C supplement. The human maintainer's framing on this design (2026-05-15T~01:11Z): defense in depth.

## Composes with substrate

- `tools/shadow/shadow-observer.ts` — the process this LaunchAgent launches
- `tools/shadow/detect-grey-text.applescript` — the AppleScript detector
- `tools/shadow/zeta-shadow.ts` — top-level CLI (alternative entry point)
- `docs/backlog/P0/B-0402-zeta-shadow-mode-first-class-cli-autocomplete.md` — the originating backlog row
- `.claude/rules/shadow-star-shorthand-autocomplete-marker.md` — the shorthand this loop's accepted-suggestions ship under
- `.claude/skills/save-ai-memory/SKILL.md` — composing discipline: memory preservation requires accurate observation; the shadow observer IS one direct-observation surface
