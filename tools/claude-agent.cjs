/**
 * claude-agent.cjs — Claude Code as an agent of the organization: it reads the repository, runs it,
 * edits it, commits, judges.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT ────────────────────────────
 * A CLIENT for the local Claude Code CLI. It knows how to be invoked by the organization's three
 * command seams, how to tell the agent who it is and where its worldview is, and how to answer in
 * each seam's protocol. It knows NOTHING about software delivery — no gate list, no idea what a BRD
 * holds, no opinion about reproduction. Those reach the agent from the organization: its practice
 * (ORG_PRACTICE / ORG_DIRECTIVES) and, above all, `observe`.
 *
 * ── THE WORLDVIEW IS ASKED FOR, NOT HANDED OVER ──────────────────────────────
 * The prompt says who the agent is, which work item it is acting on, and the command that shows it
 * everything else (`ORG_OBSERVE_CMD`, set by `run-org` for every child). What earlier steps
 * produced, what reviewers said, what the ticket says, where the change is checked out — the agent
 * opens the item and reads them. Nothing about the work is pre-copied into the prompt, so what an
 * agent knows no longer depends on which adapter happened to invoke it.
 *
 * ── THREE MODES, CHOSEN BY THE FIRST ARGUMENT, NEVER GUESSED ─────────────────
 *   work   <workId>                   --work-agent: make the change in this checkout; commit.
 *                                     stdout is testimony; a separate verifier decides.
 *   gate   <gate> <workId> [refs...]  --artifact-cmd: produce what <gate> judges, or ask a person.
 *                                     stdout is the artifact port's line protocol.
 *   review <gate> <workId>            --review-cmd: judge <gate> independently. Exit 0 approves,
 *                                     1 rejects; stdout is the reason.
 *
 * ── AUTHENTICATION ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The LOCAL CLAUDE CODE LOGIN, by default: the credential stays in Claude Code's own store and never
 * passes through this process, the organization's configuration, or argv. `ORG_CLAUDE_TOKEN_FILE`
 * is the fallback — a PATH, read at call time, placed only in the child's environment.
 *
 * ── PERMISSIONS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `dontAsk` with an explicit allowance per mode: anything not listed is denied, not prompted.
 * A mode that may change the checkout may not push, merge, rebase, switch branches or reset —
 * integrating is the organization's act (change control), never the agent's.
