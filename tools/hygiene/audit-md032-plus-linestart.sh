#
# Detects markdown files where a line starts with `+ ` inside
# a paragraph (no blank line above, previous line is not itself
# a `+ `-list continuation) — the pattern that markdownlint
# MD032 treats as "list item missing blank line" and that caused
# Otto-35 + Otto-38 regressions in the autonomous-loop session
# 2026-04-23.
#
# The pattern triggers when an author writes prose continuation
# like:
#
#   Full treatment in the DBSP paper
#   + `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §operator-algebra.
#
# Markdownlint parses the second line as an unordered list
# item (unexpectedly) and flags MD032 ("list not surrounded
# by blank lines"). The author-time fix is to use "and" or
# similar continuation instead of `+`.
#
# Post-setup stack: bash scaffolding — the audit ships under
# `tools/hygiene/` and has to exist in bash while the bun+TS
# post-setup migration is mid-flight (same exception as
# `audit-cross-platform-parity.sh`, `audit-missing-prevention-
# layers.sh`, and `audit-post-setup-script-stack.sh`). Queued
# for bun+TS migration alongside them in docs/BACKLOG.md.
#
# Detection shape (CommonMark-aware):
#   * Scans each line matching `^ {0,3}\+ ` (CommonMark allows
#     up to 3 leading spaces on list-marker lines).
#   * Flags a gap only when the previous line is **not blank**
#     (after stripping all whitespace: spaces, tabs, CR) **and**
#     the previous line is itself **not** a `^ {0,3}\+ ` line
#     (a contiguous list is not a gap).
#   * No file-level skip heuristic — every candidate line is
#     judged on its own per-line context, so files that mostly
#     use `+` as a list marker still get checked for stray
#     prose-continuation `+`.

#       not set and gaps found)
#   2 — gaps found and --enforce was set
