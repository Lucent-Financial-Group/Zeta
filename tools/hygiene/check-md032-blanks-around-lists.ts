// check-md032-blanks-around-lists.ts — pre-CI catch for MD032 violations.
//
// MD032 (markdownlint rule): "Lists should be surrounded by blank lines."
// Common failure mode in tick shards: a label sentence ending with `:`
// is immediately followed by a list item with no blank line between.
//
// Example (BAD — fires MD032):
//
//   Each row:
//   - id: updated
//   - title: updated
//
// Example (GOOD):
//
//   Each row:
//
//   - id: updated
//   - title: updated
//
// This helper catches the same pattern that markdownlint catches but
// runs locally (faster feedback) and pre-push (before the CI cycle).
//
// Scope: detects the most common pattern — a non-blank, non-list line
// immediately followed by a list item (`- `, `+ `, `* `, or `1. ` style).
// Markdownlint catches more variants; this is the minimal helper that
// catches the 5 recurring failures from the 2026-05-13/14 session.
//
// Exit codes:
//   0 — no findings (or no files processed)
