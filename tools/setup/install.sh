OS: NixOS live-USB

This is a NixOS live-USB environment. To install Zeta onto a target
disk, run the NixOS USB-disk installer (absolute path so it works
regardless of cwd):

  sudo bash $ZETA_INSTALL_ABS

That script handles disk partitioning, nixos-install, and the
operator-injection points (SSH pubkey, hostname, password) per:

  $INJECTION_POINTS_ABS

After the target machine reboots into installed-NixOS, run this
install.sh script again on the installed system to set up the
runtime tooling (mise + bun + agent CLIs). The same script entry —
different routing.

081KDWYPGV008QG0R002TP2RA9 (follow-up sub-row) will factor zeta-install.sh into a
callable nixos-install-from-usb.sh that this script can dispatch
to directly. Until then, this stub points operators to the
existing entry.

Exit 2 from this branch is the intentional routing guard (NOT a
dev-experience bug — see exit-code documentation in the script
header).
