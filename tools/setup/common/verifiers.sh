# Manifest format: `<target-dir>/<target-file>  <url>` per line,
# comments starting with `#`. Per the human maintainer's round-29
# call we do not verify checksums (trust-on-first-use); when
# upstream provides a published SHA256SUMS we may revisit.
#
# This replaces the legacy tools/install-verifiers.sh in the same
# commit (greenfield — no alias per GOVERNANCE.md §24 fallout).
