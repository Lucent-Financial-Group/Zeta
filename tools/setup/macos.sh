# Order matters:
#   1. Xcode Command Line Tools (prerequisite for everything else)
#   2. Homebrew (system-package source on macOS)
#   3. Brew packages from manifests/brew (currently empty after
#      round-34 JDK → mise migration)
#   4. mise (runtime manager)
#   5. common/mise.sh     — installs dotnet/python/java/bun/uv
#                           per .mise.toml
#   6. common/python-tools.sh — uv-managed Python CLI tools
#                              (ruff, etc.) from manifests/uv-tools
#   7. common/quantum.sh  — optional Q# reference-oracle deps from
#                           manifests/quantum (opt-in)
#   8. common/elan.sh     — Lean toolchain (no mise plugin yet)
#   9. common/dotnet-tools.sh — dotnet global tools (semgrep,
#                              stryker, etc.) from manifests/dotnet-tools
#  10. common/verifiers.sh    — TLA+ + Alloy jars from manifests/verifiers
#  10b. common/tlaps.sh       — TLAPS (tlapm) opam source-build, gated on
#                              ZETA_INSTALL_FULL (heavy OCaml build)
#  11. common/agent-clis.sh   — agent/peer CLIs (bun-global) from manifests/agent-clis
#  12. common/one-liner-tools.sh — non-package-manager CLIs (download-then-exec installers)
#                                  from manifests/one-liner-tools
#  13. common/local-llm.sh   — local-LLM core primitive (ollama via brew above + pinned
#                              tiny model from manifests/local-llm)
#  14. common/shellenv.sh    — managed PATH file
#  15. common/profile-edit.sh — append the managed-PATH source line to the shell profile
