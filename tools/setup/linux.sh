    # ── THE APT PHASE RUNS UNDER ONE SHARED WALL-CLOCK DEADLINE ──────
    #
    # WHY A DEADLINE AND NOT A PER-ATTEMPT TIMEOUT (the defect this closes,
    # Dejan 2026-08-18). The 2026-08-14 hang guard bounded each `apt-get
    # install` at 600s and retried 3 times. MEASURED, that is a worst case of
    # 3 x 600s + 15s + 30s of backoff = 1845s = 30.75 minutes — while EVERY job
    # that runs this script has `timeout-minutes` between 5 and 45, and the
    # tightest ones (cross-verify, lint-shell, lint-typescript, lint-markdown,
    # ci-cache-paths-lint, budget-snapshot-cadence, ...) are 5-12 minutes. So
    # on a stalling mirror the JOB was killed part-way through attempt 2 and
    # reported `cancelled`: the guard made `apt-get` RETURN, but the retry loop
    # it returned into could never finish. A guard that cannot run to
    # completion is the vacuity class — it looks like protection and constrains
    # nothing. (Live instances: gate jobs 95796893156 / 95796898144 /
    # 95797644804 / 95797644737 / 95796898139, all killed inside this step;
    # ci-cache-paths-lint run 2026-08-18T18:26Z, killed at its 5-minute mark.)
    #
    # THE SHAPE. One deadline is taken once, and update + every install attempt
    # + every backoff draw their slice from what is LEFT of it. Three attempts
    # therefore cannot exceed the wall budget no matter what each one does, and
    # the arithmetic stays correct if someone later changes the attempt count,
    # the backoff, or `timeout-minutes` — which a fixed per-attempt timeout does
    # not. `src/Core.TypeScript/hygiene/audit-apt-budget-fits-job-timeout.ts`
    # asserts the default below still fits inside EVERY job that runs install.sh,
    # alongside that job's own measured non-apt work, so a `timeout-minutes` edit
    # that breaks the relation goes red instead of going silent. It also reads the
    # `ZETA_APT_BUDGET_SECONDS` override below wherever a workflow declares it, so
    # raising the budget for one lane is checked the same way as raising it for all.
    #
    # WHY TWO DEFAULTS, AND WHY THAT IS NOT PARITY DRIFT (GOVERNANCE §24).
    # Parity is one script, one mechanism, one knob — not one constant. The
    # constraint being reconciled here (an outer job timeout that turns an
    # overrun into `cancelled`) EXISTS ONLY IN CI. On a laptop or in a
    # devcontainer there is no outer killer, so the deadline's job is only to
    # stop an unbounded hang, and a CI-sized 420s would false-fail a cold
    # 553 MB apt fetch over a home link. Both legs run the identical deadline
    # code path and honour the identical `ZETA_APT_BUDGET_SECONDS` override;
    # only the default differs, and it differs because the environments
    # genuinely differ. (Precedent: install.sh already derives ZETA_HOST_TIER
    # from GITHUB_ACTIONS for the same reason.)
    #
    # MEASURED HEALTHY COST, so the budget is sized rather than guessed: on
    # ubuntu-24.04, run 32151321559 (2026-08-18), the whole apt phase — update
    # + install of the full manifest, 553 MB fetched — took 38.2 seconds
    # (14:55:52.96 -> 14:56:31.13). The 420s CI default is ~11x that. It is
    # sized by the audit's requirement, which as of 2026-08-22 reads
    #     budget + kill_after + THIS JOB's measured non-apt seconds <= its timeout
    # per job, not once for the tightest. The earlier form of that line said
    # "+ 120s pre-apt reserve", and the reserve was defined in the audit itself as
    # "the work that PRECEDES it" — with NO term for the work that FOLLOWS. It
    # therefore passed `low-memory.yml` at 420 + 10 + 120 = 550 <= 840 while that
    # lane's non-apt work measured 571s at p90, i.e. it certified the one lane that
    # provably could not fit. The binding job now is helm-validate:structural —
    # 420 + 10 + 143 = 573 <= 600 — and low-memory is a recorded, reasoned exception
    # in audit-apt-budget-fits-job-timeout.baseline.json rather than a silent pass.
    #
    # A FIRST DRAFT OF THIS SHIPPED AT 150s AND WAS WRONG, which is worth
    # recording because the failure is subtle. 150s was pinned by three
    # FIVE-minute cadence jobs, and under the even split below it left attempt 1
    # with 45s — 1.2x the healthy cost. That bounds a STALL correctly and
    # false-fails a mirror that is merely SLOW, which is a worse trade than the
    # bug it replaced. Measured on job 95859213848: slices of 45s / 38s / 8s.
    # The three cadence jobs were raised to 12 minutes in the same commit — a
    # timeout is a cap, not a reservation, so on the healthy path (they finish
    # in ~2.5 min) it costs zero additional CI minutes.
    #
    # `timeout` converts a stall into an ordinary non-zero exit, which the
    # retry loop below and the 5-attempt install.sh wrapper in gate.yml can
    # both act on. Why apt's own timeouts do NOT catch this:
    # `Acquire::http::Timeout` is an INACTIVITY timer and a slow trickle keeps

    # ── THE ARCHIVE CACHE — the root fix for the wall-budget class ─────
    #
    # `ZETA_APT_ARCHIVES_DIR`, when set, relocates apt's `.deb` archive
    # directory (`Dir::Cache::archives`) to a caller-owned path. In CI that
    # path is restored by `.github/actions/apt-archive-cache` before this
    # script runs and saved after it, so the mirror is asked for the bytes
    # ONCE per (distro, arch, tier, package set, week) instead of once per job.
    #
    # The failure this addresses, measured: 561 MB fetched on every ubuntu job
    # against a mirror whose rate decayed to ~1.1 MB/s — ~510s of download
    # inside a 420s budget. Every attempt made forward progress; the job ran
    # out of WALL CLOCK while succeeding slowly. More retry cannot fix that
    # (three attempts already share one deadline) and the budget cannot absorb
    # it (the tightest fitting job has 18s of margin). Removing the fetch is
    # the only lever left that costs less rather than more. Full derivation:
    # docs/research/2026-08-26-caching-var-cache-apt-archives-is-the-root-fix-for-the-apt-wall-budget-class.md
    #
    # WHY A STALE CACHE CANNOT INSTALL THE WRONG PACKAGE. `apt-get update`
    # still runs on every invocation, so version RESOLUTION always comes from
    # a freshly-fetched index. apt then asks the archive directory for ONE
    # exact filename per package — `<name>_<version>_<arch>.deb` — so a
    # superseded `.deb` is not "used instead": it is never asked for.
    # Measured against ubuntu:24.04 — a planted `jq_0.0.1-1_*.deb` and a
    # wrong-arch file were both ignored entirely while the real version
    # installed from cache (`Need to get 0 B`).
    #
    # AND THE HALF THAT DID NOT HOLD, recorded because the first draft of this
    # comment asserted it. apt does NOT re-hash a file that is already in the
    # archive directory; it accepts it on FILENAME AND SIZE. A truncated
    # `.deb` is caught (wrong size ⇒ re-download, measured). A SAME-SIZE
    # tampered `.deb` is not — apt hands it to dpkg, and what refuses it is
    # dpkg's decompressor checksum: "zstd error: Restored data doesn't match
    # checksum", rc=100, loudly. So the property is "cannot install silently",
    # not "apt verifies the cache". The containment that makes that acceptable
    # is GitHub's, not apt's: a cache entry is scoped to the branch that wrote
    # it, so a pull request cannot write bytes that `main` or another pull
    # request will read. Transcripts: §3 of the doc above.
    #
    # Unset (dev laptop, devcontainer, bare Linux): every line below behaves
