// repin-rolling.ts — re-measure, then re-pin, a ROLLING from-url row.
//
// THE ONE SENTENCE THIS FILE EXISTS FOR:
//
//   BUMPING THE DIGEST WITHOUT RE-MEASURING IS THE FAILURE MODE. It is a
//   one-line diff that reads as housekeeping and is actually a verifier swap:
//   every claim the old verifier established is now resting on a verifier
//   nobody ran.
//
// A rolling row (`rolling=<name>` in tools/setup/manifests/from-url) declares
// that upstream REPLACES the asset behind the URL. The digest is still the pin
// and still fails closed; what changes is that the failure is EXPECTED and
// recurs. Measured for tla2tools on 2026-09-09: the v1.8.0 prerelease asset was
// rebuilt twice in three hours, and `tlaplus` master saw commits on 24 distinct
// days over the preceding 180. So this will fire roughly weekly, and a re-pin
// that is tedious or spread across five files is a re-pin someone will shortcut.
//
// So the re-pin is ONE COMMAND that does the whole thing in the right order and
// REFUSES TO WRITE ANYTHING PERMANENT unless the declared re-measure passed:
//
//   1. fetch the URL, hash it. Same digest  -> nothing to do, exit 0.
//   2. put the new bytes in place, keeping the old ones as <dest>.prepin.
//   3. rewrite the digest and the derived identity in every file the row
//      declares as a `pinsurfaces=` restatement, plus the manifest row itself.
//      `derivedpins=` files are those whose OWN sha256 is quoted inside a pin
//      surface (registry/tlc-models.json is quoted by nci-witness-receipt.ts);
//      their digests are recomputed after the edits and swapped too.
//   4. run the row's declared `remeasure=` argv, capturing all output.
//   5. FAILED -> restore every touched file and the old bytes, exit 1.
//      PASSED -> write the transcript as evidence and append the receipt row.
//
// The receipt is what `lint-verifier-jar-provenance.ts` demands before it will
// accept a rolling pin, so skipping this tool and hand-editing the manifest
// leaves the tree red until someone also hand-writes a receipt -- a second,
// explicit, reviewable assertion rather than a hex string in a diff.
//
// Honest limits, stated rather than implied:
//   * a hand-written receipt still passes the lint. Nothing here can tell an
//     earned attestation from a typed one; see the ledger's own header.
//   * this tool WRITES to the working tree. It never commits, never pushes,
//     and restores what it touched when the re-measure fails.
//
// Usage:
//   bun tools/setup/repin-rolling.ts --list
//   bun tools/setup/repin-rolling.ts --check <dest>   # report only; exit 1 if rebuilt
//   bun tools/setup/repin-rolling.ts <dest>           # re-measure and re-pin
//
// Exit codes:
//   0  nothing to do, or re-measured and re-pinned
//   1  a rebuild is pending (--check), or the re-measure failed
//   2  the check could not run (bad argv, unknown dest, no network, no bun)
