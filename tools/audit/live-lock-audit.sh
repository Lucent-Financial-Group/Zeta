# Aaron's 2026-04-23 directive (live-lock smell):
#   *"on some cadence look at the last few things that went into master
#   and make sure its not overwhelemginly speculative. thats a smell that
#   our software factor is live locked."*
#
# Factory-health signal: external-code motion (product surface changes)
# should not be zero over a rolling window. When it is, the factory is
# spinning on process work without shipping — live-lock.
#
# Usage: tools/audit/live-lock-audit.sh [N]
#   N defaults to 25.
# Exit 0 if healthy, 1 if smell firing (for CI / hook wiring).
