# Zeta Lean 4 formalizations

[![Lean Proof CI](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/actions/workflows/lean-proof.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Lucent-Financial-Group/Zeta/actions/workflows/lean-proof.yml)

Machine-checked formalizations of Zeta's load-bearing mathematical claims using
[Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/) +
[Mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/). Every theorem here has a
machine-checked proof body — no `sorry`, no `admit`. CI-gated against the pinned
toolchain on every PR that touches `tools/lean4/**`.

## Repository layout

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `lakefile.toml` | Lake project manifest: lean-toolchain pin + Mathlib pin at matching rev |
| `lean-toolchain` | Pinned Lean 4 toolchain (`leanprover/lean4:v4.30.0-rc1`) |
| `Lean4.lean` | Library root — imports every machine-checked module so `lake build` walks them transitively |
| `Lean4/DbspChainRule.lean` | DBSP chain rule formalization (Budiu et al. arXiv:2203.16684) |
| `ImaginaryStack/ToyModel.lean` | Imaginary-stack toy model exploration |

## Build

```bash
# Install elan + Lean toolchain (one-time setup; takes care of the
# leanprover/lean4:v4.30.0-rc1 pin in lean-toolchain)
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh

cd tools/lean4
lake build  # builds all imports of Lean4.lean against pinned Mathlib
```

First build fetches Mathlib (multi-GB) and warms the `.lake/packages/mathlib`
cache. Subsequent builds are incremental.

## DBSP chain rule artifact (`Lean4/DbspChainRule.lean`)

Formalizes the chain rule of DBSP (Database Stream Processing) per
[Budiu, McSherry, Ryzhyk, Tannen et al., *"DBSP: Automatic Incremental View
Maintenance for Rich Query Languages"*, VLDB 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16684).

### Paper-to-Lean mapping

| Paper reference | Lean theorem | Lean file:line |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Definition 3.1 (`Q^Δ := D ∘ Q ∘ I`) | `Qdelta` | `DbspChainRule.lean` Section 6 |
| Proposition 3.2 chain clause (`Qdelta(Q1 ∘ Q2) = Qdelta Q1 ∘ Qdelta Q2`, no preconditions) | `chain_rule_proposition_3_2` | `DbspChainRule.lean` Section 6 |
| Theorem 3.3 corollary (`Dop (f ∘ g) s = f (Dop g s)` for LTI `f, g`) | `Dop_LTI_commute` | `DbspChainRule.lean` Section 6 |
| Theorem 2.22 (`I ∘ D = id` on streams) | `I_D_eq` | `DbspChainRule.lean` Section 4 |
| "Fundamental theorem of DBSP calculus" (`D ∘ I = id`) | `D_I_eq` | `DbspChainRule.lean` Section 4 |
| §4.2 telescoping identity (`I (z⁻¹ s) n = I s n - s n`) | `I_zInv_eq` | `DbspChainRule.lean` Section 4 |

### Contribution beyond the paper

The paper handles operator-class distinctions informally. The Lean formalization
makes the hierarchy machine-checkable via a four-tier predicate stratification:

| Predicate | Captures | DBSP primitives satisfying |
|-----------|----------|----------------------------|
| `IsLinear` | `map_zero` + `map_add` | `D`, `I`, `zInv` |
| `IsCausal` | Output at tick `n` depends only on input ticks `0..n` | `D`, `I`, `zInv` |
| `IsTimeInvariant` | `f ∘ zInv = zInv ∘ f` (the LTI condition; Theorem 3.3) | `D`, `I`, `zInv` |
| `IsPointwiseLinear` | `∃ φ : G →+ H, ∀ s n, f s n = φ (s n)` | Pointwise-lifted scalar maps; **NOT** `D`/`I`/`zInv` (they integrate over history or shift) |

Upgrade theorems `IsPointwiseLinear.toCausal` + `IsPointwiseLinear.toTimeInvariant`
formalize the relationships the paper handles informally.

### Round-35 paper-drift audit (substrate-honest provenance)

The artifact's evolution is recorded transparently in
[`docs/research/chain-rule-proof-log.md`](../../docs/research/chain-rule-proof-log.md).
Round-35 landed three substantive corrections after a paper-drift audit against
arXiv:2203.16684 §3.1-3.2:

1. **`chain_rule` renamed** to `Dop_LTI_commute` — original name overclaimed; it
   is a Theorem-3.3 corollary, not Proposition 3.2. Old name retained as
   `@[deprecated]` alias for back-compat.
2. **B1 statement fixed** — earlier `f (fun _ => s k) k` form silently required
   pointwise-linearity; generic LTI form is `f (I s) = I (f s)`.
3. **`chain_rule` statement fixed** — earlier "expanded bilinear" eight-term form
   was unsound for composition (impulse counter-example: `f = g = id`, `s = δ₀`,
   `n = 0` gave LHS `= 1`, RHS `= 0`). Restated in classical form
   `Dop (f ∘ g) s = f (Dop g s)`.

### Future work (named in artifact)

`chain_rule_poly` — fully polymorphic bilinear chain rule over three distinct
abelian groups `G`, `H`, `J` (for general bilinear `⊗` chain rule, not just
composition). Currently named as future-round target at
`Lean4/DbspChainRule.lean:593`.

## Verification registry

Both DBSP chain rule theorems are tracked in
[`docs/research/verification-registry.md`](../../docs/research/verification-registry.md)
with provenance, audit cadence, and cross-check status.

## CI

[`.github/workflows/lean-proof.yml`](../../.github/workflows/lean-proof.yml)
runs `lake build` on every PR touching `tools/lean4/**` against the pinned
toolchain. Path-filtered to run out-of-band from the main `gate.yml` matrix
(Mathlib cache is multi-GB and toolchain setup is heavier than the dotnet/bun
gates). See workflow source for SHA-pinning + concurrency-group + minimum-
permissions details.
